0,Hired a company to complete a website. They did not complete the job. Paid $850 with $450 in escrow. Sent messages to Elance indicating the provider was not responsive and did not complete the job. Elance told me if the provider did not agree to the terms no funds will be released. Elance released funds automatically after telling me they would not unless the provider accepted the terms then told me that they would charge me $895 to arbitrate the matter. They ignored the dispute resolution phase which is supposed to be mandatory and said I did not agree to pay the $895 to arbitrate. Clearly Elance did not read the emails and allowed the provider to keep the money because they get paid a percentage of what the provider earns. I sent correspondence from support but nothing.,1,"Elance of Washington, DC"
1,"Two years ago I was hired through Elance. I completed my assigned task and the company transferred the earnings as requested. I am still waiting for the earnings to be made available to me. They said first I needed to add a profile picture which I couldn't do due to an error on their site. Then they said I needed to make an appointment on Skype to verify my identity. The only times which were available were very early in the morning or during the night. So far I have made two appointments, one at 5 am and one at 7 am. I was not contacted at either time. Still waiting for the money which I earned.",1,"Emma of Bangkok, Other"
2,"I hired a company listed as NYC studios to do my website design for $439.00. The preliminary design looked good and they requested funding to complete and deliver. When funding was forwarded, they disappeared, did not respond to requests for arbitration -- as Elance set up -- and Elance basically washed their hands of the situation saying they were only a ""service to get business people together"". They also cancelled the offending party's account, so I can't track him down to pursue legal remedy; but of course he showed up with another, undaunted. DON'T USE ELANCE OR UPWORK... THEY WILL NOT PROTECT YOU!",1,"Brian of Chestertown, MD"
3,"Woohoo. I got back my money from this ** called Elance. I was also frustrated by my Elance account suspension and even after a 1 month of email exchanges they were still holding all my payment amount. And it was more than 6000 USD which is a good amount for me. Finally, I had taken some steps and got all my money from different channel. I just don't want to post the trick here as it may be visible to Elance ** people. If anybody is interested to know, I will be happy to share the trick in personal message. ",1,"Puneet of Nyc, NJ"
4,"Several months ago, I signed up with elance.com. Elance is a marketplace that brings businesses that need writing services together with freelance writers seeking jobs. Elance claims an annual business volume of 200 million dollar or so. They recently 'merged' with Upwork, a competitor. The company has plenty of job offerings both locally and from all over the world. Jobs offered are not only writing jobs. I signed up for writing and translation. Freelance writers can potentially make lots of money if they can find customers willing to hire them. That is where elance.com comes in. They find businesses in need of writing and post the jobs on their website. Freelance writer then bid on the jobs.",1,"Peter of Wilmington, CA"
5,"I have been on Elance as a service provider for years. On Friday October 16 at 12:05 pm I received an email without any notice that my account was being put on hold because of what they deemed to be in ""violation of their terms"". I talked to a customer service rep who said I would need to speak with someone in Risk Management, but they only communicate via email. I finally got an explanation via email that they were suspicious of activity on my account in relation of a current client of mine. They seemed to think that the transactions were not real. After providing them exactly the information they asked for, they then proceeded to require me do an identity verification check, which I did. They then proceeded to ask for a verification of my credit card. A card that has already been verified and has had activity.",1,"Shannon of Lincolnton, NC"
6,"I had a 5-star rating on Elance, which means that my clients were perfectly happy with me. Out of the blue Elance sends me an email saying I have bad client feedback and I am on ""probation"" of sorts. I tried and tried again to find out who was unhappy with my work. The help person would send me back canned responses. I got mad and cancelled my account. To make matters even more frustrating, I just got an email saying that I haven't improved and so they are closing my account. So someone is unhappy with me but I am not allowed to defend myself and they can't even tell me what this was about. I don't even believe them. They lost a freelancer that was making them money--it makes no sense. If you are a freelancer STAY AWAY from Elance. They will treat you like crap.",1,"Laurie of Albuquerque, NM"
7,"Beware of Elance - Use at your own risk. I have contracted developers from Elance which have pulled out midway through, leaving me with an unfinished build and partial source codes. After filing a dispute with Elance the developer agreed to return a portion of the funds paid to him. That developer never returned the funds and removed his company and himself from Elance. When I asked Elance for assistance I was told that they could only provide me with his contact info and I could pursue this matter outside of Elance. ",1,"Patrick of Willingboro, NJ"
8,"A friend of mine recommended me Elance.com and I tried to use it. I was trying to authenticate my credit card. I was charged to authenticate my credit card and now I can't even log in at Elance.com. I always receive the same message saying: ""Your Elance account is expired"". I made 3 requests at Elance Customer Support and didn't receive any contact from them. I tried to call them and they said that they don't know what happened and they will return my contact in 48 hours. That's really a problem because I am about to lose a job opportunity because my boss was willing to pay me by Elance and now my account is expired!!!? That's seems to be scam. All my requests are ignored and you CHARGED my credit card. That's a shame.",1,"Robson of Brooklyn, NY"
9,"I received an email on 7/13 from risk management, stating they were suspicious I opened two accounts and therefore violated the terms of service agreement. I mostly use Elance as a freelancer, but recently had hired someone to help with an IT project. I have all five star reviews and have generated thousands of dollars in revenue. The risk management group went on to state my account was being ""locked"" while they investigate the duplicate account issue. Mind you, the person I hired is a man with a different name, from three states away. I am not sure how they concluded these were one person trying to sneakily create duplicate accounts.",1,"Ann of Chicago, IL"
10,"I did work through Elance in March, April of this year - earning $561.16. Without conversation or any form of open communication - they FROZE MY ACCOUNT so that I could not withdraw the money fairly earned. My customers were happy with the work I did (market research and report writing). They froze my account in early April.. It has now been THREE MONTHS - I have verified my identity and complied with all of their requests yet they are non-responsive. I have attempted via email, online customer service and telephone to discuss this yet the business unit does not speak to customers - so customer service sends a note to try and get a response. What do I need to do to withdraw MY MONEY? Could you please advise?",1,"Meg of El Dorado Hills, CA"
11,"As far as I can tell Elance/Upworth is mining information against their publicly stated policies. They froze my account and withheld my earned account balance, refusing to call me directly (it is this department's policy not to call anyone) or contact me back via email for over a day. Even though I have 5 star reviews, have been an active user for years, verified my ownership and name with multiple US banks through their website for over a year, and gave them my government issued EIN. They failed to give any explanation for the freeze until I call in. When they claimed that the bank account name differed from the contact name, I removed all business names and changed them all to the same personal name associated with the bank account. After doing this they provided no feedback, just a generic reply that directed me to a page.",1,"Jane of New York, NY"
12,"I have used Elance for years and overall I have not had issues until recently. I work with a few clients who have added me as team members so I can post jobs and hire freelancers for them. This triggered an alert so it looks like I created multiple user accounts. The support team was actually really nice but I was not contacted by the risk management team until 5 days after the support ticket was opened, and that was after 2 phone calls. There is no access to the risk management team which is very frustrating. I have sent multiple replies, made multiple phone calls, and filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureaus. It really should take no longer than 3 days to resolve an issue. 12 days is definitely too long; especially without an update.",1,"Kristie of Colorado Springs, CO"
13,"I filed a request for refund and was denied because of this: ""Dispute Resolution. There are no time sheets submitted with billable hours to dispute over. Payment of past time sheets cannot be disputed over. Disputes for hourly jobs must be filed within the 5-day 'time sheet review' period once time sheet is submitted by Freelancer.""",1,"Tim of Auburn, CA"
14,"Contracted architect to deliver construction documents for single family home. Architect bid was high, but his references appeared to be legit. Red flag #1 he was anxious to start and finish when I tried to make it a 60 project. After money was delivered on time I received renderings and simple items... but nothing I can take to a builder or bank and get estimates. When I complained I was sent more beautiful renderings. Now I was worried that he embellished his credentials to get my money. ",1,"O of Forestville , MD"
15,"Elance suddenly suspended my account. So, I can't bid on job anymore. Technical support explained me to upgrade, I did. They instructed me to verify, I did. I also verified all staff members. Somebody hacked my account and added ""Payoneer"" & ""Skrill"" account. Even after complain, no feedback form Elance. They blocked my account without any intimation, & all my earnings is probably lost. There is no positive/helpful feedback on any complaint for last 10 days.",1,"parthesh of Ahmedabad, Other"
16,"I just had my account shut down on Elance as someone who was testing the waters to hire freelancers to complete programming tasks for my startup. I have to say the one freelancer I hired who accepted a proposal did an amazing job. I had one other one who flaked out, and no bites on the 5 other jobs I posted. I think the reason my account was shut down is ludicrous. Because my jobs haven't led to activity? I posted 10 private jobs of which only 2 people applied for after I invited over 100? I don't understand why my account was suspended? If my jobs are private, it's not like others are out there trying to apply for them. Of the two people I hired, one completely flaked out on me mid-job, and the other completed the job and was paid upon completion. As far as I'm concerned their system failed me, which is why I don't understand why my account was closed? What's the point of private listings, if you have to have them fulfilled? ",1,"Michael of Los Angeles, CA"
17,"I engaged the services of a freelancer through the user of their online service. Half way through the project, I get an email indicating that both my account and the freelancer's accounts have been suspended because they suspect it was created by the same individual. Follow up calls to their customer services is answered with ""Risk Management is looking into it and will resolve it."" It has now been over 3 weeks and I don't have any resolution. They will not call you back, despite several emails and phone calls to them asking for a return call. In the meantime, I am out of the $$$ that I have paid thru their website and the project is on hold. Also, the freelancer is out of the money he was supposed to have received. The project status is on hold until they ""research it."" No timeline, no return phone calls, no follow-up despite repeated requests.",1,"Sanjay of Norcross, GA"
18,I have been calling and trying to work with Elance for the past five weeks. They have locked my account due to inactivity in my account (I hadn't filled out a status report from one of my clients). As soon as I was made aware of this I immediately took all the actions that they requested. What followed was radio silence. You cannot speak to Risk Management (who start at 12:00 EST) and they are the only people that can clear my account. I was told by one of the CS reps that people have been waiting over a month for their account and there is nothing they can do. Now I am waiting on payment of over $1000.00 and cannot accept another job from a happy client which is another $1000.00 job. The customer service reps are not empowered to do ANYTHING and the poor things just have to listen to complaints. ,1,"Courtney of Boulder, CO"
19,"In January, 2015, I hired a Freelancer via Elance to fine tune and promote my Kickstarter Campaign for my life-saving book for women. In January I made the initial $400.00 - in February the final $40.00 to complete my obligation for a fixed price account of $800.00. On 1/12/15 the Freelancer asked I release $400 from Escrow as she said funds were needed for pre-marketing campaigns, articles, press release, etc. I saw nothing. In February she asked that the other $400 in Escrow be released and that I would have product by 2/25 ""Wednesday."" To date I have received NOTHING from the Freelancer and Elance says that unless she gives them permission, I am out $800.00.",1,"Roberta of Sun City West, AZ"
20,"A well-designed user interface is extremely important for web-based services. Elance fails in this department. After writing up a job description and supposedly saving it, I was unable to find anything in the jumble that passes for a user interface. I have other complaints, but I'll just lump it all into what I consider negligence in the form of poor interfaces. I asked to have my account canceled, and Elance refuses to do that, which is why I felt compelled to make this complaint.",1,"Jeffrey of Petaluma, CA"
21,"I have worked on Elance.com for over 5 years and brought clients to the website as well. I do administrative, customer service and much more on there. I have only had a few small incidents during my time on the website. I send my friends and family there when they ask how to find legit work from home jobs. There are the occasional scammer on there, but an informed freelancer won't take those jobs. There's even a part of the help center that teaches you how to avoid the scammers. As we all know, scammers end up everywhere, even legit websites have issues keeping them away. It’s a full time job.",1,"Kimberly of Carlisle, PA"
22,"I asked Elance for a refund, but their customer service is poor and they told me they ""never received a complaint"". ** is the worst of the worst. I basically held his hand and gave him more than enough information (SQL Fiddle with proper data, a somewhat working query, and explicit instructions) and he still dropped the ball. He kept sending me queries which were exactly not what I asked for, and after I told him this, he tried sending me random queries and asked me to ""try them out"". They didn't even return what I was looking for in the SQL Fiddle much less my actual site. I would NOT recommend him, and frankly, I wouldn't recommend Elance either. Please be careful of this Elance scammer, he just stolen from me $700! When you authorize it to do the job, he just asks for more money and claim you did not describe properly the task. Be careful!!!",1,"DGC of Dfgs, Other"
23,"After reading a job spec from Elance (the first time I have come across that agency) I was interested in the work but replied asking for more information and suggesting that they try to use more correct English. After a couple of exchanges in which no useful information was added I got a reply from them (from Hardik **) as follows: ""I think your not right candidate. Take your knowledge with you."" If Elance is looking to find people willing to take on work they should be thinking about providing more complete job specs and providing better staff training.",1,"Andrew of London, Other"
24,"Without any prior notice elance stop expired my account even I have existing contract with 450$ a month. They should not close this account even some bad issue. They can limit feature but I totally disagree, they will not close an account. They should warn. Elance scam my money more than 1000k in future life income. I must go to court and get official notice. It's our career issue. So if you work hard, take exam test and other hard work all will be vain.",1,"Kazi of Dhaka, Other"
25,"Elance has been a good place to do freelance work and grow my business. But recently, there has been a number of scammers that use their site to get free work done. They pass verification and are allowed to hire on Elance. I have lost over $1,000 to these scammers and also have gone through a lot of stress and mental torment. They have refused to help me out and even suspended my freelance account with them, so I am being penalized for bringing scammers to their attention. It is my fault that disputes has risen from scammers that they allow in their platform. They have it in fine print that they provide a guarantee for payment but they did not follow it and decided to suspend me. I am hoping to find a way to make them liable for this.",1,"Danny of Manila, OTHER"
26,"Elance abuses privacy!  I have just been informed by a third party that Elance released my transaction history!  This third party is not a registered user of Elance, there was no subpoena, no warrant and no request from any law enforcement agency.  But this third party was able to send several well-crafted emails to Elance inquiring about my account, acting as a third party and was able to get access to my transactional history.  Be warned of Elance.  They do not protect your privacy.",1,"Greg of Sydney, Other"
27,"I joined Elance and paid the $20 monthly fee. I bid on two jobs, was awarded one, and successfully completed that job. The client marked it completed, paid me through Elance's system and left positive feedback. When I next signed in two days later, my Elance account was blocked from viewing any new job postings. I contacted Elance seven times before receiving their response, which was that they had a problem, not with me but with someone else's account. They couldn't tell me the nature of that problem out of privacy concerns, but until the other account holder resolved the problem I could not view any new job postings. Elance did quietly refund my money, but they are refusing to remove the block on my account or adequately explain why it was ever imposed. So two stars because they did refund my money, but what a bizarre way to conduct business. I cannot recommend Elance. ",1,"Douglas of Park Ridge, IL"

After writing up a job description and supposedly saving it, I was unable to find anything in the jumble that passes for a user interface. I have other complaints, but I'll just lump it all into what I consider negligence in the form of poor interfaces. I asked to have my account canceled, and Elance refuses to do that, which is why I felt compelled to make this complaint.",2,"Jeffrey of Petaluma, CA"
49,"I have worked on Elance.com for over 5 years and brought clients to the website as well. I do administrative, customer service and much more on there. I have only had a few small incidents during my time on the website. I send my friends and family there when they ask how to find legit work from home jobs. There are the occasional scammer on there, but an informed freelancer won't take those jobs. There's even a part of the help center that teaches you how to avoid the scammers. As we all know, scammers end up everywhere, even legit websites have issues keeping them away. It’s a full time job.",2,"Kimberly of Carlisle, PA"
50,"I asked Elance for a refund, but their customer service is poor and they told me they ""never received a complaint"". ** is the worst of the worst. I basically held his hand and gave him more than enough information (SQL Fiddle with proper data, a somewhat working query, and explicit instructions) and he still dropped the ball. He kept sending me queries which were exactly not what I asked for, and after I told him this, he tried sending me random queries and asked me to ""try them out"". They didn't even return what I was looking for in the SQL Fiddle much less my actual site. I would NOT recommend him, and frankly, I wouldn't recommend Elance either. Please be careful of this Elance scammer, he just stolen from me $700! When you authorize it to do the job, he just asks for more money and claim you did not describe properly the task. Be careful!!!",2,"DGC of Dfgs, Other"
51,"After reading a job spec from Elance (the first time I have come across that agency) I was interested in the work but replied asking for more information and suggesting that they try to use more correct English. After a couple of exchanges in which no useful information was added I got a reply from them (from Hardik **) as follows: ""I think your not right candidate. Take your knowledge with you."" If Elance is looking to find people willing to take on work they should be thinking about providing more complete job specs and providing better staff training.",2,"Andrew of London, Other"
52,"Without any prior notice elance stop expired my account even I have existing contract with 450$ a month. They should not close this account even some bad issue. They can limit feature but I totally disagree, they will not close an account. They should warn. Elance scam my money more than 1000k in future life income. I must go to court and get official notice. It's our career issue. So if you work hard, take exam test and other hard work all will be vain.",2,"Kazi of Dhaka, Other"
53,"Elance has been a good place to do freelance work and grow my business. But recently, there has been a number of scammers that use their site to get free work done. They pass verification and are allowed to hire on Elance. I have lost over $1,000 to these scammers and also have gone through a lot of stress and mental torment. They have refused to help me out and even suspended my freelance account with them, so I am being penalized for bringing scammers to their attention. It is my fault that disputes has risen from scammers that they allow in their platform. They have it in fine print that they provide a guarantee for payment but they did not follow it and decided to suspend me. I am hoping to find a way to make them liable for this.",2,"Danny of Manila, OTHER"
54,"Elance abuses privacy!  I have just been informed by a third party that Elance released my transaction history!  This third party is not a registered user of Elance, there was no subpoena, no warrant and no request from any law enforcement agency.

Be warned of Elance.  They do not protect your privacy.",2,"Greg of Sydney, Other"
55,"I joined Elance and paid the $20 monthly fee. I bid on two jobs, was awarded one, and successfully completed that job. The client marked it completed, paid me through Elance's system and left positive feedback. When I next signed in two days later, my Elance account was blocked from viewing any new job postings. I contacted Elance seven times before receiving their response, which was that they had a problem, not with me but with someone else's account. They couldn't tell me the nature of that problem out of privacy concerns, but until the other account holder resolved the problem I could not view any new job postings. Elance did quietly refund my money, but they are refusing to remove the block on my account or adequately explain why it was ever imposed. So two stars because they did refund my money, but what a bizarre way to conduct business. I cannot recommend Elance. ",2,"Douglas of Park Ridge, IL"
56,Hired a company to complete a website. They did not complete the job. Paid $850 with $450 in escrow. Sent messages to Elance indicating the provider was not responsive and did not complete the job. Elance told me if the provider did not agree to the terms no funds will be released. Elance released funds automatically after telling me they would not unless the provider accepted the terms then told me that they would charge me $895 to arbitrate the matter. They ignored the dispute resolution phase which is supposed to be mandatory and said I did not agree to pay the $895 to arbitrate. Clearly Elance did not read the emails and allowed the provider to keep the money because they get paid a percentage of what the provider earns. I sent correspondence from support but nothing.,3,"Elance of Washington, DC"
57,"Two years ago I was hired through Elance. I completed my assigned task and the company transferred the earnings as requested. I am still waiting for the earnings to be made available to me. They said first I needed to add a profile picture which I couldn't do due to an error on their site. Then they said I needed to make an appointment on Skype to verify my identity. The only times which were available were very early in the morning or during the night. So far I have made two appointments, one at 5 am and one at 7 am. I was not contacted at either time. Still waiting for the money which I earned.",3,"Emma of Bangkok, Other"
58,"I hired a company listed as NYC studios to do my website design for $439.00. The preliminary design looked good and they requested funding to complete and deliver.

They also cancelled the offending party's account, so I can't track him down to pursue legal remedy; but of course he showed up with another, undaunted. DON'T USE ELANCE OR UPWORK... THEY WILL NOT PROTECT YOU!",3,"Brian of Chestertown, MD"
59,"Woohoo. I got back my money from this ** called Elance. I was also frustrated by my Elance account suspension and even after a 1 month of email exchanges they were still holding all my payment amount.

I just don't want to post the trick here as it may be visible to Elance ** people. If anybody is interested to know, I will be happy to share the trick in personal message. ",3,"Puneet of Nyc, NJ"
60,"Several months ago, I signed up with elance.com. Elance is a marketplace that brings businesses that need writing services together with freelance writers seeking jobs. Elance claims an annual business volume of 200 million dollar or so. They recently 'merged' with Upwork, a competitor. The company has plenty of job offerings both locally and from all over the world. Jobs offered are not only writing jobs. I signed up for writing and translation. Freelance writers can potentially make lots of money if they can find customers willing to hire them. That is where elance.com comes in. They find businesses in need of writing and post the jobs on their website. Freelance writer then bid on the jobs.",3,"Peter of Wilmington, CA"

I talked to a customer service rep who said I would need to speak with someone in Risk Management, but they only communicate via email. I finally got an explanation via email that they were suspicious of activity on my account in relation of a current client of mine. They seemed to think that the transactions were not real. After providing them exactly the information they asked for, they then proceeded to require me do an identity verification check, which I did. They then proceeded to ask for a verification of my credit card. A card that has already been verified and has had activity.",3,"Shannon of Lincolnton, NC"
62,"I had a 5-star rating on Elance, which means that my clients were perfectly happy with me. Out of the blue Elance sends me an email saying I have bad client feedback and I am on ""probation"" of sorts. I tried and tried again to find out who was unhappy with my work. The help person would send me back canned responses. I got mad and cancelled my account. To make matters even more frustrating, I just got an email saying that I haven't improved and so they are closing my account. So someone is unhappy with me but I am not allowed to defend myself and they can't even tell me what this was about. I don't even believe them. They lost a freelancer that was making them money--it makes no sense. If you are a freelancer STAY AWAY from Elance. They will treat you like crap.",3,"Laurie of Albuquerque, NM"

I made 3 requests at Elance Customer Support and didn't receive any contact from them. I tried to call them and they said that they don't know what happened and they will return my contact in 48 hours. That's really a problem because I am about to lose a job opportunity because my boss was willing to pay me by Elance and now my account is expired!!!? That's seems to be scam. All my requests are ignored and you CHARGED my credit card. That's a shame.",3,"Robson of Brooklyn, NY"

The risk management group went on to state my account was being ""locked"" while they investigate the duplicate account issue.

It has now been THREE MONTHS - I have verified my identity and complied with all of their requests yet they are non-responsive. I have attempted via email, online customer service and telephone to discuss this yet the business unit does not speak to customers - so customer service sends a note to try and get a response. What do I need to do to withdraw MY MONEY? Could you please advise?",3,"Meg of El Dorado Hills, CA"
67,"As far as I can tell Elance/Upworth is mining information against their publicly stated policies.

Even though I have 5 star reviews, have been an active user for years, verified my ownership and name with multiple US banks through their website for over a year, and gave them my government issued EIN. They failed to give any explanation for the freeze until I call in. When they claimed that the bank account name differed from the contact name, I removed all business names and changed them all to the same personal name associated with the bank account. After doing this they provided no feedback, just a generic reply that directed me to a page.",3,"Jane of New York, NY"
68,"I have used Elance for years and overall I have not had issues until recently. I work with a few clients who have added me as team members so I can post jobs and hire freelancers for them. This triggered an alert so it looks like I created multiple user accounts. The support team was actually really nice but I was not contacted by the risk management team until 5 days after the support ticket was opened, and that was after 2 phone calls. There is no access to the risk management team which is very frustrating. I have sent multiple replies, made multiple phone calls, and filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureaus.

72,"I just had my account shut down on Elance as someone who was testing the waters to hire freelancers to complete programming tasks for my startup. I have to say the one freelancer I hired who accepted a proposal did an amazing job. I had one other one who flaked out, and no bites on the 5 other jobs I posted. I think the reason my account was shut down is ludicrous. Because my jobs haven't led to activity? I posted 10 private jobs of which only 2 people applied for after I invited over 100? I don't understand why my account was suspended? If my jobs are private, it's not like others are out there trying to apply for them. Of the two people I hired, one completely flaked out on me mid-job, and the other completed the job and was paid upon completion. As far as I'm concerned their system failed me, which is why I don't understand why my account was closed? What's the point of private listings, if you have to have them fulfilled?

They will not call you back, despite several emails and phone calls to them asking for a return call. In the meantime, I am out of the $$$ that I have paid thru their website and the project is on hold. Also, the freelancer is out of the money he was supposed to have received.

74,I have been calling and trying to work with Elance for the past five weeks. They have locked my account due to inactivity in my account (I hadn't filled out a status report from one of my clients). As soon as I was made aware of this I immediately took all the actions that they requested. What followed was radio silence. You cannot speak to Risk Management (who start at 12:00 EST) and they are the only people that can clear my account. I was told by one of the CS reps that people have been waiting over a month for their account and there is nothing they can do. Now I am waiting on payment of over $1000.00 and cannot accept another job from a happy client which is another $1000.00 job.

There is no access to the risk management team which is very frustrating. I have sent multiple replies, made multiple phone calls, and filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureaus. It really should take no longer than 3 days to resolve an issue. 12 days is definitely too long; especially without an update.",4,"Kristie of Colorado Springs, CO"
97,"I filed a request for refund and was denied because of this: ""Dispute Resolution. There are no time sheets submitted with billable hours to dispute over.

98,"Contracted architect to deliver construction documents for single family home. Architect bid was high, but his references appeared to be legit.

Now I was worried that he embellished his credentials to get my money. ",4,"O of Forestville , MD"
99,"Elance suddenly suspended my account. So, I can't bid on job anymore. Technical support explained me to upgrade, I did. They instructed me to verify, I did. I also verified all staff members. Somebody hacked my account and added ""Payoneer"" & ""Skrill"" account. Even after complain, no feedback form Elance. They blocked my account without any intimation, & all my earnings is probably lost. There is no positive/helpful feedback on any complaint for last 10 days.",4,"parthesh of Ahmedabad, Other"
100,"I just had my account shut down on Elance as someone who was testing the waters to hire freelancers to complete programming tasks for my startup. I have to say the one freelancer I hired who accepted a proposal did an amazing job. I had one other one who flaked out, and no bites on the 5 other jobs I posted. I think the reason my account was shut down is ludicrous. Because my jobs haven't led to activity? I posted 10 private jobs of which only 2 people applied for after I invited over 100? I don't understand why my account was suspended? If my jobs are private, it's not like others are out there trying to apply for them. Of the two people I hired, one completely flaked out on me mid-job, and the other completed the job and was paid upon completion. As far as I'm concerned their system failed me, which is why I don't understand why my account was closed? What's the point of private listings, if you have to have them fulfilled?

101,"I engaged the services of a freelancer through the user of their online service. Half way through the project, I get an email indicating that both my account and the freelancer's accounts have been suspended because they suspect it was created by the same individual. Follow up calls to their customer services is answered with ""Risk Management is looking into it and will resolve it."" It has now been over 3 weeks and I don't have any resolution. They will not call you back, despite several emails and phone calls to them asking for a return call. In the meantime, I am out of the $$$ that I have paid thru their website and the project is on hold. Also, the freelancer is out of the money he was supposed to have received. The project status is on hold until they ""research it."" No timeline, no return phone calls, no follow-up despite repeated requests.",4,"Sanjay of Norcross, GA"
102,I have been calling and trying to work with Elance for the past five weeks. They have locked my account due to inactivity in my account (I hadn't filled out a status report from one of my clients). As soon as I was made aware of this I immediately took all the actions that they requested. What followed was radio silence. You cannot speak to Risk Management (who start at 12:00 EST) and they are the only people that can clear my account. I was told by one of the CS reps that people have been waiting over a month for their account and there is nothing they can do. Now I am waiting on payment of over $1000.00 and cannot accept another job from a happy client which is another $1000.00 job. The customer service reps are not empowered to do ANYTHING and the poor things just have to listen to complaints. ,4,"Courtney of Boulder, CO"

In January I made the initial $400.00 - in February the final $40.00 to complete my obligation for a fixed price account of $800.00. On 1/12/15 the Freelancer asked I release $400 from Escrow as she said funds were needed for pre-marketing campaigns, articles, press release, etc. I saw nothing. In February she asked that the other $400 in Escrow be released and that I would have product by 2/25 ""Wednesday.""

105,"I have worked on Elance.com for over 5 years and brought clients to the website as well. I do administrative, customer service and much more on there. I have only had a few small incidents during my time on the website. I send my friends and family there when they ask how to find legit work from home jobs. There are the occasional scammer on there, but an informed freelancer won't take those jobs. There's even a part of the help center that teaches you how to avoid the scammers. As we all know, scammers end up everywhere, even legit websites have issues keeping them away. It’s a full time job.",4,"Kimberly of Carlisle, PA"
106,"I asked Elance for a refund, but their customer service is poor and they told me they ""never received a complaint"". ** is the worst of the worst. I basically held his hand and gave him more than enough information (SQL Fiddle with proper data, a somewhat working query, and explicit instructions) and he still dropped the ball. He kept sending me queries which were exactly not what I asked for, and after I told him this, he tried sending me random queries and asked me to ""try them out"". They didn't even return what I was looking for in the SQL Fiddle much less my actual site. I would NOT recommend him, and frankly, I wouldn't recommend Elance either. Please be careful of this Elance scammer, he just stolen from me $700! When you authorize it to do the job, he just asks for more money and claim you did not describe properly the task. Be careful!!!",4,"DGC of Dfgs, Other"
107,"After reading a job spec from Elance (the first time I have come across that agency) I was interested in the work but replied asking for more information and suggesting that they try to use more correct English.

They have refused to help me out and even suspended my freelance account with them, so I am being penalized for bringing scammers to their attention.

This third party is not a registered user of Elance, there was no subpoena, no warrant and no request from any law enforcement agency.

Be warned of Elance.  They do not protect your privacy.",4,"Greg of Sydney, Other"
111,"I joined Elance and paid the $20 monthly fee. I bid on two jobs, was awarded one, and successfully completed that job. The client marked it completed, paid me through Elance's system and left positive feedback. When I next signed in two days later, my Elance account was blocked from viewing any new job postings. I contacted Elance seven times before receiving their response, which was that they had a problem, not with me but with someone else's account. They couldn't tell me the nature of that problem out of privacy concerns, but until the other account holder resolved the problem I could not view any new job postings. Elance did quietly refund my money, but they are refusing to remove the block on my account or adequately explain why it was ever imposed. So two stars because they did refund my money, but what a bizarre way to conduct business. I cannot recommend Elance. ",4,"Douglas of Park Ridge, IL"
112,Hired a company to complete a website. They did not complete the job. Paid $850 with $450 in escrow. Sent messages to Elance indicating the provider was not responsive and did not complete the job. Elance told me if the provider did not agree to the terms no funds will be released. Elance released funds automatically after telling me they would not unless the provider accepted the terms then told me that they would charge me $895 to arbitrate the matter. They ignored the dispute resolution phase which is supposed to be mandatory and said I did not agree to pay the $895 to arbitrate. Clearly Elance did not read the emails and allowed the provider to keep the money because they get paid a percentage of what the provider earns. I sent correspondence from support but nothing.,5,"Elance of Washington, DC"
113,"Two years ago I was hired through Elance. I completed my assigned task and the company transferred the earnings as requested. I am still waiting for the earnings to be made available to me. They said first I needed to add a profile picture which I couldn't do due to an error on their site. Then they said I needed to make an appointment on Skype to verify my identity. The only times which were available were very early in the morning or during the night. So far I have made two appointments, one at 5 am and one at 7 am. I was not contacted at either time. Still waiting for the money which I earned.",5,"Emma of Bangkok, Other"
114,"I hired a company listed as NYC studios to do my website design for $439.00. The preliminary design looked good and they requested funding to complete and deliver. When funding was forwarded, they disappeared, did not respond to requests for arbitration -- as Elance set up -- and Elance basically washed their hands of the situation saying they were only a ""service to get business people together"". They also cancelled the offending party's account, so I can't track him down to pursue legal remedy; but of course he showed up with another, undaunted. DON'T USE ELANCE OR UPWORK... THEY WILL NOT PROTECT YOU!",5,"Brian of Chestertown, MD"
115,"Woohoo. I got back my money from this ** called Elance. I was also frustrated by my Elance account suspension and even after a 1 month of email exchanges they were still holding all my payment amount.

I just don't want to post the trick here as it may be visible to Elance ** people. If anybody is interested to know, I will be happy to share the trick in personal message. ",5,"Puneet of Nyc, NJ"
116,"Several months ago, I signed up with elance.com. Elance is a marketplace that brings businesses that need writing services together with freelance writers seeking jobs. Elance claims an annual business volume of 200 million dollar or so. They recently 'merged' with Upwork, a competitor. The company has plenty of job offerings both locally and from all over the world. Jobs offered are not only writing jobs. I signed up for writing and translation. Freelance writers can potentially make lots of money if they can find customers willing to hire them. That is where elance.com comes in. They find businesses in need of writing and post the jobs on their website. Freelance writer then bid on the jobs.",5,"Peter of Wilmington, CA"

I talked to a customer service rep who said I would need to speak with someone in Risk Management, but they only communicate via email. I finally got an explanation via email that they were suspicious of activity on my account in relation of a current client of mine. They seemed to think that the transactions were not real. After providing them exactly the information they asked for, they then proceeded to require me do an identity verification check, which I did. They then proceeded to ask for a verification of my credit card. A card that has already been verified and has had activity.",5,"Shannon of Lincolnton, NC"
118,"I had a 5-star rating on Elance, which means that my clients were perfectly happy with me. Out of the blue Elance sends me an email saying I have bad client feedback and I am on ""probation"" of sorts. I tried and tried again to find out who was unhappy with my work. The help person would send me back canned responses. I got mad and cancelled my account. To make matters even more frustrating, I just got an email saying that I haven't improved and so they are closing my account. So someone is unhappy with me but I am not allowed to defend myself and they can't even tell me what this was about. I don't even believe them. They lost a freelancer that was making them money--it makes no sense. If you are a freelancer STAY AWAY from Elance. They will treat you like crap.",5,"Laurie of Albuquerque, NM"

I made 3 requests at Elance Customer Support and didn't receive any contact from them. I tried to call them and they said that they don't know what happened and they will return my contact in 48 hours. That's really a problem because I am about to lose a job opportunity because my boss was willing to pay me by Elance and now my account is expired!!!? That's seems to be scam.

The risk management group went on to state my account was being ""locked"" while they investigate the duplicate account issue.

It has now been THREE MONTHS - I have verified my identity and complied with all of their requests yet they are non-responsive.

Even though I have 5 star reviews, have been an active user for years, verified my ownership and name with multiple US banks through their website for over a year, and gave them my government issued EIN. They failed to give any explanation for the freeze until I call in. When they claimed that the bank account name differed from the contact name, I removed all business names and changed them all to the same personal name associated with the bank account.
