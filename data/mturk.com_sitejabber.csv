That is my TIME wasted that I can never get back. Not even able to email the requestor to tell her that she wasted my time on her survey  $1.25 I was trying to earn for that damn survey. So many damn questions, at least 70, I answered all and at the end after it thanked me for taking the survey, I get REJECTED; which means no payment. My survey was completed but I won't get paid. I am $#*!ing pissed. So glad when i get a regular job and not have to go through this $#*!.

No one wanted to take a responsibility and take an action. From buyers on Amazon we see lots of negative reviews about this issue.Amazon Payment Inc, collect payments and mail not activated cards!

Next thing you know they started withdrawing money from my account - it bounced, so i called and emailed them to get rid of the account because i couldn't delete it. they said okay and then try tried again to take the money. so by the 3rd day it's bounced 3 times and they took the 39.95 and never gave it back. So I reported them to the BBB. Very unhappy with this site. It turned out to be a nightmare before even working with them.",1,“they took my money and wont return it”

8,"This is a site used by marketers and Universities to collect low cost survey data and repetitive task completion for minimal fees. In many instances, workers who complete tasks as per the directions receive payment.

However, as anyone who has been burnt by these scheming requesters who mess it up for all of the others well knows there are certain unscrupulous requester types who use the Amazon.com mturk system to ends more sinister than access to an unsuspecting pool of cheap labor.

These requesters follow a self serving ethic presumably motivated by the ease with which they can reject work and save themselves the fees they have already agreed to and are required to pay. A stiffed worker has no recourse through Amazon. There is no appeals process or investigation by Amazon. A requester can only be reported before the worker has any experience with her and only for a very narrow range of complaints  evading work payment is not one of them. It gets worse. The rejection and any untrue reason(s) provided by the requester through the automated Amazon system in bad faith have a deleterious impact on the profile of the workers who have already been denied payment for their work.

The Congress needs to take a deeper look at this mturk system, which conceals these types of business practices behind the shield of a contract worker arrangement provided by the shrink wrapped, boilerplate adhesion language in their TOS. Legislature and the courts need to further assess the whole system to gauge its compliance with basic levels of public policy, acceptable in the reasonable standards expected in an industrialized nation.

If such systemic false pretense routinely engaged in by those requesters who make use of the mturk system to actively pursue the above-mentioned practices does not enumerate as the key elements of material fraud, then how else is it reasonably described?

There is no rating system of the requesters provided by Amazon. Mturk workers are in the dark when accepting a work hit that could result in non payment by one of these unscrupulous requesters meeting the above definitions. In the interim, a plug-in such as the one provided by Turkopticon can provide some minimal measure, though incomplete because of its 3rd party implementation, forewarning to the mturk worker pool.",1,“mturk provides TOS shield for fraud-engaging requesters” 
9,"It isn't a scam but it doesn't make much money. According to Forbes ""estimates of what workers can earn on these crowdsourced tasks range from about $1.20 to $5 an hour without any benefits.

10,"What a joke I could not use amazon turk because of the stupid amazon payments why? Because for some reason they disabled my account because they could not confirm my information, but would they tell me what info no. How can I fix this they said you cant. end of story.

What the hell about a review process is proprietary? Are you kidding? What was proprietary about it? It is because they only hire Americans now.

15,"I originally reviewed Amazon Mechanical Turk as a good place to work for a little extra spending money, and I still stand by that review. However, from a customer service aspect it is horrible. 

Be careful of the HITS you accept. If you are doing HITS for a new requester. Do only a few HITS first and wait and see if they reject or accept and how long they take to do that and pay you. You could waste hours and have many HITS rejected (without knowing why) which will bring down your rating and could cause AMAZON to freeze or block your account.

Amazon also randomly suspends accounts because you will be treated as an algorithm and not a human. 

Be careful about keeping money sitting in your account without moving it quickly. You could get suspended for unknown reasons and lose your earnings. This happens quit frequently. Suspensions happen for real reasons to protect the site but also for reasons unknown with no fault of yours. 

Reaching customer service and resolving these problems tend to be futile and you will likely be given a canned response email. It still can be good place to make extra money, just be aware of what could happen and protect yourself first.",2,“Be Careful / Important Advice Before You Start”

19,We create a new account last month in mturk but we get declined mail. it possible to accept in future.,3,“About new registeration” 
20,"Mechanical Turk was originally a way for people all over the world, and in poor countries in particular, to make small amounts of money easily. By 2011, there were workers in 190 countries. Because a mastery of English is necessary, at some point Amazon started taking only American applications. (If anyone knows when the change was made, let us know in your review.) 

Because workers are independent contractors, i.e. self-employed,  the US minimum wage law doesn't apply. So there's no Turk in Third World countries, where a few dollars can be meaningful income, while Americans create all sorts of ways to be successful at working for pennies. That's the irony.",3,“The irony of MT” 
21,"I've been doing this since February, and I've made a little over $1000 now. Yes, it's low paying and not a quick get-rich type of thing at all. But it pays for my food, gas, and pocket money every week, letting me save more money from my regular full time job. Mind you, I'm the type of person who gets excited to find pennies, dimes, and nickels on the sidewalks, so this works for me. I don't put a lot of effort into it, since it's only pocket change for me. I do it while I'm at work, and sometimes at night. Some people get real crazy, setting alarms to snatch up good-paying HITs in the middle of the night from international requestors, working on them for 8 hours a day, etc. I do it mostly as a hobby, and don't get too crazy. If I'm working on a HIT and I don't feel it's worth it, I just return it and do another one. You will start to know which ones are worth your time, and which ones you enjoy doing the best. I did try and do this for 5+ hours a day once, and it drove me crazy. I could never do this as a full time job, because I wouldn't have what it takes. You have to really pay attention to everything you do, read every single word, and submit everything in the correct way, or you might not be paid. The highest paid HIT I've done was $6 for about 40 minutes. There are some fun HITs on here every now and then, too. Even the smaller $.05 or $.10 cent HITs sometimes are a gem, because they include bigger bonuses in them. I choose to have the money direct deposited into my bank, and it takes less than 24 hours to hit my bank account. You are a contractor for them, so yes, you will have to pay taxes on your income when the time comes. Keep that in mind.",4,“Good way to make extra cash”

23,"I work on Amazon Mechanical Turk and there are many dollar amounts to be made. 
It is great for small amounts at a time . 
The money can go directly to your bank or Amazon account.
2 Draw backs I can see is the time it takes to get paid from some hits you do and being able to get paid through Pay Pal. That would be good if they did that.",4,“Good Online work” 
24,"I haven't come across any problems with it.  I came across mturk from a friend who uses it. I admit i was a bit skeptical at first when mturk needed my SS information (but that's only for verification so you can receive payment once you cash out) and I love it. The hits are easy and approved quite quickly.

I will continue to use mturk. Love it.",4,“I love mturk” 
25,"MTurk is a great place for people looking to make a few extra bucks in their free time, however, there are a small group of people who actually make a living there. Better paying hits open up as you rack up bigger and better numbers. Be careful to keep your acceptance rate over 90% if you want the best hits. The Turkopticon add-on is a must to weed out the bad requesters. Pay is daily if you have $1 to claim, and you can easily transfer your earnings to your bank account. The site is very secure. I've never had a problem with losing any money.

All-in-all, a good site, but not without its flaws, which is why I give it a 4. Most people give up too easily, and are not willing to learn the system or work hard enough to make it work for them.

27,"I would really like to give this site five stars.  Essentially ""Mechanical Turk Requesters"" ask mturk.com to accomplish a set of tasks, tasks that ""Mechanical Turk Workers"" then accomplish.  Requesters and Workers need never actually contact each other.

I think automating the relationship of people who need to get tasks done and people who want to accomplish these tasks for some kind of incentive in the fashion that ""Amazon's Mechanical Turk"" does this is awesome and could most likely be the future of a large portion of labor.

It disheartens me, however, that a lot of this work is antithetical to the hacker ethic in specific and putting human potential to its highest, best use in that it can not only be quite a bit tedious at times but also not compensate very well for the amount of work involved.  Compounding this, instructions with some Requesters can be very vague and as you get no instantaneous feedback on your work, this can damage your ratings, restricting you from being able to take on more choice tasks, if you do a lot of tasks in a row incorrectly.

Also, I am too often left only hoping that the goals of the tasks I take on are in agreement with my own values.",4,“I would really like to give this site five stars” 
28,"I have been using this site for about 8 months now. As the previous reviewer said, the HITs pay from $.01 to $20.00 and up. Generally, the harder the task, the more money you will be paid (obviously) and the more qualified you have to be. For the HIT's that require qualification, you need to take the given test and pass it to be able to qualify. Basically, the more time you spend on here the more money you will make. One can make a good amount of money on here. Certainly not a sole income but definitely some spending money or some money to put away in savings or something. I've been paid for taking quizzes, surveys, transcribing audio, editing written assignments, and some other odd jobs. It can be fun too!",4,“I have been using this site for about 8 months now” 
29,I've been a turker since 2016 and have made money to add to my Amazon gift card balance or to transfer to my bank. It doesn't pay much but the work isn't difficult.

HITS include identifying objects in a photo or video, performing data de-duplication, transcribing audio recordings, or researching data details etc. I've been working on Mturk since 2010. Any one with knowledge in english can work on it. Now I am a trusted worker with 98.4% accuracy and worked on more than 42000 Hits. I recommend this to all those who wish to earn some money by doing transcriptions, surveys, playing interactive games (as part of survey).",5,“Super Site I've ever worked” 
33,"For starters, you only need to accumulate 1 dollar in your account to cash out and you should always quickly receive your payout as a direct deposit in your bank account. Mturk offers many tasks, or HITs that you can qualify for and complete relatively quickly. Many of the tasks pay well and almost all of the requesters for the tasks are honest and will pay you for your task completion. 

However, the fraud rate seems to be creeping up; whereas the rate for not getting conned out of getting paid for completing surveys was close to 100 %, the rate has gone down to about 90 % for me. Although it's unfortunate for this to ever happen, I find Mturk to probably be the best money-paying site for survey takers and task participants dollar for dollar.",5,“How Mturk is great for making extra money”
