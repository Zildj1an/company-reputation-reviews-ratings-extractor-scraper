0,"I recently completed an order for $600.

The buyer filed a dispute because apparently 2% of the work was not completed successfully, this was the excuse anyway.

I denied the refund and Fiverr refunded them IN FULL, and WITHOUT even contacting me.

I opened a support request, actually 9 of them and FIverr started to close them out without even replying to reading them

I went above them to BBB, again on there, the same thing, they would reply once with little to no content, then that allowed them to close out the complaint.

Stay away from these criminals. It's a downright scam. They take 10% from buyers and 10% from sellers, their support system is AWFUL, they favor buyers 100% and there is no comeback as a seller. AVOID AVOID AVOID",1,“Fiverr are scammers” 
1,"I've used Fiverr professionally and personally. By using Fiverr, you basically are accepting crap work. Most of the profiles are fake and there are groups of fiver sellers from other countries that work together by giving each other good ratings. When you complain, Fiverr does absolutely nothing to help you. It's a great scam to the unsuspecting. Then you accept crap for work and have to do it yourself anyway. Finally, DO NOT send any data to a seller that has any value like a book idea. That seller will take your ideas and you will not hear from that fake seller again. I'll NEVER use Fiverr again. I can't say enough bad things about that group of scammers.",1,“Stay away from this scam site.” 
2,"After my negative experience with Upwork I've been suggested to try out Fiverr. I wasn't really sure at first, but then I decided to try it out and create an account there as well, which I honestly regret.

I spent half a day creating a proper profile with at least two big gigs. I even followed tips and tricks all around to be sure I was doing things properly and that said gigs would make me earn and gain experience soon enough.

Well, once again, that was all for nothing.

The thing is, there are a lot of sellers who advertise Fiverr like the best place to make easy money while that doesn't seem to be true. First of all, the moment you are done with your gig and ready to apply for jobs, you simply find out there is no real way to do that. The site doesn't even explain this and I had to Google ""how to apply for jobs on Fiverr"" in order to figure it out. You can open the buyer requests that should be tied to your gig and tags, but the problem is whenever I checked that section, there literally were 0 requests from 0 buyers... meaning no jobs I could apply to. 

I waited for some time, polishing the gigs every now and then, only to remove my account in the end. Not recommended.",1,“Another disheartening waste of time”

This site will allow scam artists to use your phone number, basically participating in blatant identify theft, and then keep your phone number of record after the fake account has been deleted, so it will be physically impossible for you to EVER use their service. Not that you want to use their service. 

The site also allows its buyers to carry out theft, stealing the money you are entitled to for completing the work, without so much as even investigating the fraudster. This site fully allows its users to carry out fraud. I'm surprised they have not yet been sued into oblivion.

I guess this is just typical of companies based out of Israel, a non-existent country run by religious zealots and terrorists. Yet another terrible experience with yet another terrible Israel-based company.

99.99% of the services on this site are absolutely fake. The last thing i purchased on this garbage site was a logo.

10,"I've had an account on Fiverr for many years. In 2013 I disabled it because of too much problems. The support acted like Gods and deleted gigs, too many of the competition gave bad reviews and too many wanted freebies - claiming they asked for free for a good cause! 
I started a new account in 2016 or 17 and thought I would try again. No visitors only and the same show. This time I offered giant deals for a ""fiverr""! They deleted my videos, they stopped my gigs and claimed they couldn't be true. I sent proof and when I did -they claimed I had multiple accounts. No good place, they've stepped away from the indie artists and focus only on already high paid people that work beside their normal business. It's expensive for the customers and its not a deal when more brilliant artists don't get a chance. (I'm not an artist but I did offer a huge promo deal)!

16,"I've had an account for a while that has allowed me to make an extra income as a seller. Unfortunately, I ran into a scammer buyer. After providing agreed upon service, of which they highly approved, I was shocked months later when I received a notice that a refund was to me given for the jobs following a cancellation of the order. Turns out this very common and the seller ends up losing. So I followed up with their customer support. BIG MISTAKE! This people are not only unhelpful, not interested in your problem, but also have a hint of malice in them. Should you send a query and follow up on it, they'll take action - just not the one you expect. They'll find any excuse to find you in violation of their precious ""ToS"" and close down your account. Yet they had no problem with your services earlier. Awesome! Just like magic. Should you find any review complementing their CS please ignore it. It has been probably written by one of their clearly incompetent CS members. All they ever send are pre-written messages that are general and not specific. Should you push with an issue you run the risk of being shut out of fiverr. For those still on the platform, should you ever run into a problem, find an alternate way of addressing it. Else you'll have your hard earned cash locked with your account - very unfortunate. Sellers receive no protection on the platform. You are supposed to tolerate abusive clients, take orders that no longer interest you among a host of other annoying buyer habits that CS should help you solve.
Secondly, they take a huge chunk of you earnings. 20% of each coin made belongs to the platform. This is abit too much. Buyers too complain when you charge highly to compensate for the fees amount as they too pay high fees as the amount increases.

18,"Hello, my name is Anthony. I'm a 25 year old CEO with a Bachelor's Degree in Sociology and my own global music marketing company. I have been a top ranked seller on Fiverr for over 3 years with close to $70k in sales. When you type in music promotion or music blogs on Fiverr we are the top search result. My business was founded on Fiverr several years ago and I absolutely loved Fiverr. I continued to grow with this company as they evolved and all of our gigs were top rated with thousands of  five star reviews. 

Fiverr transformed my life in a multitude of ways. I have used the revenue I generated on your platform to travel around the world and pay off student loan and credit card debt. I was very surprised when my account was unexpectedly closed due to what appear to be simple misunderstandings that Fiverr does not seem to want to work with me to rectify. To add to this, Fiverr has no working phone number and the only way I was able to speak with a supervisor was by doing a lot of researching, finding the personal number of an ex-Fiverr employee, calling him at home and getting the contact info for a current employee, there whole system sucks! For a multi-BILLION dollar company you would think they would have a WORKING PHONE NUMBER, but clearly they are only concerned with cutting cost and increasing profit, a business like this is doomed to fail in the future. The owner's are simply way too greedy!!! They jacked the fees up to 20% for buyer's and seller's, meaning they keep 40% of all revenue you generate, this is insane!!! Also, when I reached out to the CEO on Twitter to try to get assistance and explain the issue, he blocked me!!!

Anyhow, back to the issue at hand here. My Fiverr account Bosshogg777 was closed about a month and a half ago due to what 'Jay' (head of Fiverr customer support) said was multiple TOS violations, which I firmly do not believe occur as depicted.
I've been a freelancer on Fiverr for over 3+ years with over $65,000 in sales. Jay mentioned my account was closed for low quality of service, mis-delivering orders, and multiple chargebacks. To clarify, I was a top ranked seller on Fiverr (#1 in music promotion) for 3+ years with over $65,000 in revenue. If we rendered low quality deliveries or mis-delivered orders, we wouldn't have an average rating of 4.9 stars and have thousands of clients, many of which are repeat clients whom we've developed personal relationships with over the course of several years. 

The only time I mis-delivered an order is when the buyer didn't provide the gig requirements in time so I simply sent him a message requesting that the buyer provide the info required so we can complete the gig. I was unaware this is a TOS violation and that you can use the resolution center to request additional time if the buyer doesn't respond or send the gig requirements in time. I didn't know where this feature was located on the site but now I see it has been included with the order. This in itself should not warrant having my account that I built up for years permanently closed. I do take responsibility for this, but in my defense this occurred one time, not multiple times and was simply due to my ignorance which is no excuse, but certainly shouldn't warrant the closure of my account.

To further expand on this, Jay said we received 25 chargebacks over the course of 3 years and he said this was solely due to poor quality of services rendered. However, I disagree with this firmly because all of these buyers left 5 star reviews and never mentioned to me or Fiverr that they had an issue with there order or wanted a refund. They engaged in deliberate and intentional fraud in attempt to get services for free. We should NOT be penalized this and there is nothing to substance the claim that the chargebacks were due to low quality of services. 

Currently, Fiverr has no system in place to protect buyers from sellers doing chargebacks because you require no in depth level of security, such as requiring a buyer to submit a copy of there driver's license or identification card to verify there identity when they sign up for an account. 

Essentially, the only ramification the buyer will face is potentially getting a warning or having there account closed. However, that doesn't suffice and they could simply sign up for a new account and do the same thing again to other sellers. This is a severe vulnerability with your site that should be addressed immediately and I certainly should not be punished for chargebacks due to fraud. In addition, 25 chargebacks on 6,000+ orders is a very LOW percentage, less then 1/2 of 1% of all orders we've completed over 3+ years. I personally do not like chargebacks and I take a loss every time this occurs but it is infrequent and I write it off as part of doing business online. I would like to work with Fiverr on implementing news ways in which we can protect buyers from chargebacks and improve the overall security of the Fiverr marketplace.

Does mis-delivering one order because the buyer didn't send the gig requirements in time and having less then 1/2 of 1% of all orders we've result in chargebacks warrant having our top ranked seller account closed? I do not understand the logic behind this decision considering my business was founded on Fiverr and we have generated a tremendous amount of revenue for Fiverr. We have excellent metrics and customer reviews and our revenue has increased greatly every year. All of our gigs have thousands of 5 star reviews, many of which are from repeat clients. We have made nearly $70,000 in sales over 3 years and this number would have continued to increase if our account wasn't closed.
Fiverr generates 40% of all revenue from buyer and seller fees. The amount of revenue I've generated for this company from my high sales should be recognized as well as all of my hard work and diligence with delivering orders on time and having excellent reviews and metrics. I do not feel like I am being treated fairly or with respect, nor do I understand why they would want to close my account rather then work with me to rectify any issues.

I do appreciate the opportunity to make a new account, which they have reluctantly allowed me to do, but starting from scratch will take years to build back what I have lost. Imagine if someone took away your whole Fiverr business and told you to go found a new company and you lost access to all your clients and revenue. This has also put me in a very bad predicament. I'm a U.S. expat living overseas and I work remotely. I depend on this income to survive. Now all of my credit cards are maxed out and I've missed multiple payments because I've had my livelihood taken away from me. I went from making $3-5k a month to $200-300. It is so bad sometimes I don't sleep at night or wonder how I will pay my rent or buy groceries. I wouldn't wish what happened to me on my worst enemy.

In addition, they are preventing me from accessing nearly $2,000 in revenue from sales I've already COMPLETED for 90 days!!! This in itself should be illegal!!!

I've taken many losses in life from watching my father pass away suddenly from a massive heart attack when I was 10 years old and having to be the man of the house and raise my younger siblings to watching my mother go through chemotherapy for breast and skin cancer and losing several family members and friends to drugs, violence, and death but I do not feel like I should be punished for simple misunderstandings that can be corrected. This whole thing has turned my world and life as I knew it upside down.

I eat, sleep and breathe Fiverr. If you look at the thousands of reviews we've accumulated on ALL of our gigs, you will see I only provided the highest quality of services, hence the thousands of positive reviews, comments, and average rating of 4.9 stars on all of our gigs. 

What they have done to me is beyond fathomable. Now I am in the process of pursuing this legally and have an attorney who will ensure they get what they deserve.

It should also be noted this company, Fiverr, and it's CEO Micha Kaufman have an F rating with the BBB as well as numerous complaints.

There is complete fraud from this seller.  I have been on Fiverr for years and no one has scammed the public more than this person.  All their supposed outlets are fake, dead twitter accounts, made up newspapers, etc.  They give live urls to what they published but it's not attached to anything real.  It is like they have these 500 fake links to something they own.  They give a link but when you go to any of their outlets it doesn't exist.  When I try to ask for the contact information to websites or news outlets they don't have any.  They have somehow managed to create a fake similar url and attach it to real live outlets.  Many of the background layouts are similar from news site to news site which is impossible.  All the still active twitter accounts all started in 2012 and look exactly alike which is impossible to be real.  I spent $183.75 which I need refunded to me immediately.

VERY BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THE CLIENT NAMED *
Hi, 
I am going to write you my very bad experience with the client named Hseaton and his current order with me on fiverr. 
The client gave me a task of JPG to HTML. When I asked him for the PSD files, he said I do not have any PSD files. These JPG files are created programmatically (I would request you to check whether the client has got these these JPGs done by other seller on Fiverr and did not pay for these. This is why the seller did not give him the PSD files). 
Further, he added you have to work on system-generated screen and I need more colour idea and design more with polished effects. I have done his task and converted JPG to responsive html but he come up with some changes. 
He wrote me this: 
""I would like for you to introduce new design to this. Please consider using different colors, shades, and perhaps shadows? Also, I need the column header, and the icons below it, to be centered. 
Also, the menu section is too wide. That should be as narrow as possible so we can use the main area to display active information."" 
I did it accordingly and shared the link with him. 
He wrote me 
""Please make this 'shadow' less dramatic, it looks like you've split the holding element in half. Just make it a little more subtle. 
If we give you ftp access to the real pages, are you able to go in and re-style this way?"" 
Just look at the cunningness and dishonestly. Although he has assigned the work on fiverr, he is telling me to do the work on his server. 
Again, he asked me to add more colours effects and shadows. I followed his instruction and I did it. 
He was very happy with the work and wrote me 
""great. please do the other screen, then we're ready to implement in the actual pages. 
Thank you!"" 
He said great work and carry on with the other screens. Cunningly, he asked me to transfer files to his server. I did not reply. Order is running and not completed yet how I will transfer all files to client server? 
I think he knows how to download the html following the link. I am sure he has done the same and stolen the work in this way. 
As soon as he was able to do this, he wrote me: 
""Actually Samaptiray, this really isn't good enough. all you have done is add some fades and gradients to the design I gave you. We are paying you $150 for more than just that. I need to see a completely different approach. Some actual design. If you cannot do that, we should cancel this job."" 
He is telling me great work and asking me complete the rest of the screens and later telling me is not good enough for the second part. Just think about the level of dishonesty and cunningness. 
Most unfortunately, the client is asking to cancel the project every time without any proper reasons. 
I have changes more than 4 times but he is always telling me to cancel the order without any proper reasons. I think client is totally a dishonest person and when he had seen the html design he download the total html file and now want to cancel the order. He got the file that he wanted. He did not say what he wants in the design. I have invested lots of time in his design and now ready to complete his order but did not get any positive response and cooperation from the client. I am requesting you kindly handle the matter carefully and help me solve it. 
Kindly follow the attachments and conversation link https://www.fiverr.com/users/samaptiray/manage_orders/FO710BE3712D4

With regards,

Hi Samapti,

I'm very sorry to see that your experience with this order has been less than positive and I completely understand where you are coming from. 

I reviewed the order, and I see that you've followed up with the buyer to advise on the revisions made and that they are yet to be responded as they got back to you.

We cannot force your buyer to accept the order if they have issues with it, so you will need to persuade the buyer to accept your work, or negotiate for an agreement with your buyer.

May I recommend that you draw up a list for the buyer, showing that your work has been fully completed in accordance to their initial work requirements, and let us know how the buyer responds?

Please follow up with us in the next 24 to 48 hours with any changes or updates on this.

Warm regards,

Hi,

Thank you very much for your response and valuable advice on it.

I am highly interested in completing the order. Only for this reason, I have done the work more than four times and made several changes according to his needs and guidance. However, I am receiving no positive approach, attempt and co-operation on behalf of the client. He is more interested in canceling the project without any proper reason. In spite of my relentless efforts and requests to write me the design idea what he has in his mind and some samples that he likes the most, he is sharing nothing with me and sticking to his point, ""please cancel the project"".

He sent me a cancellation request, writing me this

""I think we do not have agreement on what I need, and it is better to cancel early than continue. The layouts you sent are just copies of our designs - adding purple was not a reasonable solution, it shows that we are just not a good match. Please accept this cancellation and spend time with customers who are more suited to your design style. thank you.""

When I am asking him why cancellation- I have done the job exactly as you instructed and you got changes done by me more than 4 times until it fitted his needs, he could not explain the reason why he needs cancellation.

The matter of fact is that he got changes several times until he met his requirement.

This is why he wrote me

""great. please do the other screen, then we're ready to implement in the actual pages.

Thank you!""

I am sure his requirement has been fulfilled and he got html code from from the link that I shared with him. He has downloaded it and copied codes from the view sources. This is why why he is desperate to cancel his order.

He did not explain why he needs cancellation.Till now I am ready to do work on the order but he is not telling me what he actually wants. 
When I have asked him, ""What do you want?"" What design layout in your mind tell me I am ready to do that because we are professional. But the Client is insisting me to cancel the order.

Please take some initiatives so that the client cannot go with the work without paying nothing for it. Please think about my hard labor for it.

We are here in fiverr to complete an order. However, it is not possible if a client has any bad intention in him.

If a client is an honest person and he cooperates us, we can defiantly deliver him a satisfactory work.

With thanks, 
Samapti

Hello Samapti,

I completely understand your frustration because you have delivered what you promised in your Gig description. As you mention in your email, you have dedicated time and hard work in this order.

I would strongly suggest that you try to reach an agreement with your buyer regarding this order and explain to the buyer what you have done and the revisions that you have made.

Please let me know how things work out.

Kind regards

Hi,

Thanks for your suggestion and very good advice. 
Please follow the conversation link 
https://www.fiverr.com/users/samaptiray/manage_orders/FO710BE3712D4 
The client got several changes done until it fulfill his requirements exactly and wrote me 
""great. please do the other screen, then we're ready to implement in the actual pages"" 
After that, he stole all html part by downloading and copying code from the view source. 
Only to get the work free, he does not want to pay me anything. He is a professional scammer. This is why he does not want to reach an agreement. 
This is why he wrote me this 
""I sent you ideas of how we might design, as you asked. 
I don't care how hard you say you worked, this looks identical to what we gave you, except some color changes. I will not pay for this.""

With thanks,

Hi,

The client is sending me unnecessary revisions without any proper reasons and without giving me the design idea that he has he in his mind and sending me sample that he likes now even after getting the work done more than 4 times.

Please follow the previous messages, I have already done the work more than 4 times until it meets his needs exactly.

Else he did not write me this

""hseaton 
hseaton 
great. please do the other screen, then we're ready to implement in the actual pages.

Thank you!

21:53September 10, 2018""

I have written him this

you liked my work and approved it 
""great. please do the other screen, then we're ready to implement in the actual pages"". 
and finally asked me to it to your server

""are you able to go in and re-style this way?""

Unless you approved the work and liked it, you would never write me

great. please do the other screen, then we're ready to implement in the actual pages"". 
and 
""are you able to go in and re-style this way?""

Hello again, 

I understand this can be frustrating, however, I do need to ask you to keep this professional, it is not ok to threaten the buyer with their websites or doing religious comments as this will not help the situation.

We are not able to force a buyer into accepting an order they are not satisfied with, I strongly suggest that you try to reach an agreement with your buyer regarding this order and explain to the buyer what you have done and the revisions that you have made.

Hi *,

I have already told you that I have tired but failed to reach an agreement. 
On 19:50September 13, 2018, he wrote me, ""I am not paying for this.""

This is why I am requesting if you can motivate him to reach an agreement with me that will be better.

I am not threatening him, I am telling him to be honest and not to steal other's labor.

In comparison to * your reply message is very unfortunate and frustrating as well. I would request you to read the previous messages and the replies from the other customer case executives. I hope you can understand the reason of frustration.

* (customer support executive) wrote me

Hi,

This is to bring to your attention that as the order no FO710BE3712D4 has been canceled by Firverr team. All my efforts and labors have gone to ashtray. What I have received as the reward of my hard labor is only a negative freed back.

Follow this link 
https://www.fiverr.com/users/samaptiray/manage_orders/FO710BE3712D4

As I have received no money for the work and the order has been canceled by the fiverr team itself, I think it is very illogical and unethical to keep the feedback of the client.

Please follow the attachment to know how I have suffered and received only a negative feedback as reward of my hard work.

This is why my earnest entreaty to you please remove the feedback of the canceled order. Else I have to leave fiverr permanently with this very bad experience.

With great regret, 
Samapti

Hi,

Either give me the money for the work or remove the feedback.

Previously, I did not believe these reviews given below:

https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/fiverr.com 
https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.fiverr.com

Now, I believe these are the honest reviews. These are real reflections of their agonies and their true confessions of being robbed.

Hi,

How unfortunate and no-cooperative you are. You have helped the buyer to steal the work and taken full responsibility to cancel the work. however, you cannot take the responsibility of feedback removal. As the order is canceled and I have not received the money for the work then why this review.

Are you joking with me?

Hello again Samapti,

We are truly sorry to hear that you feel this way, however, the review that has been left for this order was an honest review of the experience this buyer had with you. We are unable to remove such reviews, even if the order gets cancelled.

In Customer Support it is our role to remain neutral, and we are unable to take the side of the buyer or the seller in cases where there are no violations of our Terms of Service.

I can see that you have replied to the feedback publicly, so that prospective buyers can see your side of the story, and how you handled this situation as well. Please remember that it is not always possible to please every buyer.

Hi,

This is my humble request to you as Fiverr team took the full initiative to cancel the order, it is their moral duty to remove the feedback. Else I cannot help leaving Fiverr permanently with a bitter experience and sharing my experiences with others.

Just think my work has been stolen 
Fiverr has canceled the work

What I have received is only the negative review for my hard labor. Just think how injustice is this.

Hi again Samapti,

Please note that this case has been reviewed multiple times and the feedback will not be removed from your order. No one is more sorry than the Fiverr team when the feedback a user receives is disappointing. Sometimes, despite our best efforts, we fall short of meeting a user's expectations. 

That said, we rarely remove the feedback a user provides us. It is one person's opinion, and yes, it can be subjective, but it is in fact the way that user feels.

While we wish we had better news, we hope you will continue to produce excellent work.

We are now penalized for not responding to messages that Fiverr has deemed as spam. We are now penalized for cancelled orders even though the buyers don't provide the information to complete orders. We are now stripped of our Level after years of working to achieve it but brand new sellers can come in, make one sale, and become a Level 2. It's absurd how far Fiverr has gone downhill. Support is lacking and you may work hard but they don't care.",1,“Hard work is stripped from Sellers” 
36,"This purports to be a clearinghouse for entrepreneurs. I am sure that is like herding cats. Nevertheless, you can do that honorably or otherwise. The site is almost hermetically sealed. You cannot get support unless you dodge and weave among the allowed options. A PROPOSED gig, sent to be reviewed by the great and powerful FIVE, if it fails to meet spec, GAINS  YOU YOUR ACCOUNT DISABLED AND A WARNING OF BANISHMENT. You would think these guys are standing at the gate, fending off the barbarians from the very doors of righteousness. The responses I got were superficial, having never read my complaint to begin with. Arrogance on a stick",1,“If I could give a zero I would” 
37,"Fiverr seems to be only interested in getting money from buyers and sellers.

As a buyer, I contacted a seller to design a logo for my startup. The seller didn't even understand my requirements and come up with another concept entirely which I complained about to, he changed it, but insisted I completed the order before sending me the source file, which was not the agreement. I feel cheated and manipulated, but anyway I had to comply, due fiverr CS nonchalant attitude ( in the past, when I contact them, they will just reply with a premade sentence, without analyzing and investigating your complaints).

Sellers, can cancel works done for him, no question asked, without even complaining to me, Fiverr just cancels it without contacting me. As a digital marketer, some variables are relative to this success of any marketing campaign, from budget to time to begin to see results, some buyers are short-sighted and want instant results which attimes doesn't work that way.

And then again, Fiverr ever-changing policies, sellers are just being treated on the platform, like a slave. Today, 12/09/18, they roll out a policy just to favor sellers a little bit, shame on them, after a long time of torture by fiverr on sellers.",1,"“One sided site, with no ethics” "
38,"A lot of sellers on Fiverr are selling stolen copyrighted materials like videos, logos, etc.
Fiverr knows that very well and they are partners with those thieves. If you open a ticket, they will ignore it and close it. They simply don't care. They care only how to collect money in any way. no ethics or morals. Fiverr are a bunch of thieves and most of their sellers.",1,“Copyright violations” 
39,"The terms and conditions you are following is not up to the mark. I did not violate the term and conditions. Buyer did not read my gig description that s not my fault. But fiverr supported him.  And 2nd buyer did not come for 15 days online or did response to me, again that was not my mistake , I was asking him question regarding gig but he did not reply. then with the help of fiverr support again they blamed on me.

I'm an event planner we have constantly events and invitations and things that need to be done one day I gave him 12  jobs at once BOOM he completed them QUICK! i ended  the Giggs the designer sent me the work I sent a review we thought everything was okay.  a few days later I get an email from customer service stating that they're going to close my account and his to. WHAT! Not only that they closed my account but they snatched all the money I paid the designer away from him and kept it now that's shady!  When I inbox them and ask them what the problem was they refuse to answer so I responded back again with the stronger message then they blocked me REALLY.  Their customer service sucks WHEN you question them they will block you.  the part that sucks even more I spent two years Gathering all of the people I was working with when they deleted my account I had no access to all the work I had already paid for I had no access to my vendors that I was working with if you do choose to work with these people make sure you keep your contacts because when they delete you lose all your information.

After two weeks, I finally gave up and hired a designer in the USA.  I paid in advance, only received about a third of the work that I paid for, and Fiverr would not do a blasted thing about it.  They don't care.  They just want to shut you up.  I only lost $110, but far worse was seeing a company turn a blind eye to doing the right thing.  They could have, but they chose not to.  Stay away from these theives.",1,“FIVERR DOESN'T HAVE ANY STANDARDS” 
42,"So we are a class undergoing training for a Virtual Assistance course.  We're required to sign up and set up an account at Fiverr.  We all made an account that day.  The next day we had our accounts disabled.  Ok, fine... I email their customer care to explain the situation.  I figured they might have suspected us for bots.  I explained, provided proof, provided links to government-sponsored programs, and provided pictures of our school, students and trainers.  They didn't explain which specifically of the ToS we violated, they didn't suggest ways to help us, and they didn't offer to help us.  Instead, they were in a hurry to terminate communication without further input in their end.",1,“Customer Care Don't Care”

Heres the process just so you understand:
Contact the seller about the task you need done
The seller agrees they can complete the task no problem
The seller sends you an offer which you gladly accept so they can get working on the task
The seller delivers the order
Once the order is delivered then you MUST accept the order before they send you the edit files
Once you accept the order then you get the edit files to send to the supplier
Once you accept the order you are directed to leave a review about the seller and asked to leave a TIP

Now you have all you need to send the file to the supplier. If there are any issues with the file then you have to contact the seller AGAIN and ask them to fix the issues they did . GOOD LUCK on getting the seller to reply or even fix the mess up they made.

they never help seller, they treat seller like nothing, they think seller is there servant, but they never thought its because of seller's good quality and hard work they are doing there business.

They  have very bad policies regarding the seller. 

If seller have enemy in real life and if he complaint on fiverr that he is my enemy fiverr will close the seller account.

They are giving 100% support only to the buyers not to the sellers.

Buyer can do anything to the seller, he can take work from the seller. and then ask easily for refund and post negative feedback.

Fiverr seller is giving 20% of the order to the fiverr and other payment transfer deduction but seller is not secure at all.

If i hate any seller i can make a new account as a buyer and make a order to the seller then i will contact fiverr $#*! team they will close the seller account for no reason.

if buyer is drunk he will abuse seller and post negative review without any reason and fiverr support team never help the seller to sort of the feedback issue.

Now fiverr introduce new system on ever month they check seller performance if the performance is below 90% is down they  are removing his badges. BUT WHY?

If you cancellation system is weak and bad, if you dont give rights and power to the seller and you don't have solid agreements while creating order. then why are you removing badges.

Buyer can order and he can ask refund even just minutes after order if he change his mind here seller have to pay him back and cancel the order at the same time but fiverr  downs the sellers order completion ratings which is 100% BAD thing on fiverr.

MY MESSAGE IS FOR FIVERR SUPPORT TEAM. BUYERS ARE KING BUT IT DOES MEAN SELLERS ARE THEIR SERVANT, SHOW SOME RESPECT TOWARDS SELLERS.

STOP NOW GIVING MORE IMPORTANCE TO THE BUYER AS SOME BUYERS ARE GREEDY AND BAD MINDED PEOPLE.

MAKE YOUR WEBSITE AND POLICY PROFESSIONAL DONT THINK FOR YOUR BENEFITS. AS YOU KNOW IF BUYER CANCEL THE ORDER FROM ONE SELLER HE WILL USE SERVICE FROM OTHER SELLER SO IN ALL WAYS ITS YOU GUYS WIN WIN GAME.

54,"This company is a complete joke. A bunch of scam artists. I used them a few times in the past but today I had a seller that did an exceptional job and so I decided to give him a $5 tip. 

Of course we all know that there is a $2 service fee on purchases. How do we know? Because it shows the $2 service fee on the order page! Logical right. You can't charge somebody a fee that they don't know about and are not shown on some sort of order/confirmation page. That's kind of...um...illegal. 

So I go to give this guy a $5 tip, click all the way though (the confirmation page looks exactly like the original order page...except NO SERVICE CHARGE ANYWHERE TO BE FOUND). Then you click, they charge your credit card and the next page comes up, showing you the total price for the service, plus the ""tip"". In that total price is ANOTHER $2 service charge that was included in the tip charge but never shown to the user. Of course the strategy of this pathetic company is that nobody will bother to do the math when that page comes up (WHY ARE YOU SHOWING ME A SUMMED TOTAL WITH THE INITIAL PURCHASE PRICE AS A CONFIRMATION PAGE FOR THE TIP I JUST MADE?!). 

I send an email to get my $2 back and this guy has the nerve to attach the terms and conditions, which shows that a $2 service fee is payable on any PURCHASE up to $40. A tip is, by definition, not a purchase jack@$$ but nice try. 

This is so obviously a deliberate scam. Reeks of a desperate startup looking to inflate revenue. Must be looking to ipo this crap company so they can cash out as the ""customers"" leave en masse. Leave this mess of a company for the unsuspecting shareholders.

1. Fiverr defaults to giving you site credit instead of refunding to payment method, even though the situation is not at all the buyer's fault

2. Fiverr does not refund the service fee portion of that order if your site balance is automatically applied to your next order (at which point you have to pay the service fee again, no less)

I contacted Fiverr to remove the review because it was not my fault in anyway whatsoever, and they said ""they will not remove the review because the buyer canceled the order"" I was like, eh? That doesn't make any sense whatsoever and why do I deserve a -1star review for that reason when myself and the buyer had done nothing wrong here; it doesn't make any sense, and I was left really confused at this policy? I contacted them one time to share my feelings about this policy and asked them if they agreed with me and I could not get any answer for that, which was very laughable because we all know deep down that they know I am right here.

A buyer places an order with you, makes payment for the order, which is held in escrow by fiverr until you complete and deliver the order, and once accepted as complete by the buyer (or after 3 days if buyers do not respond, and plenty do not), fiverr clears the payment to you, but you need to wait a whopping 14 days to have access to your funds.

If you look at the gigs and people featured on the front page of fiverr now, you'll notice the vast majority of them (including myself) are showing up as ""new sellers"" whilst a year or two ago, most would be level 2's with a few ""Top Rated Sellers"", and that's despite many of them (including myself) having been with fiverr for years (I started in 2010).

FIverr do absolutely nothing to help and encourage its sellers to upscale and grow their businesses. In fact they do exactly the opposite, by changing rules that directly impact your earnings, implement systems such as the new ranking system, over which you have absolutely no control over.

If you look at my fiverr page - www.fiverr.com/activerog - been with fiverr since 2010, earnt near $20'000 so far, although the income is now diminishing as a result of fiverr's seller ranking system which is nothing short of bizarre.

In short, fiverr is the only place I've ever heard of where you can work hard, respond quickly to buyer enquiries, deliver quality work on-time all the time, and get review after review that's 5.0, with the occasional 4.9 star reviews like these :   (note the common thread, QUICK delivery, QUICK response).

* Very quick to respond, gave me exactly what I wanted and kept it quick and simple. Would recommend!

* Fast service. Ordered before I went to bed and woke up with it complete! Used for an intro to an escape room type lesson for my class. My students are going to love it!

* Simple and fast

* I bought this for a meme video. I'm very happy with the result! Rog created this very quickly and exactly as specified.

* Rog is the king. Delivers 100% accuracy every time, and extremely quick. True professional and top lad.

I was starting out running my own Adwords banner and buying ad space on meme and gaming sites to promote some of my more funny and novelty gigs and to boost my business volume and build my ranking and reviews.

I work in sales and marketing as a marketing consultant to local businesses, and I stress that customer satisfaction is absolutely paramount, they must perceive good value for money, and they must simplify and streamline their business operations to ensure they always deliver on-time.

My fiverr business model is very simple, first thing in the morning, I answer all inbound messages, check my notifications, bring up the jobs to be done and complete them, and if during the day any express orders come in, I shoot them at night, then also check messages and notifications before calling it a night.

This has been my daily business routine except on holiday mode, and as a result, buyers are initially quite surprised as to the speed of delivery of my orders, hence constant raving good reviews.

You'd think fiverr would be right behind me, considering that of every $5 I earn, they take a whopping $1 !?!?!?

I invested heavily back into my fiverr business with new LED lighting and semi-professional 4K camera equipment, a $329 Rode noise cancelling, studio microphone, when I reached ""Top Level Seller"" status. I thought I'd springboard this business, as incoming orders were on the increase after I invested in some more banner advertising to promote my gigs (remember, I'm doing the advertising and promoting whilst fiverr is taking $1 out of every $5 I earn, whilst scheming ways to screw their sellers)...

Which they did, by finishing and disallowing the category ""Testimonials & Reviews by Actors"", and my income and revenue dropped some 20-25%. Stupid idiots at fiverr aren't realising that I get people asking me in messages ""hey do you do testimonials"", and I say yes, of course. It's just fiverr has removed that category.

Without those gigs, my revenue dropped, and I was no longer meeting the requirements to be a ""Top Rated Seller"" anyway. I'm not even sure if that means anything different to being a level 2, you're still being stung for $1 for every $5 you earn, looks cool having that top rated badge though.

Anyways, back to Level 2, and I keep doing the same thing. Shooting videos once or twice a day, responding to messages twice a day, and often in-between using the app, responding quickly, delivering on-time, 100% and getting the reviews to back this up.

Another month passes, no response from customer support, and I'm demoted to Level 1.

Now I'm ""No Level"" - just like a new person that's just signing up as a seller for the very first time, what's really bizarre and weird is when you look at my fiverr gigs, even though I'm a ""New Seller"", you can see thousands of 5.0 star reviews, the odd 4.9, and one review after another raving on about how great this guy is, how he responds so quickly, delivers fast, always on-time, and total satisfaction.

It's a similar scenario with other demoted sellers, I don't know what fiverr is trying to achieve on its fiverr.com front page where some gigs are shown and featured. Now it's primarly 'new sellers', most of whom have been here for years, previously being Level 2 and TRS's, now cut back to size with a 7 gigs (services offered) limit (limiting income potential)

All I can say is that it's clear to see fiverr is run by a bunch of complete morons who have absolutely no idea how to grow a business, instead doing precisely the opposite, by complicating things, screwing things around, directly impacting the income of its sellers (and in turn also declining THEIR revenue inflows)

bizarre!  like i said in the beginning, you're not running your own business by being on fiverr.  Now I run a t-shirt business on-line on www.tkshirts.tk - that's running my own business, because nobody can change the rules to reduce my income, my website, my marketing, I actually get some marketing support from PayPal. Fiverr gives the website and app, and the whole thing works well, but until about a year ago, it has becoming more difficult and expensive (as far as my banner ad spend, promoting my gigs), and I haven't done any external advertising for my fiverr gigs aside from my own facebook and instagram pages. Before I'd be earning $400+ per month on fiverr, spending $70 to $100 on google and facebook ads promoting my fiverr services, and getting quite a few click-throughs, fiverr should be supportive towards its active and longest-serving members such as myself, not continually mess things up and make it harder and harder to earn a quid.",1,“New Rating System makes it impossible to grow your fiverr business now.” 
116,"Fiverr has had a SERIES of changes over the years... been with them for 4 years now. However they've implemented a new system that will negatively affect all sellers (unless you're processing quite a few orders daily). 

For 2018 they've started a new MONTHLY REVIEW of your account activity and they check everything from sales, response time, reviews, income etc. So if  you're not making up to the standard they set in sales your account would be automatically demoted and subsequently have to remove any gigs to fit into the new lower category. 

I've been Level 2 since maybe 2 months after joining (cant get to Top Seller because that too is controlled manually by Fiverr and they ""know"" who they want and don't) and have well over 200 FIVE STAR reviews. During the last month I received 2 negative reviews not because of poor service but because both customers requested an addition which I couldn't physically perform. So because of something as simple as this they also downgrade your account. 

So if you have a perfect record or if you're late with replying to messages, cancel gigs or just don't make enough you can go right back to the beginning as a ""NEW SELLER"".

I asked them directly about this and they've indicated that's just how the system is and basically it's up to you to maintain it. Oh and it's basically  quite OK for you or your competitors to order gigs and leave negative reviews to get them downgraded too. 

I'm sure this new monthly review was just a way for them to push sellers to make more money so FIVERR in turn would have a higher profit... however they failed to realize SIMPLE LOGIC... that if they keep demoting sellers (1) the same sellers would get less sales at a lower level than before and with less gigs, and (2) sellers would seek alternate freelancer site. 

PeoplePerHour for instance has a similar rating program BUT they DON'T downgrade sellers and they DON'T reduce your number of hourlies (gigs).

This behavior can lead to the suspension or expulsion of students. Fiverr does not allow taking part in such fraudulent activities"".

Instead of making unfounded/ridiculous assertions, this staff member should familiarize himself with what IELTS writing preparation really is or ask someone else with half a brain to explain him what it is. 
The essays written in preparation for the exam are written on random topics and cannot be submitted. At not stage, an essay is written for the student to be submitted as their own, as there is no submission of essays. The students are to be in person at the Exam Centre on the day they are undertaking the exam. The exam centers do not let them know what topic they will be covering on the day. Consultation of materials is strictly forbidden on the day of the exam. There is no fraudulent behaviour on anyone's part as my gig was to correct their written essays, marked them and provide them feedback so that students can improve their knowledge of essay structure and understanding of the marking criteria before their real exam takes place. I don't admit that Fiverr, or anyone else, make defamatory statements on my character, given that I am not doing what they claim I am doing.

Plus, if you edit your gig, if someone in the office doesn't view your edits and release your gig, it won't show in the searches until you tell them to release it. This has happened to me so many times I can't count.
It seems that if you criticise admin, they do nasty things to stop you from earning money through fiverr. The admin are young upstarts who couldn't provide customer service if their life depended on it. Fiverr admin sucks.

133,"We have now tried to get our web site built 2 different times - using ""5 star rated sellers"". 

It has been a nightmare both times.  They don't follow simple instructions (including images, a design doc, and reference site and URLS). 

There is no attention to detail or quality.  Over and over, you will need to have to ask over and over- ""center the formatting on that button"".  It will usually take 3-5 times before it gets done.  Fun, right?

All these web sellers really want to do is just install a default theme and default site, change a few labels, install a plug-in or two and then think that they are done. 

Once the deadline starts approaching they will constantly submit their work as complete and ask you to accept it and they will ""give you revisions after"".  Sorry but I wasn't born yesterday. 

This is also a violation of Fiverr policies but Fiverr doesn't seem to care.  I have a ticket open with them right now for this guy: https://www.fiverr.com/ahmed_islam

He literally wrote that he wouldn't work on it any more, insulted me, continues to submit his work as complete, and didn't complete the written terms of his gig. 

The best way to know that the Seller isn't paying any attention or understanding you is they will simply respond with ""ok"" or ""sure"".  It's a guarantee that they didn't bother to read what you wrote and won't pay any attention to quality. 

The Fiverr review system is a total scam. You can only leave feedback if you fully pay for a job - regardless of how bad the work is - or if the seller fulfilled their obligations!

This particular review is based on the logo design. To be fair, I did not purchase any of their so-called ""vetted"" sellers that they call PRO sellers. These are apparently professionals they hired from all over the world. They charge in the thousands. I don't trust their vetting process and didn't want to spend that much money to discover yet more stolen or mediocre work because of all the bad experiences.

I have spent as high as $150. When I paid the lowest price of $5, I received clip art - okay, that's fair, I get what I paid for - right? No, not exactly, it was downloaded probably from Google.  I could have done that myself without paying anyone $6 (there is a $1 processing fee tacked on) and waiting two days. That seller had no legal right to sell me something he does not own. This happened to me 3 times for logos I bought from low as $5 to high as $25.

When I spent the higher price based on really good description on their gig page, it was the same result. It wasn't stolen stuff they gave me but the work was awful, communication was even worse. The only time they seem to send me messages was when they wanted more money. If I pay them, they disappear until they deliver at the last minute. 

The products I received were below average all across the board from everyone I bought from. They only care about getting 5 star reviews and getting as much money from you as possible.

Shortly after opening an account with Fiverr, I was harassed by one of their members, listed on their account as in Australia (but claimed not to be) who, by making highly inappropriate, provocative and deliberately offensive remarks, seemed to want to highlight that he/she was better than me.

  I could not help but feel that for the work that was being offered on the site, truly professional work*, the sellers were not asking much at all. People, hear me out... YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR...  Yet after the cancellation, I had to GO IN again, and request a refund to my Credit Card, from the Customer Support. (Go back and read that again.)  That would be like returning something to Walmart, (who entertains FAR MORE clients on a daily basis - and has a QUICK refunding process) and the Customer Service people telling you, ""Oh, well to get your money back for this DEFECTIVE product, you have to go behind the store and talk to the Great Oz, who sits behind a Curtain.""

The reason is a vast majority of Fiverr clients are their own guys who bring lower cost projects from their local markets and post those on Fiverr.

As the consequence of it, they receive negative reviews in many cases. Now if their profiles show the negative reviews posted by the sellers, they will never get any seller in future to get their works done for free.

On the other hand, as the sellers profiles display the reviews, they deliver the work for free in the most of the cases. This is only to avoid the negative feedbacks and keep their profile neat and clean.

166,"At first I thought Fiverr was a great way to earn extra cash, until I started realizing the many frustrations that come from being a freelancer on Fiverr. First, they take 20% of all your proceeds (which is a lot considering the low prices sellers make). I understand that they need to make money but then they take 20% of your hard earned tips! I have received hundreds of dollars of tips and instead of getting to keep 100%, they take credit for sellers going above and beyond! Next, they charge money for you to just withdraw your earnings. If you try to inquire about anything, their customer support is a joke and they never adequately resolve any issue you bring to them. Second, if you are on vacation (and in some cases do not even have internet access), sellers can still contact you if they are past clients and if you don't respond then your response time gets lowered and buyers are less likely to choose your services. Third, and most frustrating, Fiverr can delete your gigs for absolutely no reason without even discussing it with you first. I had a gig up for 1 whole year, received a fair amount of work and a large amount of money from it (which also means Fiverr received a good amount of money as well), had all 5 star reviews, and Fiverr removed the gig without any warning and just said it was a violation. There are 150 other gigs just like mine but somehow they aren't violations. There is no trust with Fiverr and I don't believe they have seller's interests at heart. They favor the buyer over the seller and treat their sellers like garbage. They don't try to keep their sellers happy and I guarantee they have lost a lot of good sellers because of it.

My repeated requests for assistance from Fiverr were ignored. Whats laughable is that Fiverr swiftly disabled my account after I filed a dispute with PayPal for violating Fiverrs Terms of Service.

They are in so badly need of money and job that if they are allowed to get money of the 30% work done for their clients, they will stick to this platform.

This is why buyers profiles do not show reviews. Therefore, the sellers cannot understand the buyers who have already scammed many sellers. 
On the contrary, sellers profiles show the reviews (posted by the buyers) to help the buyers easily understand a good seller.

For sellers:
I was with Fiverr since the very beginning (where it was still cool) until my account was disabled for no reason a couple of weeks ago. Sellers beware, your account is at risk at any time, the support does not give a sh** about you and since this ""company"" sits somewhere in Isreal it's nearly impossible to take legal action (not that it would be worth the hassle anyway). To make things even better, all funds on your (for no reason) disabled account are frozen for 90 days and I highly doubt I will see any of that money ever again, even if the 90 days have passed. DO NOT SELL here. You can't make decent profits anyway, because Fiverr is swamped with sellers from 3rd world countries who can throw parties for their whole village once they earn five bucks (four that is after 20% fees). If you are in a western country, you do not want to compete against them, trust me. You're better off working minimum wage for Mc Donalds. They do at least not take 20% fees of your minimum wage, like Fiverr does.

Why Fiverr is scam
i)	Fiver is headquartered in Israel (12 HaOmanim St.  Tel Aviv, Gush Dan 6789731, Israel) which has no state and obviously the state Attorney General to complaint about the cheating and scamming practices of the fiverr people. Taking this opportunity, a group of American scammers have founded it in Israel.

ii)	Fiverr has no rating display system for the buyers. This is why they dont bother a bit about picking up an artificial quarrel with the buyers to get their work done for free. If you complaint to their customer support department, they will tell you to discuss with your buyer and settle the matter. At last they will cancel the job and allow the buyers to go away, taking their commission for the work.   

iii)	Take a close look at each job posted on fiverr, you will find that a vast majority of these jobs are fake posting to create an impression that it is a very popular freelancing platform.

iv)	Dont do bulk work on fiverr. When you do bulk work on fiverr, a buyer (may be a fiverr people) will approach you with a tantalizing offer. When you get started with it, he/she will pick up a fresh quarrel and inform the matter to the fiverr team. Fiverr team will make your withdrawal option null or disable and at last Fiverr will cancel your profile when all payment get cleared.   

v)	In spite of doing all works perfectly (A-Z), buyer and fiverr team can cancel the work with no proper reason and explanation. In that case, you will not receive the money for the work but get a negative review on behalf of the buyer.  

vi)	Even after a longer period of time, any buyer (for whom you have worked) can express dissatisfaction about a work and the amount paid for the work will be deducted from your account. If you dont have any balance in your account, your account will show (-) minus balance. 

Besides, there are so many disadvantages for the sellers. Fiverr is always against the sellers. Just do work on it and let me know- if anything proves wrong.",1,“Sellers! Be Aware! Fiverr is a complete scam”

206,"I worked on fiverr for more than 1 year and believe me, it's not worth it
You can earn some money, that is true, but many times it's not worth the hours invested
This depends where you are coming from, it's profitable for people living in very poor countries where 10-15$ dollars is called a payday
But as tempting as it seems to pay 5-10$ for services, don't bring your hopes up, because Fiverr is full of so called ''professionals'', when in reality most of them are indians with little to no skills at all

So keep in mind when ordering on fiverr that at the end of the day you receive what you paid for, which might be low quality or stolen work 
 I'm working on multiple platforms as a freelancer and can tell you that working on fiverr was the worst experience so far

So you can get a more in depth perspective of my personal experience
As a seller:On this platform everybody is expecting high end professional services for 5$ or even for free
This comes from an animator/illustrator who had more than 150 orders in a period of a year or so

As a buyer: Most of the sellers are scammers, stealing work and re-selling the same product over and over again

Customer service is pretty useless as well
Fiverr is aware of all the bull$#*! that is happening on their platform, but they don't give a damn as long as they are making money
Their promotion attracts mostly cheap ass customers that believe that anything above 5$ is too expensive and outrageous, putting pressure on sellers to lower their prices while providing good services 
People will try to take advantage of you and even get work for free,or in case you are a buyer, they will try to get away with your money

I had good and bad clients, mostly bad 

I stopped working on this platform because by doing so, i was promoting a company of thieves and scammers
Also remember that fiverr is taking 20% from your total earnings",1,“Total Crap” 
207,"If you are a potential buyer assume the following:

4. An expertise claimed is absent.
5. A country in which the seller lives e.g. USA is fake.
If after having considered the above you are still interested then:
1. Pay only by Paypal.
2. Get ready on the delivery date to access the Resolution Centre and ask for a refund.
3. If Fiverr offers you a credit write to Fiverr support and demand a full refund of all moneys including processing fee to be refunded to your Paypal Account.

(He is likely using several avatars to promote his (non-existent) expertise.) You never get to know whether they have provided the services as promised. And what a great idea: The review of their work must be provided at the moment they say your order is completed. This basically means that the seller created the ad. The ad has not been distributed, nor do you know how it performed. Of course you are so excited about being helped quickly that you give the sellers the best reviews. But after that, nothing happens. You see no results. Now you are out of your money, and the Fiverr sellers are protected because they say they performed what they promised. They can't lose on this business model.

280,"Gosh! These are really some bad reviews that I was not expecting. However this means I am not alone. Now my experience... 

The so-called ""top class logo designer with 5 years experiences"" first started off with a very friendly ""customer service"" and emphasized on providing 100% satisfaction and to hint that it has to be a 5-star review that should be given once the case gets closed. Yet at one point in the beginning, he even closed the case without any mutual agreement. I guess he simply wanted to a NICE record of a fast turnaround. However the first draft looked more that an ENHANCED internet image with the company name. We were expecting, well, more than that quality of course, given the ""impressive profile introduction"" that the designer claimed to be. Naturally we would want changes. We had even added on the changes fee of USD20. Now with the designer's attitude changed completely citing that it is not fair to him to incorporate the color changes and we need to add on another payment. If there was a clear communication right from the start to limit the number of changes, we will gladly abide. But there was nothing said. Sad to say, it feels like being SCAMMED.

Now, the designer simply closed the case without our agreement. At the end of the day, he only wants to have the 5-stars reviews published on his profile. This is a dirty trick.

I guess there could be genuine designers out there in Fiverr doing REAL PROFESSIONAL work, but it really depends on your luck on who you have picked. With this bad experience, we will NOT be back on Fiverr again. My thoughts, unless you have a real recommendation of a good designer on Fiverr, do not go there and instead go for real professionals and pay a few more bucks to get the value of the work. After all, it's the ARTWORK of your company brand. Do it well.

My lesson learned. I wished I'd known better, earlier.

I contacted Fiverr customer support to cancel the project and give put the deposit order of $130.00 back into my account. They told me that I need to work with the designer. My dislike for how the project was going should have been enough to give me a refund. I then told the designer that I did not like his design and I wanted to cancel service but refused the cancellation. I once more contacted Fiverr customer service to get my refund and again they told me the same information, to work with the individual. I refused and Fiverr proceeded to give the person the $130.00 when I told them I was having issues with the project. Terrible service especially when the  issues was not even resolved.

282,Designers refuse to listen to what you want. Most of them are teams of people and each revision is done by a different person. They apparently refuse to look at all the communication up to that point so they don't deliver what you want.

287,"Just FYI, this is May 4, 2017. I've had 3 encounters with fiverr freelancers and 2 of them were HORRIBLE. 'Genuinely horrible. I worked with a very immature translator who questioned me on why I gave him 4 instead of 5 stars. It was as though I had to defend myself. He also EXPECTED a tip, which (of course) disinclined me in doing so. He had numerous mistakes in his translation, didn't deliver my file in the format I had asked for, and then questioned my rating of him. I was actually being GENEROUS in giving him 4 stars. 

Then I worked with a designer who was taking my layout, my choice of font, my text, and simply creating a business card in a format that would be print company-friendly. At first, I got a zip file that--when I downloaded it--was identified by my machine as an iTunes file!!!!!!!!!!!! Later, when I received corrected files, I sent them to Moo (an online printer), to have them look at them. They had the ""fiverr"" watermark in them! And, on closer inspection, I noticed that a logo was horizontal on the front of the card, and vertical on the back side. Spacing of the entire text and logo on the back was off, as was spacing between the logo and a line of text. 

HERE'S THE KICKER. I offered the so-called designer an out, and she took it. She ""refunded"" my $70. But--and it's a huge but--I don't actually get that money back!!!!! It goes into my ""account,"" to use for future projects, with this company that I've grown to hate. 

So there you have it. Oh--they're located in Israel, so you can't contact a state's attorney general, say. I will write some letters, though. A payment to a designer, with a refund, SHOULD be a refund to ME, of my hard-earned money.

The seller then held my images hostage because I did not give him a perfect 5 stars in all categories (have screenshot), Fiverr cancelled my account in the middle of other gigs (email messages) I have going on. They did not refund me for 2 of the projects that were ongoing. I did not violate the terms and conditions I STATED the options I had for recovery. Fiverr didn't like the fact that I kept pressing the issue to get my money back so now they are retaliating against me.

I have a screenshot where I was told, by the Fiverr customer service, that filing a dispute was against the terms (I have screenshot of the seller filing the initial dispute)and then Fiverr deactivated my account in middle of a website being built and an image design. Fiverr has bullied me after I was bullied by their seller. In the many screenshots, I have one where the seller told me I was wrong in what I wanted and told me what I should have asked for. He then sent me what he wanted me to have and said, ""here take it"". The image he sent was not a complete image with just the word mother. Because both the Fiverr and Fiverr seller have both tried to strong arm me for standing up for my rights I am being punished by having my projects shut down in the middle of them.

305,"I would like to WARN all of you who desire to work online as a freelancer. No matter how skillful you are. No matter how unique your skills are. No matter how honest and dedicated to your work you are. JUST DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON FIVERR. Two years ago I started my journey on fiverr as a seller. 

Experience as a SELLER: I worked 24X7 since the beginning and within 3 months reached their Level 2 band. I had glowing 5 star reviews. Trust me I never bothered any buyer to review me. I was quick in my work and answering them back. I was not a top seller but I had steady sales and happy customers. Problems started after 5 months. By chance I created a gig which was unique on fiverr. Nobody had it. Soon it was getting lots of attention, queries and sales too. It was immediately copied by others. Suddenly one day fiverr cancelled my unique gig without giving any reason. When I contacted support they gave weird reason that enforcement team reported my gig and they cancelled it. I asked them how come their so called enforcement team not reporting other gigs who had copied mine and only reported mine. They did not answer. Then I noticed one of the other copied gigs suddenly gaining lots of reviews overnight. So I understood that fiverr has their own people working as sellers. They just stole my unique idea, cancelled my gig, created same gig to their own seller and increased number of positive reviews for that seller they wanted to highlight. When I questioned about it, they did not answer me anything and guess what, they started rejecting my other gigs one by one. In less than a week they removed my 5 top selling gigs. Further checking the gig analytics I noticed sudden drop in traffic to my remaining gigs. I contacted support for it, again they said my other gigs are not found compliant after being reported by users. Eventually they cancelled all of my gigs by the end of that fateful month and whenever I tried to recreate any gigs they kept canceling it. Finally they deactivated my account too. All this was not enough, here is the worst part. I had not withdrawn my 5 months hard earned money which amounted $12699 due to bank account issue and I didn't have any other mode to withdraw. I never imagined of any problem as I was busy and still happy doing my work so I delayed fixing my bank connectivity issue. They kept all my money too and never bothered to reply my emails. Needless to say all my 6 months of hard work was in vain.

Reached out to fiverr.com, provided a professional resume writer all requested information and, after seven days, still no response or product.  Reached out to the next one, paid $105 for resume, cover letter, and LinkedIn update with a six-day turnaround.  Just prior to midnight on day six, I get resume, cover letter, and request for my LinkedIn login info, which I promptly provided.

Two hours later, and long after I went to bed, she says I needed to give her the security code emailed to me, which I did. Hours later, she responded, ""it's too late.""  I ask her to provide me a time when she is available. 

Long story short- here we are, seven days PAST the six day due date, still no LinkedIn, but the order ""auto completed"" and she has my money.

Go to customer service, first for help on stopping auto complete; no help.  Then to complain that they have my money and I have no LinkedIn.  What does the customer service lead do?

317,"I recently joined Fiverr, as a buyer.  I wanted some illustrations done for my children books, that I had written. I also made some wrong moves, thinking that the sellers are honest and professionals. Two of the sellers on Fiverr, (who also had glowing ratings), are nothing but thieves. They refused to return my manuscripts, which I had also foolishly sent to them, to illustrate. Those two sellers are, 1. an Indian woman (who also used a much younger picture on Fiverr) name ""aparnapandabera"". Avoid this thief at all cost. She is arrogant, rude and unethical. My repeated requests for her to return my mss, were ignored by her. 2. The other seller's name is lunaitme. She is also a thief. She told me that other sellers could have  ""copied my manuscripts"", and I am sure that she herself did just that. Both of these sellers has so called positive reviews on Fiverr. I could not leave them a negative review. Please ask for samples of their work and you will see that their actual drawings are so crappy, that even a kindergarten student can draw much better. What they do is to show a lot of vector art on their profile page and their drawing skills are so low, that you will gasp at the actual results.  Any system, like Fiverr, that asks you to pay upfront (via credit cards, or paypal,or a Fiverr's account), before the artist actually does the work, is suspect. It is a great mistake, because you don't know how skilled those persons are. Many of them are not. I can do vector art myself and have also done the graphic designs, for my books. I also don't advertised myself as an illustrator, because of that fact. (And I have the books to prove my skills in regards to that fact).
I used Fiverr because it is supposed to be cheaper and save you a lot of time. I was wrong. I got quotes for those illustrations, at $550.00. I kid you not.
Another thing I find is that I could not sell on Fiverr. I tried to sell and it kept creating all kinds of problems for me. If I tried to type in my writing skills, such as creative writing, Fiverr's stupid system would not let me do that. 
And last, but not least. NO SERVICE ON FIVERR, IS FOR $5.00. as it claimed. Don't believe me?, then try buying some service on Fiverr and see if you actually pays $5.00, or anything close to that amount. That figure quoted by Fiverr, is to actually get you on to that site, but the rates are nothing close to that. $5.00 is just one tiny part of the cost. If you want the full service, form the seller, then you also be prepared to pay a lot more money. Don't trust certain sellers, like illustrators on Fiverr. They can't draw and uses digital technology, to rip you off.",1,"“Fiverr supports sellers who are dishonest, as long as they make money for Fiverr.” "

All I needed was someone to replicate my design into a cover that met the CreateSpace specifications. What I got was a product that looked like what I wanted, but met NONE of the specifications. CreateSpace had to make tons of changes to my file to get it to fit and it still looks bad. It took over a week to get my job done. The designer apparently has a master's degree in design (I'm sure that's fake) because there were so many typos and basic design errors, it took multiple revisions to get it done. And it still wasn't right in the end. The designer was based in Pakistan, so you have to deal with the time difference and language barrier. Avoid this service at all costs.

I started a non profit organization recently, and I am looking to have a logo made. I contacted a seller before hand and gave them an idea of what I wanted. 
I paid $105 for a logo, and got a 5$ quality logo. I mean total crap. I couldn't believe what I received for what I paid.  Seller refused to refund me. She was clever and said, ""If you wish to longer do business with me, then complete the order."" Meaning she will keep my money. She didn't seem to give a damn about her submission of a cheap rushed logo. I feel so undervalued and cheated. She has complete control over my cash and what she submits. If I open a dispute with her on Fiverr, all she does is cancel it. I opened this dispute many more times, but she cancelled them all. I opened dispute asap with Paypal, praying they will judge fairly and give me back my hard earned cash. Don't rely on the ""Top Rated Sellers"" like I did. 

There are many other issues that ring true. Any refunds you do get must stay in the Fiverr account. 
Sellers reviews are probably manipulated. 
and so much more, but I am exhausted and no longer wish to go in detail.
This isn't the first time a seller gave me extremely low quality products for money, but they kindly refunded me. I will no longer risk my money with fiverr.

321,"I like to support internet businesses so it saddens me to report  that Fiverrr earned less than one star from me after my experience with them.  tony_boi943 was the particular seller I used.  He made promises to answer questions and reply ""usually"" within 5 hours, but actually responded once every 24 hours if I was lucky--not even taking the time to answer my questions but always remembering to ask me for a  five star review.

Not only were the files poorly labeled so that I had to guess which file was specific to which fulfillment requirement, he sent files that wouldn't open in any of my programs and, ignored all of my requests for help.  I tried to cancel the order when his reponses started taking so long, but he refused the cancel (apparently sellers have to approve cancellations) and then he complained to me--still not answering my questions-- when I didn't give him a five star review.

I contacted Fiverr support, and they continually referred me back to the seller to work it out and asked me to keep them posted.  When I finally told them I would be contacting my credit card company to dispute the charge, they did finally send me links to help open some of the files I couldn't access and told me I would be restricted from their site if I disputed the charge.  Why those links weren't sent to me right away--and put on the website along with the files--is something they will work out for themselves, I suppose, if they want to run an internet business that has any kind of customer support.

You become successful and highly featured in the listed results for sellers by producing extremely sub par and sub intelligent, half assed, nearly automated feats of anti-imagination .

Taking a useless copy and slapping it onto a premade template is considered resume creation . I have had several experiences with fivrr and can  testify  that the results' most outstanding and  enduring quality has been that they are bad .  Merely bad . The ""gigs"" could be performed by a  Low-level computer program; and most likely are, in many cases .  The focus for the sellers is on quantity, not quality, and it is very difficult to place who, if not an endless supply of dissatisfied customers, they're for. There are few people I'm sure who lack the ingenuity to use Photoshop who still desperately require and can make any use of a corporate logo generated by its most  rudimentary  functions .  And few prospective employees entering the job market who don't understand where to find basic resume templates in word processing tools who have any success with their low-quality resume.

Customers also force you to do free revisions for completed work that they initially gave a five star review for and personal messages of praise for such a good job you do with your work.

First this started off with the day that my product was supposed to be delivered, she emailed me to ask for an extension because her mom was sick. Ok, while I do not think that's professional, I just asked for a refund, so that I could find someone else to do the work. At this point, I had not read reviews about Fiverr. The seller tried to cancel my order with the reason being that I did not provide her enough info. This was not true, I was extremely detailed in my work, and she was canceling because of her mom. Later in the day, I checked back in my account and the product was completed. This was odd being that she stated her mom was sick and she needed an extension; however, I was grateful and thought the product look exactly as expected. Wrong! There was one missing word and a spelling error. Easy fix right! Ok, three days later I received my revision. The revision was horrible and it was nothing I asked for. The business is medical based and she put a wine glass in two of the video shot (I DID NOT ASK FOR THIS). Afterwards, I asked for this to be fixed and to simply change the misspelled word in the video and add the other word that was missing. I was very detail, again, about the changes that I wanted. Well, three days later she cancels the order and says that this revision is not in the scope of work I can do. My issue now is, you've wasted almost two weeks of my time to tell me, now, that you can't change a misspelled word and add a word. I was so done.

363,"So I see a lot of reviews about buyers being scammed, and I totally see why. Fiverr is a good idea that's been executed poorly in all aspects, and I'll tell you, it's no cake walk for a real seller either. While having to compete with the cheaper copywriters and crap that run rampant across the website, the system in place where your exposure is totally dependant on reviews, while not unusual itself, is heavily influenced by that first review. My integrity as a seller is greatly influenced by the first review I get. With that comes the seller system where we don't get to pick what we can or can't take; if they order it, it accepts, with no regard to our work load, POOR money management wherein if you complete an order early, you still have to wait for the due date to pass,  PLUS two weeks to process and lost profit and it's just not worth it when you need the money NOW. There's also the matter of declination, which negatively impacts your page if you have to turn down someone, and the content timer where your maximum limit is 30 from (auto) accept or you get bad marks that pressures the sellers into rushing or becoming overloaded. Granted, there are some sleazy folks floating, but it completely washes away the chances or real work getting accomplished, and some buyers are just as cheap as the sellers. 

Case in point: I have two gigs set up, one for simple pencil story board for visual context, to turn script or novel into light cartoon format; and actual comic work, drawn, inked, etc, for two difference prices and extras. A customer began hounding questions about quality and such on the story board, which I gave a guarantee to, then asked if I can add ink to it, and I ago redirect him to the other option, after he claimed it was a story board for a film project. 
Storyboards don't require high quality ink. 
He now refuses to explain what the project is for, and instead of giving character designs, he insists on cutting a pasting ideas from copywrited images rather than make his own. From an artist standpoint, it's unbearable due to the copywriter fears, and his amoral lack of creative and poor writing ability, as well as his attempts at returning to ""story board plus ink"" instead of proper comic, which is more expensive, so it have given me a harsh sense of malice for my skill having to work with someone so unprofessional as to use ""lol"" in correspondence. He eventually bought the proper gig, but it left me two weeks to complete almost 20 pages, and desperate for money and that lauded first review, I had to comply, only to find out how in creative and fishy he was, as well as it would take a month to get my money, complete or no, and what originally started at $55 became $44, then $42 some odd through PayPal, etc, whereby I am trapped between quality of work, quantity of work, price and time, to either list realistic expectation of maximum days (29) and wait that long for money I need now, and push away buyers who want it ""quick"" or list impossible odds to make ends meet and have disgruntled buyers.

Next, he sent me a pdf filled with high quality image (which I found out was plagued from other design agencies) and claimed that those works are his.

385,"I am writing this review in order to add additional info to a previous review I wrote. My first review is still extremely accurate to how my experience with this website went, but I need to add two more elements to how fiverr will screw you over. 

Problem one: fiverr has no customer service. No number is provided. The only contact info is an email. On top of this the only response you will receive is automated and sketchy. I put in two separate complaints using their customer service email and received two identical responses from different customer service reps. Fiverr has gone as far as making up fake names for fake reps that send you automated email responses days after putting in requests. This leads me to conclude that there are no service reps that actually exist. If you ever have customer service problems on fiverr you will never get them resolved. 

Problem two: fiverr has very sketchy terms in their customer agreement. If you attempt to retreive funds from fiverr that are stuck in your ""shopping balance"" (refer to my previous review) fiverr you can put in a dispute with pay pal or your credit card service. Fiverr will send you another automated alert from a fake rep saying that this violates your terms of agreement and to promptly retract your dispute. So fiverr has found a very crafty way of keeping disatisfied customers money with the tactic. You can choose to keep your dispute active, but know this bit of sneaky information ----> If you do retract your dispute with pay pal you can not re open it. Do not retract your dispute in fear of breaking your agreement. Your best chance of retrieving your money is by letting this dispute continue. Hopefully your money is returned because fiverr must deliver the product that you payed for in order to keep the funds.

403,"I signed up for a gig to create a responsive website. I paid over $300 dollars and am still not getting anything wanted out of it. It has been 3 months now. If you let the seller mark the order as completed and let 30 days go by you can't get your money back and the seller can basically take as long as they want and ignore all your requests. The seller reviews don't mean anything as if you wait a short period of time once the gig is marked as completed you can not rate the seller. So if you are waiting for modifications you may not be able to review seller after the final project is completed. The sellers know this.

Update: the incomplete site is loaded. Hate it. Waste of money. Not once did Nextair ask me for my opinion. He just complained every time I asked for something.",1,“Marked as completed but actually nowhere near” 
404,"I have used fiverr before and it was ok but not great. This last time was the worst experience ever. A provider named csssandra promised to deliver a single page website design in 4 days. 3 weeks later after demanding more money it is still not done. They keep arguing over what is done and some places on the page still has latin words on it and says literally ""your name here"". The customer service is terrible and refuses to refund my money. I started with one person and they were terrible and I got a refund and I was not allowed to get my money back and had to hire someone else that cost more and that is how I ended up in the circumstance I am in right now. Just an absolutely awful experience and I would not recommend them for anything, ever.",1,“ALL THEY WANT IS YOUR MONEY” 
405,"I recently wrote a book that needed a cover and someone recommended Fiverr. I was told it was hit and miss, so I tried several designers just to see what they came up with. I figured at five bucks a pop it was worth a shot. They were all pretty terrible. It was worth a try, but I had just about decided to spend more money and use 99 Designs when I got the last cover  I had requested. It was perfect and I was elated to save the $299 that 99 Designs would have cost! Then the nightmare began. Because I did love it, I purchased extra services - then the designer went MIA. After two weeks of frustration (during which I missed a deadline), I contacted customer service and at the same time sent the e-cover (which was complete) to a different designer to covert into a full print cover (he did and it was usable). Well, apparently since I purchased extra services from the original designer, my ""completed"" order (with the ebook) was no longer considered complete and according to customer service, I didn't own rights to the design, but if I hadn't ordered the extra services, I would have! Go figure. So not only was I now out $60 for the extras I purchased from the original designer plus the extra fee I paid the new guy to convert something apparently I don't own, but I was now also out over two weeks of time, energy, frustration and lost the design I wanted. (not to mention another $25 fishing for ideas). 

As of this writing I have not received a penny back from Fiverr although they acknowledge the designer did not follow through and I'm supposed to get ""something"" back at some point. Although their customer service team is responsive their hands are tied. There is absolutely NO protection for their customers, and NO communication of several ""glitches"" in their system that can negatively impact you. I was not even able to leave a negative review for the designer since you are only able to leave reviews once the order is complete (Wondered where all those five star reviews come from? That is why!)

My advice is that if you are just fishing for ideas and have no timelines or deadlines, for five bucks--go for it. But if you need services for something that actually matters, stay FAR FAR FAR away. Fork up the cash and use a professional service from the beginning, it will actually save you both time and money in the long run.",1,“VERY Frustrating!!!” 
406,"As a service provider I take pride in completing my contracts on time. In fact, I normally give more than the clients expected. The last gig, the Fiverr server sent continues emails on one gig.  The client made an error and duplicated the gig request. I completed the gig within hours.  13 emails went back and forth between the client and myself and the client was happy with the results.  Two days later, Fiverr sends and email and reports me as late.  I contacted Fiverr, showed them the email trail and screenshots.  They understood it was a duplicate order  Fiverr response:  so sad. Dont worry its showing only for late for 60 days??  I said what? I was not late!  I provided the service.  They said nothing can be done.    They are stuck and inflexible. The service is good  if you have no issues.  Otherwise, be prepared for uncaring and poor service.

407,"Hi, I bought a gig on fiverr to design a logo after going through the pain to find the right designer. After a bit of a hoo,ha, he got it right. I decided to let this guy design the next logo and ordered a more expensive gig with source files. This is where the wheels fell off. This guy dragged his feet and suddenly he couldn't design anything. It went past the deadline and I gave him an extension because he needed more time and he will get penalized if the order is not marked as complete. BIG MISTAKE. He is gone with the money and I have no design. Lost time and money. There was a big customer on my side that I lost because I couldn't present my goods.

408,"I had many friends recommend Fiverr so I checked it out. Looked like fun! Choosing a graphic designer to do a 5""x7"" double sided postcard for me was exciting. I chose a guy who I felt had all the fun and creative graphic postcards and got started on my first $5 purchase.

The first communications were so weak and confusing that I was getting scared. I wanted to cancel right then and there. What happened is that I sent in the requirements with my photos and threw in some notes and all I got back was ""helo. hi"" There was no response to anything in my first email and it felt weird.

The first draft was a post card design that I could have done myself on vista print. All my specifications were ignored. So, I marked up the postcard with notes, sent it back, and sent an email that I was disappointed that this did not look like any of his gigs posted. I gave specific examples of the postcards that I liked. His response was a sad emoticon.

I got the second draft and only some changes were done and those changes were again the same simple plain stuff as the first and not very noticeable. I could have done those changes myself.

I sent a message to the seller and told him that I was really unsatisfied and to keep the $5. I  gave him a horrible review. 

Now, as I am writing this, I have received 8 well written and clear emails from him (more are coming as I just wrote that last sentence). He's said that he was shocked and upset that this was not to my satisfaction. What could he do to fix it. Now that the bad review went through for him, he is begging for me to remove it because it's lowering his rating and he can't accept other posted jobs and will fix anything that I need. I would like to add that the email response is so much quicker now. The prior two answers he gave me took 24hrs each time.

4. Once the system marks the order as completed, money is released to the seller 14 days after. You can only cancel order out of mutual consent with the seller. 
5. When you query Fiverr for such a bogus process, customer support is quick to pull up terms of service that you will probably be seeing for the first time and telling you that orders are only refunded back into your ""shopping balance"". But this BS and bogus if you fall for it. They have no right to hold on to your funds as it violates the credit card industry guidelines for merchants or with PayPal.

They will put restrictions on your accounts saying that opening a dispute with PayPal or your Credit Card company is a violation of their bogus ""terms of service"" They will urge you to close those disputes for the matter to be resolved, if you fall for it, you lose your right to fight for a refund through those channels as for example in PayPal, closed disputes cannot be reopened or escalated to PayPal Claims.

My advice, just stay away. It is rather unfortunate because I would imagine that there are some genuine sellers with honest intentions to deliver good service but really they are like the remnants. My advice to such is to leave these fraudsters and go to platforms such as Upworks.

I have been trying to get a gig finished for three weeks. The first seller that I contacted didn't take any action on the gig until 30 minutes before the due date and then wanted me to resubmit all of the requirements to him again. I cancelled that order and returned to someone who I purchased a gig off of a year ago which cost me 4 times as much. Then even though I had $10 in credit on my account, your site pulled the full amount out of my PayPal.
After I returned to a previous seller that I used a year ago, I provided all of the requirements and heard nothing back until the day of the deadline where I received an email claiming connectivity issues and that he would need an extra 24-48 hours on my gig. I agreed to provide him the extra time and the due date came and went again without any product being given.
When I contact him this morning, I get a .png file instead of the different versions that the gig promises and no source files. To make it worse, the image doesn't fit on the size page that I informed him multiple times that I was looking for.
So bottom line is that I was scammed out of my $40 plus your commission. To say that I will never use your service again is an understatement.

I went on Fiverr looking for someone to help me with my landing page. At first I was very optimistic and elated by the prices and values. I even started thinking about sourcing all my work there. 

The first few people I messaged took a day or so to message me back, and with a deadline I needed help fast. I then created a request and a person responded saying they would create my page for only $5 bucks. I thought, ""wow this is great"" without realizing very few people will do quality work for that amount of money. This guy promised me a nice squeeze page in less than 24 hours, and after giving him my WordPress info and waiting almost 2 days, I can tell you the site looks nothing like what I asked for. It doesn't even look like a sales page so much as a bunch of mumbo jumbo put together. Granted, he tried, and he gave me some useful images but it's no where near what I requested. Part of me feels I should have known better than trying to trust a $5 service, but the other part feels these people should be able to create what they offer. So, I paid this guy for his time and asked him to exit my WordPress account. Two days wasted but a good lesson learned. 

Since then I have tried to take up other services but now I'm not as open to it. I realize there are some really good artists and designers on there simply trying to make a buck, but for every one good seller there's a few shady ones that may waste your time. 

My tip to you is that you have standards while performing your search, and try to avoid paying until a sample of your requested work is completed. Furthermore, if you need word content on your site, or have a lot of info to explain, try to find someone very fluent in English or you will have issues. Last, someone may advertise $5 bucks but most services cost more than that. $5 is for most to simply look at your work, and depending on your work load your fee can go up substantially, so in some cases you may be better off looking for someone reputable.

463,"I am an ex-Fiverr freelancer, and I say ex- for a few very good reasons, from all perspectives - freelancers selling gigs, customers buying those gigs, and the company itself. Let me enumerate why I left Fiverr.

1. Actual freelance work is generally hard to get in the first place if you're just starting out, unless you are willing to ""SELL! SELL! SELL!"" your product or service at a rock bottom price. In other words, about $1 USD/hr. The only way around this is to induce your ""upsell"", or else farm out your work to even lower paying workforces. Note that there is also a good chance that your ""client"" is in fact just another Fiverr worker, looking to act as a broker, and scouting out new talent. This is what happened to me. They were simply taking my work, making a few tweaks, and upselling to another client at a higher hourly rate.

Also, know up front that Fiverr will take a dollar out of every five dollars (not gigs, actual amount paid - $5 gig you get $4, custom order $500 gig, they get $100 etc.) so that's 20% of your earnings gone right there. Not only that, they will charge you additional money to transfer your money out of your Fiverr account to Paypal (who also might charge you, depending on how you've set your account up.) Fiverr will happily retain your earnings for a full 2 weeks (10 business days) before you are paid for your work. Excellent business practice, guys - nice way to scam your workforce!

2) I've never been an actual buyer on Fiverr, but pretty much all the issues that everyone else has brought up is right on the nose. Low cost equals low quality, in general. Not to mention copyright issues, communication issues, payment issues, and the overarching ethics of doing business this way.

The sweetest part about this? They also have a (imho) fishy payout schemes like Payza and Payoneer which issue you a debit card, on which there's also a fee.

As you can probably tell, I'm not happy with this business in the least.",1,"“A prime site for low cost, low quality work. And a complete SCAM!” "
464,"Tinker M.
Q: I work for a company called Zazzle. At our forum we learned that this company is copying owned art and selling it on their products. A lot of it. And we are just one place. This is a criminal offense and I suggest anyone who sells artwork with Print on demand companies check to see if there art is there. One item is labeled best selling and has sold many times, if yours is one of these get a attorney and send a cease and desist and demand whatever money they earned to be returned to you.",1,“Copyright Theft?” 
465,"As a buyer I have had over 60 projects completed on fiverr and it is always a challenge.
The worst part of doing business on the site is trying to find and interract with customer support.
There are many 3rd world sellers that are trying to make a buck on a wing and a prayer and they don't have a clue about deadlines, quality or service.
I don't use fiverr much anymore. Too frustrating.",1,“Fiverr unresponsive to problems” 
466,"I just wanted to take a couple of seconds to stress a point of view regarding Fiverr. Fiverr is exactly what it promotes itself to be. It is a cheap gigs platform where all incompetent scammers have an opportunity to prey on people looking for cost effective work to be performed. The idea behind providing a free platform for offer and demand exchange is great but it comes with consequences to the users. The winners in Fiverr are the lousy freelancers and Fiverr owners. The big losers are the ones that use them:) so bottom line is you get what you pay for !!  If you want good quality work, I suggest you use other quality platforms that use quality and evaluated freelancers. NOT the cheap Fiverr!! Good luck!!!",1,“Fiverr is a cheap gigs platform”

I literally could have created the same logo in less a minute. The only reason I didn't create the logo myself was because I wasn't familiar with vector programs. Even so, I know how to use the damn text tool. Of course he ignored the few (stupidly simple) requests I had for the logo.

477,"UPDATE:
After my first attempt at a getting a book cover done ended in disaster and missing a distribution deadline due to the Fiverr Seller's inability to understand simple English instructions, I got a refund for the full amount.
But that terrible experience costs sales for a book we were doing for Christmas distribution. 
After a 24 hour delivery was promised it took 10 days to end up with very poor quality work that was rejected and I got the refund. That's not what I wanted.
2nd Attempt with Fiverr.
After a rocky start, the 2nd Fiverr Seller was much better but I have to wonder why people who seem to have no basic design sense are graphic designers. Simple things need to be spelled out in the extreme. Things like u don't need a huge publisher's logo in the bottom back cover corner. You shouldn't put the author's name right on the very edge of the cover.
After several revisions the 2nd attempt did end up working out. However, it was December 28 by then and many lost Christmas sales.
I was so amazed and grateful the 2nd Fiverr Seller managed to complete the job, I actually gave them a bit more money.
But it's not the money that's the issue. It's the lack of quality control.
Anybody with a computer can join Seller and claim to have a skill.
WARNING: Fiverr does not pre-check work of the Sellers. They rely solely on customer reviews so if you can get on a few different machines and get some friends to give you 5 Star reviews, you look like an expert. It's fraudulent and irresponsible behavior on Fiverr's part but all they are interested in is their 5%. Their policies are entirely about them, not the customer. So I would say try it if you must but don't spend much and don't expect much. In fact, if it's a design project, may as well get Adobe InDesign and learn to use it yourself. It's what I plan to do.
Overall Fiverr is about making money for Fiverr and has no interest in the quality of work done by its Sellers. With Fiverr you are totally on your own. But if it doesn't work out, threaten legal action and you'll get your refund sent quickly.",1,"“Fiverr cares only about Fiverr, not customers” "

Hi , i didn't want my money back that is not what i care about , i care about you guys taking accountability for your sellers and correcting this issue , he should not have the right to be a certified seller on your site if this is how he is going to react by posting 100 Facebook 1 star ratings and trying to post negative reviews , that is childish and pathetic , i will be copying all links to this to many review sites to show what customer support at fivver gives , if i wanted money back and wanted to cancel the gig i don't need your help i was able to do that on my own ,. the point of writing a complaint is to have the issues rectified or have the seller removed

501,"There are a number of reasons to avoid this website.  For starters, if you try to get a sample of what an artist can produce at a bargain, you'll get little more than someone finding clip art or copyrighted works, and trying to sell them to you with their watermark attached.  If you try to get advertising, you'll either get: a) someone posted your add to a site nobody ever heard of, or b) someone will promise ""likes,"" downloads, etc., and then their account will disable after you paid through Fiverr.  Also, Fiverr will not refund anything.  They'll claim that they can't refund after an order is ""complete.""  Their definition of ""complete"" must be a little flexible...  There are numerous similar stories all over the Internet regarding how people get their money taken.  But, it's not just customers looking for a good deal, it's also sellers.  They get lots of money in their accounts and then Fiverr deletes their accounts, claiming they violated the sites terms.  In addition, their site is not very well designed at all and the few services they offer are not very useful at all.  I mean, who really needs someone to ""... sing Happy Birthday as jungle boy in the River?""",1,“Stay away from this site!” 
502,This site is a r ip out. There is no customers service.  Afer they get you money they act as if they have no accountability to the customers at all.  They wont email you back or call you back.  They just don't care after they have your money.,1,“A BIG FAT RIP OFF!!!!!” 
503,"During my 9 months on Fiverr, as a seller, I have been bullied, offended and humiliated by some buyers whose main pupose was to take advantage of how the site allows them to obtain free work. It is quite common for a buyer to manipulate any sale by threatening to leave negative feedback.
Without any warning or a courtesy email, Fiverr decided to recently restrict my account which, following my enquiries to their cutomer desk, they allege that, and I quote, ""we've received several complaints from your previous buyers regarding the performance of your services on Fiverr. After further review of your previous order and account history, your account has been disabled. Fiverr condemns bullying, harassment, and hate speech towards others. Taking in to consideration multiple factors, we can not allow sellers on our marketplace who offer poor experiences for buyers.
Please contact us again after a safety period of 45 days to learn how to withdraw any available revenue from this account.""
To clarify, I had a 100% score from 59 five-star reviews and repeat business from multiple buyers, which it is not a reflection of poor performance. I have been a exemplary seller and I am too against bullying, harrassment and hate speech towards anyone, especially behind a computer screen.  If Fiverr believes that getting sellers to be manipulated by the actions of some of their buyers will help the site, perhaps time will show them differently. I would also like their services to provide me with the details of the complaints they mentioned (which I have asked them already and have not been provided with as yet) so that I can take the matter further and defend mysef and my good name in the appropriate setting.
I dispute all of the allegations made by Fiverr, especially but not exclusively those of providing a poor experience to buyers and would like to have this matter assessed by their legal team prior to taking it to a law court. As it appears account restrictions on their site are directy and indirectly connected to breach of their terms of service (which are not substantiated by the communications with the buyers that potentially made these alleged complaints). It is astonishing to see this account disabled.
The ""previous order"" that Fiverr mentions in their response to me was of a buyer that had his sale review REMOVED 3 TIMES for breaching Fiverr's terms of service. I will omit this buyer's ID for legal reasons.
I would like to clarify that a mesage was sent to this buyer stating: ""As per this gig description, I only provide a PDF file... Please specify the changes you need to make to the original document and I will amend it accordingly. Regards.."". The buyer never requested any changes and started making big assertions to the effect that, and I quote, "" The format sent by seller is not editable and thus is useless."" in a attempt to cancel the order mutually and despite knowing, from the gig description, that the final gig was only to be delivered in pdf. I responded by stating that, and I quote, ""the terms and conditions of sale are clearly described. You are attempting to obtain something that you're not entitled to and, therefore, I am not accepting the cancellation of this order. If you need to amend/edit the document in the future you'll need to do it through me. I have delivered the an employee handbook to you, in pdf format, as specified for this gig for which I charged you $15"". It seems that Fiverr believes this is providing a poor experience but is it? and to whom?
The ""several complaints"" that Fiverr mentions in their response to me are, most likely, and in my opinion, coming from the same buyer. Strangely enough, after a few months of not hearing from a previous buyer that purchased the same gig as the person specified above, this buyer asked me, in similarity to the above, whether I could provide them with a 'word file', despite them knowing that my gig description states that such service is not available. Coincidentally, These two buyers are located in the same country too.
I would like to point out that Fiverr is based in Israel.

Best thing to do when you get ripped off from fiverr.com, which is a very good chance you will, just do what I did, submit a paypal claim and dispute. fiverr will not fight your claim since they know most users are getting scammed.

511,"Our company needed a map illustration/perspective drawing done and decided to try out one of the illustrators from Fiverr. The person we placed the order with had really good reviews and his portfolio seemed pretty good and he was confident that he would be able to deliver what we needed based on the examples I provided him. I was very specific in the style and detail of drawing that I wanted and also sent him examples. This was a custom order and turned out to be more costly than I expected, but I still went with him trusting that he would deliver.

When I received the first draft, it was nothing like the quality and standards that I expected. I was so shocked and disappointed. The style of drawing looked nothing like the examples I showed him, the perspective was off, colors were all wrong, and just the level of attention to detail wasn't there.

I attempted to provide very clear instructions on the revisions that I wanted to see changed on the illustration, but the results kept getting worse and worse. I also felt like he didn't put much effort into making the changes and just the quality of work was horrible.

I felt like this illustrator should not have agreed to take on this project if he wasn't comfortable doing these types of drawings.

This was my first time using Fiverr and overall, I'm extremely disappointed and frustrated and I don't think I will trust using Fiverr again. 

After filing a complaint and disputing this case, the Fiverr customer support team was completely useless. It took them 1 week to respond to my request and they didn't do anything about it.",1,“Didn't get what I was expecting”

I started off really happy creating my seller account on fiverr and after several hours of making my gigs perfect i published waiting to getsome orders. After a day my account was terminated! And i was very dissaponited and contacted fiverr right away. I asked them why and they said i had broken terms and conditions by having two accounts. I told them several times that it was a mistake and if they could give me more details they said ""sorry, your account cannot be reverted"". And i had asked the rep if there was anything i could do, what was recommended espeacially because i had no other account and the rep replied with "" you can create another account but it will probobly be terminated too"".

Revlec simply ignored me. Per the terms of the site, which I am disputing, I can only receive a credit for services. I cannot wait another 20 days and can't even leave feedback for the scam seller, because they are permitted to unilaterally cancel. Also, if you look carefully, sellers are leaving feedback for one another to inflate ratings.

I cancelled the order, but you can NOT get your money back if that happens, they stay on your Fiverr ""account"".

517,"I had delivered the order, which was a website and its code in html including all necessary files. After delivering whatever the buyer asked he started abusing the request modification button and want to cancel the order. SO basically whatever he want was for free.
I reported the issue to customer service, No reply its been days now.
Another bug was also there in the site. If you deliver the order its status will be marked completed after 3 days. I waited for 3 days. Time decreased from 3day to 1 day to 1 hour to 1 min then it instead of changing the status to completed the time started increasing again,from 1 min to 2 min to 1 hour to 1 day now.

I even gave him the font that i want and the photo what i want done. He just changed the color from the first one he gave me. I told him i wanted a mannequin, he gave me a dress in a hanger drawing even though ive sent him an attachment for the drawing i wanted.

Like what should i do with that.  I gave a 4 star to another seller and he begged me to get my refund back. So i just changed my reviews to five star. I did not want my $5 back. I was just giving out a review through a very honest opinion of what he delivered.

I would not want to give them any reviews then if they wont honor it... It's kinda weird... I think fiverr should be more strict to whom they permit to do their job on fiverr...

I know these people are just trying to make a living but what the hell, its also unfair for the customers to keep on paying and not getting what we want.

I know $5 is peanuts but if you keep on paying $5 due to the sellers incompetency or maybe they dont understand you, it will become $50 or $100 dollars.

It's not cheap at all.... It's unfair...",1,“Sellers does not follow instructions...” 
519,"Using Fiverr to develop a website I came across one 'developer' and I use that term loosely, who looked to have all the credentials you would expect. After too-ing and fro-ing we settled on a price of $260 and so he went to work (elsewhere I presume). 2 months passed before I received a very poorly modified $65 template that had broken links and links that took anyone who clicked them back to his servers. I can't leave feedback for the seller as it was too long ago and that works very nicely for him because he doesn't get bad feedback.
My advice - stay well clear of Fiverr.",1,“Total Rip-Off”

DO NOT USE THIS APP/SITE.  IT IS A COMPLETE SCAM!",1,“SCAM ALERT!”

So I have to PAY him for illegally defrauding me.  Ive contacted support several times and no answer.  It's been several days now.

Also, Fiverr doesn't back up or protect their sellers from PayPal fraud and the cancellation loophole, though it forces us to continue using PayPal.

They provided work that didn't meet the guidelines making me wait for them to fix their  screwups.  Also, the average wait time to get a response from Support is THREE DAYS.  They advertise on their site it's 12-18 hours which is a lie.  These people who are contractors hide out behind computer screens trying to sell themselves for something they are not.  It's all a scam to the buyer.  It's a great way for a loser who has no skills to try and make money behind a computer screen who normally wouldn't be able to get a job in the real world.

They have the autonomy to report it a delivered or complete regardless of if the actual order is complete and the fiverr system accepts this. There is no independent authentification. Once delivered, the website processes the order as complete and pays seller unless buyer request a modification or the seller and buyer mutually agree to cancel the order.

Well its their word against yours,,, No active customer service dept to regulate the sellers activity  so buyer takes ALL THE RISKS.

I provided them information proving they use bots for fake clicks to websites. I let them work for 1 month which showed not on single real person came to my site from them and all clicks came from three different cities with only the ip addresses changing slightly. They immediately filed a mutual agreement to refund my money which initially I thought was pretty straight up until i realized the money goes into your fiverr account for more jobs. I did write a ticket to the head of the support and he actually did refund it back to paypal .....but

as soon as the seller sent the mutual cancellation and i accepted it (with no knowledge of what ill explain later anywhere in site), that erased the possibility of me leaving a review of this fraudulent seller (he had something like 22k reviews 5 star) so basically the fraudulent seller have a shield and a way to hide on the site provided by fiverr themselves.

I have to wonder if fiverr is in cahoots with fraudulent sellers because of the high 5 star rating for an obvious fraud and for the ways they provide them to keep this hidden and does not give an accurate review system which is so important. it all only makes sense if this whole thing is geared to screw you from your money which is what i think is happening here.

based on the many other reviews I've read across the internet  i think i got extremely lucky getting my money back to paypal.

My orders were cancelled left and right with no explanation. I confronted the sellers about it, saying it was false advertising/extortion, and I contacted Fiverr's customer service for assistance. The very next day, Fiverr knocked me off of the to levels I worked two years to achieve.

Most work provided there is crap, these so called writers use word spinners, 99,5% designers use clipart for logos of templates for other stuff (business cards, flyers etc), lots of copyright infringement, most work in their gallery examples is fake.

I'm very very very displeased with your customer service. I don't think I'm interested in using the service of the website for fear of delay and inconvenience that I might have to wait days before I can get someone from customer service get back to me, and freelancer refuses to start working based on the fact I can't make or process payment. I've dealt with many many tech companies, large and small and I should say this one is the only in a long long time, perhaps in years that let me feel so dissatisfied with the service, I almost felt angry as I ended getting no work done and missing schedule as a lack of time customer service, come on guys, we are living in 2015 here.

I provided a clear outline of what should be covered in the article and several websites where they could research the topic and find all the info they needed.  Even though the seller had such great reviews, I still didn't have high expectations - I just needed a decent write up. 
The article I received was such low quality, though. Poor grammar, lots of repetition, no mention of the key requirements in  my outline - high-school level writing - and that is giving it too much credit.
When I complained to the writer, he said it was written by one of his newer writers and he has so many writers he can't look at them all. (What about his profile that implied he writes all the articles and was passionate, etc etc.?) He also said, ""I try to only hire American English speaking writers, but since I only correspond with them through email, it is hard to say sometimes.""  I realize now that he is farming out the work to people anywhere in the world, he has no quality control.  I don't know how he has managed to get so many good reviews, but I do know that it was impossible for me to leave a bad review.

AND - this guy was probably one of the good ones, because at least he responded to my criticism and offered me a refund (it's not really a refund, it's a credit since I don't get the money back.)  

So, who wins in this situation?  Fiverr does - they get to keep my transaction fee and they will get the $5 I was ""refunded"" because I will never use that credit. 

I understand their business model now: Fiverr doesn't care about quality. At all. They make money on every job, no matter what happens. The vendor profiles are complete lies - they make it sound like they are doing the work but they are just farming it out to whomever, with no quality control.

Hello Alan,
Ok, I understand the details. About point 8, did you mean turn by turn directions, because this is what google maps api can provide. About the price, Do you really think that this project deserves $5. $5 is the standard charges to create the gig on fiverr. I will charge $600 for this project. I am a student and I usually work on weekends. I have a little too much on my plate this week. So I believe I can deliver you next weekend. till 27 of this month. Is it ok with you??

The other problem is that seller reviews are a fraud.  Sellers can avoid negative feedback by simply canceling the job.  The only way you can leave negative feedback for a seller is if you pay full price for incomplete or unsatisfactory work.  Otherwise you have to agree to a cancellation to get your money back and you loose the right to rate them.  Also, sellers can cancel unilaterally even if you don't agree.

Many off these sellers also offer free gigs for leaving them positive feedback, this should not be allowed. A buyer should be allowed to leave an honest and constructive review off the gig, good or bad. Abusive feedback to the seller should not be allowed. 

Feedback on the traffic gigs should again be better from the buyers. Results is what counts from traffic not clicks. As l stated earlier l have never found an honest gig on traffic on fiverr. The clicks show on the link they send you but not on my trackers. Real Scam traffic gigs.

Hello Support Team,

THIS IS AN URGENT MATTER AND I WANT YOUR ATTENTION TO OUR PROBLEM THAT WE ARE FACING DUE TO YOUR UNPROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOUR.I have submitted tickets for numerous time and that too for the same reason.WE ARE HERE FACING A SERIOUS & MAJOR ISSUE OF GIGS DEACTIVATION and WE NEED YOUR RESPONSE ASAP.i am astonished that your team is not helping out and had left us hanging in between by not responding to our tickets.IS THIS THE PROFESSIONAL WAY TO TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS?

If you arent aware of the reason then Let me again summarise it for you.I have been told that we are operating mass accounts from the same IP and thats why the gigs have been deactivated.COME ON!! ARE YOU SERIOUS?? Since 8 months,We are working as a freelancer on your portal from India,giving our 100% to become a Top Rated seller from level 1 and What you are doing now is FLUSHING THE WATER ON OUR HARD EARNED EFFORTS.If you dont know then We are using shared internet connection in our commercial complex where our office is based and Looking at your portals popularity,There must be various Fiverr accounts that are operated by different freelancers from our complex.We cannot check with each and every person working in our complex whether they are having Fiverr accounts or not. So do you think that it is the right way to check the authenticity of a person just from the IP address?? If your answer is YES then I highly recommend you to use some authentic procedure like requesting legal document(Driving license, voting card,etc) while opening any account and i am sure it will save you from blame of deactivating accounts just on the basis of IP address.Even you can use verification by video calling in the same manner like other portals are doing.I can show you legal documents for our account verification or you can video call me on Skype and confirm my identity.

By the way,Do you have any standard policies regarding the verification of person that is operating any particular account?? because i havent came across with any of such notification from your side at the time of opening my account and if it is not like that then i will make sure that you face a legal action from authorized entities to protect my customer rights.

You does not follow standard procedure for verification and YOU TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS IN A UNPROFESSIONAL MANNER and that disappoints to me a huge extent and even WHAT I CANNOT DIGEST IS YOUR AUDACITY TO DEACTIVATE MY GIGS WITHOUT NOTIFYING ME, after all its my Fiverr profile.right? Dont i have the right to be notified prior to deactivation of my gigs?

But one thing is certain that You have done serious damage to my business and i cannot allow that.Though you not notified to me but i am notifying you that if i am not getting response from you guys within 48 hours and then i will have to take this matter into court.And I assure you that you will land yourself in a huge mess if my gigs are not activated within 24 hours.

I am also planning to switch my business to some other portal where customer is well served,NOTIFIED PRIORLY,having FINE SENSE OF VERIFYING CUSTOMERS.Also,i will not recommend your portal to any of my friends.I dont want to ruin my reputation among my friends by recommending portal who doesnt even care to respond to client's query.

My site is about budget family travel. I gave a very detailed explanation of what I needed and my site url for reference. I assumed the designer would visit the site and get a feel for what it needed. 

Instead, I got a logo in a very patriotic color scheme that looked very much like it was supposed to resemble a mother giving birth. Basically a large ""C"" shape, open side down, with a circle on top (moms head). Then another of the same shape, only smaller, flipped around and placed inside the ""arms""  of the mom.

If you are a proffesional and have been working as a freelancer in other webs or with agencies you will find this place as ridiculous as I did.

Lets get started with the only Pro:
- (Some) Friendly Buyers with nice ideas. Period.

Now the Cons:

- 20% commission, you paid dear not the buyer. Pretty high for $5 huh?.

- Fiverr works by levels:
* 0 - You can only work per 5
* 1 - $5, $10 and $20 are allowed
* 2 - $5, $10, $20 and $40 are allowed
Top rated seller - Fiverr choose you. In order to be picked you must be a good boy okay? Oh, and did I meantion you MUST overdeliver and make free revision to be choosen? Yes, and all for $4.

- Silliest rules you've ever read:
* No portfolio url, only web allowed is Flickr. If you post any other portfolio prepare to lose all of your levels and perks, oh, if you are new forget about leveling up soon.

* Skype, mail, message, contact, etcare bad words. You get a red warning for writing it.

* Vacation time for your account only for 28 days per year (Yes! As if you were actually working on a real job!)

* Any mistake, even post an innocent url means get your levels removed and the tags from your gigs, also your gigs do not appear on front page. Fiverr support does nothing about it.

* 5 star rating system for a $4 USD work. I mean, really?

* Paypal buyers can pay and ask paypal to refund. Yes! FIVERR HAS NOT GUARANTEED PAYMENT FOR FREELANCERS!. Support does nothing about it.

* If you need to 'suspend' your gig for any reason you must acknowledge that doing means for it to lose ranking on the search engine, even if it's the best out there.

* You cannot choose with who you want to work with, people purchase your product and if they ask apples for a gig that sales watermelons, guess what happens? YOU ,as a seller, lose perks, cannot level up in the near future and get bad rating. Just what you read.

Do the same!!! If you don't get your money back, contact local authority to where THEY are. These kids are playing games with peoples money. Do NOT join or use Fiverr.com!!!

685,"I contacted a seller on fiverr and asked them if they could do the job they advertised.  They said yes so I paid them.  They then did not do the work but said the job was done.  I contacted fiverr but their feedback page is broken.  I left negative feedback for the seller but that's all I could do.  

I've been using fiverr for a long time and have found some major problems with them.  For example a seller can completely ignore a payment and the buyer can't leave
negative feedback for that.  Or the seller can accept the job, sit on
it for weeks and then give it back to the buyer and again they can't
leave feedback.  What?  Yes, you heard me:  sellers can ignore you for
weeks and you can't complain. 
Even if the seller does accept the job there is no way to encourage
them to actually do the work and no way to dispute it.  After a seller
says a job is done the buyer is given a box to click positive or
negative feedback.  Where's the dispute button?  Your money is gone
whether you're satisfied or not.

""But this seller has 99% feedback, must be good, right?"" 
Wrong:  sellers create a fake buyer account and buy from themselves and
leave positive feedback.  Unlike eBay who check personal information
and ban people using the same address or credit card, fiverr only
requires an email to buy or sell so it only takes a second to create a
fake account.  Since the feedback is just a percentage you can't see
who gave positive feedback for what, so a seller only needs to create
one account and buy a few times from themselves to give themselves a
stellar feedback score.

No one is going to make a logo for even $50. A good design takes time, effort, research and building blocks to access what you need as a client. Also, plagiarism is ramped. So if you want to pay $5 for something, it's always up to you. However, I will avoid this website. I gave it three stars because it does help true freelancers gain a bit if income, but I believe $5 is just too good to be true. With the fees, you won't make much as a seller either.

I work as a creative in the design field, so let me tell you: you will see a difference between something $5-100 and something $500. True freelancers: don't let this be tha platform for you to make money, you're getting ripped off. For buyers, be careful of what you buy. Many ""designers"" here fake their work, steal work, or misrepresent stock designs as their own or original.

I went to one of Fiverr's city events just to eat, drink and collect their goodie bag. I will never do business with them again.

I wasted 50.00 on having a website made, I kept ketching  errors and having all kinds of changes even after it was finished. The designer was good to work with and changed what was needed!  So, I got it on line and could never get it to take off, to start getting calls, so, this year I just had it removed!   Most of the vendor's on fiverr are amaturs! You get what you pay for!

701,"I went to fiverr looking for a new logo design. After wasting tons of time filtering a lot of offerings I chose three designers and gave them the job. One of them despite having an impressive portfolio really wow stunning original logo designs, she delivered a very amateur design so the portfolio logos weren't her work ... obviously. Second designer the same story, fake and stolen design portfolios.

How could fiverr be done smarter? When I post a job, I want to be able to filter gigs by the number of verified jobs done and the feedback ratings. I can't do that and it shows me a designer with #1 rating just because she/he got two jobs and got highest feedback probably were her/his friends. If I am willing to pay for quality and say I place a budget of $400 for a design I want to keep all the fake, junk and scammers away and not waste my time.

Beware of Arbitrage: arbitrage are people that have a luxury level portfolio and they look authentic designers but at the end they are subcontracting other designers and getting a margin. Yes they are making money without doing anything ... fiverr can detect this easily by automatically analyzing the reviews tree because the arbitrage folks give reviews to the real providers too.

You can get what you need eventually after spending a lot of time. If your budget is higher you will get more junk to filter out and fiverr doesn't help.",2,“Empty boxes all around ...”

705,"I know people who have had really great experiences on Fiverr but mine was mediocre at best.
I will not name the Fiverr I worked with as this person truly wanted to get better BUT some of the tactics used were less than professional.

Here are some tips to watch out for...

- Make sure you know exactly what you need AND the technical language to get what you need. Most gigs will have extra cost add-ons but are vague in what they entail.
- The videos posted on a Fiverr gig sites as examples of their work are not necessarily done by that person. Make sure you ask if the sample video is theirs.
- The star rating system can be flawed. My Fiverr asked that I rate them before the project was done... they did this by closing out the project and starting a new one when I asked for fixes. This was very unprofessional and I refused to rate them until I had the finished project in hand. I think it's a way to get around the company restrictions and to get more ratings since you'll be asked again on the second project once it's finished. 
- I was also pressured to give 5 stars. Once I rated (at 3 stars) I was emailed multiple times to ""please change my rating"". This is understandable since a bad rating can really hurt their chances of landing a gig... but I'm making you aware that it can happen.
- I was not satisfied with the end product and decided not to use it. You can get a refund if you are not satisfied but because our working relationship was positive I did not want to do this and chalked it up to the price of doing business... tax write off.
- Prices can change once you agree to your gig. I work in the same industry that I was asking the Fiverr to do work for. My instructions were clear and specific. When questions were asked if they could create an asset that was most important to my project, the Fiverr confirmed that they could do it. Two days into the project, I was told they couldn't do what I had asked for unless I paid over $100 extra... which I now know couldn't be achieved even if I'd paid... which I didn't. What I did do was downsize my request and ask for less than what I thought I had originally paid for.
- On a positive note - The Fiverr I worked with was probably green. They communicated with me extremely well and wanted to make sure I was happy. I provided most of the assets they needed so it was an easier gig than most I would think. I was very easy going with them the entire gig letting them take as much time as needed. They claimed they worked through the night and that they bought new equipment for what I was asking for. I don't know if either of these statements were true but I'll lean towards the positive.",2,“DON'T EXPECT BRILLIANCE”

One purchase never again.,2,“No vetting of sellers”

My biggest irk with Fiverr, is the sellers badging me for a good review when their products have been s**t. I've been generous with some of my reviews and yet I still get emails asking for 5 stars. If it's not worth five stars, I'm not giving it five stars.",2,“Hit and miss”

the people who sell their services are usually way to cocky arrogant and most of all scammers. now everyone on here is not a scam but i would say less than half of my experiences have been unpleasant cancellation or a scam.
I have had positive experiences from some people but they do not out way the negitive. fiverr doesnt do enough to help the people who they are taking their money from. here is one example. you can not change your rating from a seller after five days. so that means once you find out you were scammed its too late. my advice is to not rate. here is why people rate though fiver SAYS you are not obligated to rate but every time you log in there is a light at the top of your screen saying ""oops looks like you for got to rate your experience lets do this now""  what ever they are a rip off but their are a couple of people on there who are just trying to work for extra cash.",2,“The problem are the sellers”

However, as a freelancer myself, I wouldn't waste my time now that I've worked with this company for a little while.

They take a minimum of $1 out for each gig, including extras, tips - you name it. Someone ordered a $20 gig from me and they still took $4, even though it was one gig sum, not 4.

In addition, you'll wait several weeks until funds clear and they'll charge you to release them. For one $5 gig, you'll end up with $3 before it's all said and done and you won't get paid for weeks.

I just wanted to put this out there.

I thought it would be a good way to earn a few bucks, but for the work you do and what you get paid (after fees), I would encourage you to not underestimate your worth.
Don't settle for this place.

717,"I have been both a buyer and a seller on Fiver and I've been disappointed both directions.  As a buyer I've had sellers who delivered just horrible quality then got mad when asked to make it right.  One even filed a complaint against me when the product he delivered wasn't even close to what he'd promised and I refused to pay.   Another did such a low quality job that I think my kid could have done better.   I understand I won't get much for $5 but in my case I offered more in exchange for better quality and the quality was still low.

As a seller I find there are very few orders and the site is a bit hard to navigate.  Just try to find your own ""gig"" for example, even from your admin pages, to do edits.

My customers have liked my products and I've gotten ""tips"" on sales which in many cases doubles my income.  The problem is the fees charged eat it up.  Let's say I have a $5 item and I get a $5 tip so I made $10 from the sale.   But then Fiver charges me $2 in their fees plus an additional $1 to send me my money via PayPal. If I want it sent any other way the fees are higher, in some cases MUCH higher.    So Fiver is taking 30% of my gross income on the sale!

If I'd made the $5 sale and NOT gotten a tip they would have taken $3 of the $5 I was paid.   Making $2 for an item isn't profitable.

In the ""Price-Quality-Service, Pick any two"" equation you're getting a very low price, but I'm just not seeing that you're getting either of the other two.  When you only get one of the three items it's a bad deal and should be avoided.  That's my advice for both buyers and sellers... Avoid it.",2,"“High fees, questionable sellers” "

724,"If you believe that you are going to get high-quality work for $5, then you are sadly mistaken.    As another reviewer said, choose your provider carefully. I've used Fiverr on five different occasions and each time, I have been disappointed. 

The quality of the work was okay.  The ability to offer work for $5 comes from the fact that providers are rehashing the same content over and over again.  If you want something that requires more work, you will pay more. However, there is a limit to what some will do. 

Many seem to operate on a Walmart mentality, preferring 100 customers paying $5 over a client who pays $50, so don't expect to pay your way to a better outcome.  Based on my experience, the providers I came in contact with were focused on quantity, not quality. And hey, for $5, what do you expect? Even with the service add-ons, which can push you into paying hundreds, don't assume everyone will provide quality service.

One of the things I don't like about Fiverr is that you never get your money back. If you pay a provider for a service and something happens where the service is cancelled or undelivered, FIVVER KEEPS YOUR MONEY FOREVER. The only way to access your money is to hire another provider, and that provider's service must add up to the exact amount of your account credit. If the amount differs, Fivver will charge you again and ignore any credit you may have.

Their customer service is almost non-existent.  Expect to wait 2-3 days before you get a reply, if you get a reply. If you even dare to fill out a customer survey detailing a negative encounter with a rep, expect an email from that same rep telling you why they did what they did. Nightmare.

I'm not saying to run from Fivver.  I like Walmart. Even though I hate shopping there at times, I can't resist the bargains. I feel the same way about Fiveer. 

There are some decent Fivver providers who will deliver services that you can't get for $5 in any market. Just make sure you read Fiverr's terms of service, and thoroughly vet the service provider before paying any money. Remember, your money will NEVER come back to you.  Therefore, proceed with caution.",2,“You get what you pay for! And Fiverr keeps your money forever!”

That's bad enough, and as a freelance writer with 20 years-plus of dedication and passion and new learning in the field, I'm turning more and more ""EULA copy-n-paste companies"" down, whether a buyer or a seller and regardless of what they are selling or how bad I want it.

Fiverr(TM) stays pretty even -- having rewritten the EULA to a point where they aren't taking everything -- at least on the surface. That was well done. However, scroll way down to the bottom and you see this cute little statement that says that ""they can use content for marketing purposes -- or any other purpose"" -- that screams third-party vendors and absolute intellectual property control, even though they say earlier that the buyer gets intellectual property. I'm good with that latter part. If I ghostwrite, or do an edit for a client on a business document or thesis/dissertation, then I expect, since I was paid as a contractor, not to retain any rights. Fiverr(TM), however, has made it clear that they can use any portion for any purpose. That means the company owns your work that you either created as a seller, or contracted as a buyer. In essence, Fiverr(TM) gets everything for free in terms of content, and still charges fees.

I thought it would be a good and simple way to make some cash on the side while honing some skills. WRONG. The type of buyers on that site, I have found, expect a whole lot out of your for so little pay. You can increase the price on each service you are selling, which makes sense, but most buyers don't even bother to read and expect your highest level of service for $5. Then fiverr has not even given you the functionality to upgrade to the level your buyer needs!! You are stuck with doing high level job for $5 unless you can convince your buyer to buy another level service. The mobile site is even worse. It has about 30% of the features on the website. Terrible. How are you supposed to do your business in a timely manner, like they repeatedly hound you to do, if their mobile site is less than functional? They also send you a lot of annoying emails. You can opt out of some such as the marketing emails, but if you have a buyer who doesn't respond after a few days, fiverr will repeatedly send you emails everyday to say you need to ""work on your job"" and not to leave your client hanging. Its even worse when you've gone past your deadline for reasons out of your control. That is BS and way too many emails. Once you've finished your job, you only get 80% of your payment. So if you work for $5 you are actually getting $4. I did at least 5 jobs and only ended up with $32. Not worth my time. The site is not intuitive at all. It is way too complicated for a site that sells $5 jobs. I really feel like there is too much extra ""stuff"" that gets in the way of navigating the pages and understanding your profile and gigs. Also, anytime you'd like to make a change, a payout, or anything other than adding a new ""gig,"" they make you confirm with an email. So, you have to wait for the email to come, which isn't right away, just to make simple changes or get your money. Overall, I had 10x the headache than reward with this site.

That said - the reason I would NOT recommend use of Fiverr is because since I have used it, the credit cards I used on the site were hacked.  None of my other cards have been hacked; just the ones I used on Fiverr.

This person could easily have bought the fake followers and then charged everyone else $5 to tweet to essentially non-existent people.  WATCH this site.  Be very careful.",2,“Very mixed bags” 
736,I ordered two gigs from different sellers. The first was not delivered as promised and seller would not repsond to me to correct it. It is RIDICULOUSLY confusing to figure out how to even request your money back or submit a complaint. I understand that the integrity comes down to the seller but the website obviously feels no obligation to ensure people are getting what they order OR to allow for REAL reviews on each seller because if you cancel or reject your order - guess what? You arent able to review the seller anymore. Irresponsible.,2,“I ordered two gigs from different sellers” 
737,"I am a seller there for 6 years now. I was a 2 stars seller in the last 4 years.
They have strict rules and most often penalize correct sellers for absurd reasons. You have no control in refusing dishonest buyers.

Their new ranking system is awful... because of one single Mutual canceled order and no negative feedback (it has happened to be sick and unable to work), i was demoted from 2 stars seller to ZERO!

Tip for buyers: You can find good sellers if you know how to choose...",3,“As a seller I think is ok” 
738,"Up until earlier this year I was an avid Fiverr user.  I spent a lot of money using various Sellers and their fabulous talents. One thing I did notice though is that the management are less interested in the Buyer than they are of the Seller.  I dont understand this because without the Buyers, Fiver would not be able to operate.  Everyone in business knows that the person paying you money to do a job or buy a product, should be treated with respect and sooner than later.  This is NOT the case with Fiverr.  Well, more often than not anyway.  In saying that, there are some incredible talent on Fiverr

So getting back to my question.  What's happened to Fiverr?  I went on the site this week only to find that most of the Sellers (Artists, Writers, etc) have left Fiverr.  I also noticed that the number of Sellers per category is nowhere as many as there used to be!!  

Another problem I have is that my original account with them, I could not for the life of me get back into.  It kept telling me that my server needs updating.... hmm, so I opened a new account, new name, new password and yep, got in.  How many people/buyers are they losing because of this?  Still waiting for them to fix it but not much luck.    If you are about to use Fiverr? Be careful.  Some of the sellers (not all, I have dealt with courteous, polite and honourable people mostly) can be rude, and try to con more money out of you.  Over all Fiverr is a good site, not great, but good.  :)",3,“What's happened to Fiverr???” 
739,"Are there only Indian and Kenyan people? I mean I was looking for American and was totally unlucky with that. However, prices are cheap which is good. Support Team is also great. I am looking for another service.",3,“Feel like 50/50” 
740,"I used Fiverr for assistance with a few smaller jobs. Some gigs were helpful.  Some were not.  But when I needed assistance with a larger job building a wordpress site, the experience was timely and costly. The seller asked me to review and complete the order before the work was done (this is a common problem on this site). Doing this means the job is complete and the seller is no longer obligated to finish the job.  This seller attempted to communicate with me on my social media sites rather than on Fiverr. I didn't allow this.  I wasn't able to use the wordpress website I ordered due to poor programming. This was partially due to a language barrier and several misunderstandings. This was frustrating because when I ordered the job, it was stated English was spoken fluently.  When I left an honest review the seller harassed me until it was changed. It was highly unprofessional from a person claiming to have experience along with education in this specific area.  

I feel some sellers on this site offer a good product.  And I have had very positive experience with some sellers on Fiverr.  But, the site does not appear to check sellers backgrounds. I don't feel it's a safe site to use for assistance other than with small, basic jobs.",3,“Good for small jobs.  Can be costly for others.”

743,fiverr to me has improved alot during the past year in terms of banning sellers ..etc I will recommend to anyone now. especially sellers.,3,“Has improved” 
744,"I have been using fiverr for over a year now and it has both good and bad sides. First the good: it is easy to make an ad to offer a service and you do reach a large audience. Second the bad: they police the ads and aren't clear which section to put them in. If you don't get it right your ad will be removed. No one would have any trouble going to the right category if they would just tell you what it is, but they don't...
Second bad: you can't just delete an email because the system will mark it as a non-reply. That's where things get truly ridiculous, because sometimes all an email is is SPAM. Beginning sellers won't know this, so they delete an email and poof, your response time is shot to hell. Don't bother contacting customer service, because that is where this platform really reaches zero starts... they suck. Better just wait out the month, because then the scores will reset themselves.

On buying services: quality varies wildly, so you have to be careful what you buy. I have bought services I loved and services that had no use because the seller didn't carry out the work correctly. In the end it all comes down to 'do I want to spend a little more to get better quality'?",3,“I'm a bit on the fence about this one” 
745,"I was not expecting to see so many people saying what I thought regarding how this site has changed over the past year... but I supposed I am not alone.

749,"Fivver is one of those site where you have to take small steps in using a seller. After using fivver a few times, I relized that $ 5.00 gigs was the bare minimum service for most sellers . The more you want done the more it's going to cost.  Yes, there are some sammer on there, but you have to order with caution. When working eith a fivver seller, know what you want. Be able to communicate that in great detail with seller. If you don't give detail of your project the seller want  know what your project needs are. Communication is the #1 key factor in using fivver.  When a seller doesn't deliver on time or communicate with you, cancel the order and try someone else. It's nothing lost, because fivver will refund your account. You then take your refund and try another seller. 
Over the past couple of years since I've been using the service, I have had some good 5 star service and serveal canceled orders. But overall, I have found fivver to be a great business tool for those who work on a small to no budget. With anything shop with caution. Some of the thing I've had done: 
1. Business phone line greetings
2. Facebook advertisement
3. Flyers
4. Logos
5. Fundraiser Donation letter
6. Product mockup
7. Product package design 
And more",3,“FIVVER IS A GREAT BUSINESS TOOL” 
750,"1 negative review can lead you to do not sell your services, this is simply wrong .",3,"“Ratings and commission sucks, but good way for startup” "
751,"Fiverr has given me both some good experiences, and some bad experiences. My industry is book publishing, so I mainly deal with editing, proofreading, artwork and translations. I will list the good and bad and let you make your own opinion.

THE GOOD:

-the way gigs are set up, you have an idea, before you inquire, how much your job might cost.

-the star-ratings give you an idea if other buyers had a good experience.

-easy payment options through your credit card or Paypal.

-transfers the payments automatically into foreign currencies so you don't have to walk around with a calculator or deal with the daily currency fluctuations around the globe.

-I've had some really positive experiences on Fiverr and met some great, hard-working sellers.

THE NEUTRAL:

-Fiverr doesn't hire or screen their sellers. The rating system is crowd-sourced by other buyers. It's possible to game the system with reviews.

-You get what you pay for. Seriously! If somebody is charging far less than others for the same job and isn't a brand-new seller, it should send up a red flag. On the other hand, if somebody is brand-new, you may or may not want to take a chance on them. Give them a SMALL job, see how well they do, before you hire them for something more important. 

-There is a 5% processing fee on top of whatever you gig-cost is which is not clearly spelled out. Once you get bitten, you learn to incorporate it in when bidding on an offer. It's not an unreasonable fee, especially since you are often dealing with credit card merchant fees or foreign currency conversion fees. It's the lack of transparency to spell it out beforehand which makes this 'meh.'

-Fiverr doesn't differentiate between 'quickies' and professional-grade work. For example, if I need ad-copy quickly translated for a quick $5 gig, that work is different from a job where the translator converted a 150,000 word novel. And yet both count as a single rating with the same weight. That could be improved so the truly great sellers rise to the top. It would also help me, as a buyer, because when I contract for a big job, I want to know the person did similar work. I dunno ... maybe REQUIRE a longer survey for bigger jobs, send a 'REVIEW THIS' email followup with specific questions?

THE BAD:

-sellers are heavily skewed toward people who want to make a quick buck doing lots of quick $5 gigs, so if you have a larger job, you might end up with a lot of people who are flaky.

-You get a lot of amateurs on Fiverr, people who bid on a big job, and bit off more than they can chew. But that doesn't show up in the ratings except you may notice lots of 'not delivered on time - cancelled.' Always look through the reviews, try to discern what kinds of jobs people did before you buy.

-If you cancel your order, Fiverr keeps the money in your 'account.' They don't refund the money. You have to use it for another gig. Now this isn't necessarily a deal-buster for a small job, but when you work like I do with larger scale translations totaling hundreds or thousands of dollars, it's a bad business policy. It discourages me, as a buyer, from bidding out larger jobs on Fiverr.

-For a job such as translations, where the buyer is completely at the mercy of the translator to do an accurate job, there are a LOT of shysters on Fiverr who simply cut-and-paste your document into GoogleTranslate or BabelCube and you have no way to know unless you hire an independent editor to do a second pass-through. Again, for me, as somebody who would LIKE to bring bigger jobs to Fiverr (totaling thousands of dollars per job), it gives me pause in using them for the bigger jobs.

-Due to the quick timeframe when you are expected to pay the seller after delivery and then rate them, by the time you realize you've found a second set of eyeballs to proofread your work and realized you've gotten a translation that is so bad you cannot use it at all, there is no way to go back and make it known in the crowd-sourced ratings.

-What gets RATED is essentially 'did this seller deliver on time' and not QUALITY of the job.

-If the seller needs more time to finish the job for a legitimate reason and you want to GIVE them that time to extend the deadline, Fiverr doesn't have a way to create a mutually extended deadline. It's either cancel the job (in which case the seller gets dinged on their reviews) or hold your breath and hope they deliver it after you've already paid for it.

-For translation and editing, MOST sellers advertise they'll give up to 'x-number of revisions' for a writing/translation gig. However, for the most part, when I've gone back to these sellers to get the revisions (usually simple stuff, the proofreader spotted some typos or grammatical errors) they essentially disappear. There is no way to rate the 'follow up' rate or enforce it.

-Fiverr sellers have an unofficial 'blacklist' for buyers who leave a negative review for shoddy work. So you will find, after leaving a negative review, no matter how shoddy the work was, that all of a sudden your quote-inquiries don't get answered, or they'll get answered, but then a few hours later the seller will back out of the work. As a businesswoman, I expect to get what I paid for. I am very flexible and reasonable.

THE SUPER-INEXCUSABLY BAD:

-If you have money leftover in your account, you can only USE that money if you hire a gig for the EXACT SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY OR LESS. So if you cancelled a gig for $45 because the seller failed to deliver, but the more competent guy you hire to replace him wants $50 to do the job, you have to PAY ANOTHER $50 FROM SCRATCH and can't use that $45 sitting in your account, which you already paid the fees for, plus $5. This is outright stupid bad business policy. Seriously?",3,“A mixed bag...” 
752,"I used fiverr a lot of times, tried different sellers/gigs and had both positive and negative experiences
Positive. A lot of sellers, various and very interesting gigs, cheap cost - 5 bucks for everything. And easy to cancel the order if seller failed to deliver on time
Negative. A huge number of scam sellers. My examples, I bought 500 twitter subscribers from US but got only 200, mainly bots and part not from America.

I have made an decent amount of profit here, despite the fact that Fiverr takes $1 from every gig that is ordered.
Which means that you are technically earning $4 a gig, and NOT $5. So they should kind of change their site name, but four-rr would have sounded dumb so they went with Fiverr.

You also get hit with the Paypal fee when you withdraw your money, so I recommend letting your money accumulate and withdraw it when you have a lot of money. That way you aren't hit with EXTREME paypal fees. It's a better option than getting a check mailed to you for a $5 fee. RIP OFF.

I also hate that when I cancel a gig I paid for, they give the money back to you as Fiverr credit and if you try to withdraw it, you get hit with a paypal fee, so it's technically taking money away from you. Might as well spend it on some other gig.

Most of the buyers are great. The site is easy to use and I have a consistent stream of business. They could use a better vetting system. There are a lot of people who are unqualified in my category. They're easy to spot though. Just look for grammatical and spelling errors in their gig description. Also, always reverse image search their profile pic to see if it's a random stock image. 
If you take the time to search through sellers, you can get a really great value. I recommend always starting with small $5 or $10 gigs first before jumping into big projects, and if you buy writing, make sure to manually type the content into both grammerly's plagiarism checker and copyscape. Some sneaks do some fancy coding tricks to make stolen content pass copyscape, so if you copy/paste it will pass. 
All of that might sound pretty scary, but you have to understand it's just a platform. The sellers don't work for Fiverr, they're just using Fiverr as a platform. There are sneaks and crooks everywhere. But you can also find some awesome sellers who do great work at a great value.

I'm writing from an honest and trained seller's point of view. Fiverr has ups and downs. It is true that at least 2/3 of the clients are looking for dirty cheap prices that no professional would offer to work for. And, there's probably a bunch of sellers who are doing sloppy work to cater to those clients. This is mostly to be blamed on those clients who think they can get hours worth of work for $5, just because its called Fiverr. Having said that, Ive had wonderful clients on this site and built relationships that lasted for years. What I like about Fiverr is that this platform still has that balance between the number of jobs offered and sellers, at least in my field. If I send an offer, I usually get contacted unlike in other sites where I see 30-50 bids on a few projects. One down side I experienced is that its algorithms are unforgiving. If I paused a gig or mutually cancelled an order (which often happens when sellers put orders for $5 expecting work of 10 times more value), my gigs will take a nose-dive until a past client starts an order with me or until I find a client to work with. They must fine tune these hidden score systems to work more intelligently. Overall, my experience has been positive so far.",4,“It's not bad for the serious freelancer.”

It took a few days, but someone purchased my gig twice and left two five-star reviews. From there, more work and good reviews (and more work) started pouring in. Fiverr really saved my life quite a few times and there was a point during which I relied on it as my sole income. Yes, there are some fradulent sellers (and buyers), but it is not everyone. Most major platforms like this suffer from that, even sites like Ebay and Amazon. To avoid being scammed, it is easiest to contact a seller first and go with your gut on it. Don't fall for anything suspicious. Check out their reviews, ratings, and profile details. It is really helpful. There are always legitimate sellers out there who depend on the business that Fiverr brings in.",4,“My Review”

788,"Just like with any other service, you need to check who is working on your order. I've had cases when works were good, and I've also had cases when works were bad. So first check who you work with before placing your order. This is excellent value for this money.",4,“They are good enough” 
789,"I've bought many times in different sections. From art to voiceover and web design. The sellers are really professional and have lots of reviews, the community is active and supportive in reviews. I see small sellers get a few reviews and take off like crazy. And the people love their jobs- there's a blog sharing about it. I've never had any issues with Fiverr. I've done freelance work online and Fiverr offers a much easier platform for new beginners than many freelance bidding sites- which are much more competitive and far less personal.",4,"“Great Community, Quality Sellers, Easy to Rise Up” "
790,"Maybe I'm bias because I'm a seller on Fiverr ($4k earned in January 2016).  However, most of the user reviews I saw on this site are coming from people who seem to need to be better at reading comprehension. I've never had Fiverr not pay me.  I have also purchased many gigs on Fiverr and have had 1 or 2 not go perfectly well, but a simple modification request to the seller was all it took to get them to correct the problem.

FOR SELLERS..
For new users, payment can be delayed 2 weeks (potentially up to a month, it's been awhile since I was a new user). They are VERY transparent about the payment system and you can even see exactly when the money is available for withdraw.

FOR BUYERS..
Use some common sense before bidding on a professional service. Ask for their portfolio (if it's web design, graphics, writing, etc).  Ask what specifically is included in your purchase.  Fiverr cannot force you to accept a seller's work, so if the work done is not what you were expecting, request a modification and the seller must work with you to make it right.  Again, read the terms on the site and utilize the tools available instead of calling it a scam.",4,“Fiverr is legit” 
791,"Most of the services offered are legit. Some are scammers, but at least Fiverr protects you from shady services.",4,“Good offers” 
792,"Unfortunately, most of the reviews on here are for the independent sellers on the website instead of for the actual website. Fiverr can not control what the sellers do and you should all be aware of this. If you have a bad experience with a seller or buyer, don't blame it on the site. Report them to customer service instead!

I've been on Fiverr since October 2015 as both a buyer and a seller and have never had one bad experience. As of today, I've made $300+ on the site by offering my proofreading, editing, and writing services. Nobody has ever tried to trick me out of the money they were supposed to pay me, and no seller has ever lied about their services or tried to give me less than what they were offering.

I'm giving them 4 stars because I dislike the fact that, for sellers, they take $1 from every $5 you make. I understand that the site has to make money to keep offering themselves as a platform for freelancers, but I think they take too much. I also dislike the fact that it takes funds over two weeks to clear.

PROS
+Sellers can accept custom orders
+Sellers can set their gig to vacation mode if they're going to be away
+Buyers can cancel their order and get a refund if the gig is late

CONS
+If you buy something and don't like it, you can't get a refund",4,“Great site!” 
793,"To be honest, all of you 1 star reviewers complaining nonstop makes me sick. 

This site is WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT. 

I am an illustration seller, and an artist on fiverr. I have over 100 positive reviews, and ONE negative one. I go out of my way to make sure every client is satisfied with the work I do, and I offer free revisions on the work till they are happy. 

Not all artists post clip art claiming it is their own (I forget the name of the reviewer I saw earlier claiming this was the case, and even if I did care to find the name it would be unprofessional to call him out despite his pathetic comment), some are legitimate and talented artists offering their services at a bargain rate to gain exposure because they are just starting out and developing a client base. 

If you get scammed on Fiverr.. it is YOUR OWN FAULT. talk to a seller first. Vet them, see if they are responding in a timely fashion, if they can give you a portfolio to look through, if they can link you to their own website etc etc etc...

In the end Fiverr is just a tool to pair clients with sellers... hating the site and the sellers because YOU were too STUPID to be careful and do your homework is like blaming craigslist because you got scammed while buying a car. Wake up, grow up, and start using your head. Fiverr is a decent site that like any other has scum bags in the shadows but offers solid opportunities to hardworking and legitimate people.",4,“Enough complaining. This site is what YOU make of it.” 
794,"Fiverr.com is the site where one can order or complete various tasks for different amounts of money. The prices range from $5 to hundreds of dollars, and the tasks can be anything: writing blog entries, translating, creating company logos, advertising a product, or creating a personal postcard for someone's loved one. The website is perfect for those who need part-time jobs, but one can also make a good amount of money on Fiverr alone. 

The downside of this website is that you have to wait for 15 days to withdraw your funds. Also, Fiverr takes 1/5 of your payment as a fee. So if your service costs $5, you will get only $4 dollars back. It's nice to keep it in mind when deciding on a price. This is the only reason why I am giving this website 4 stars, and not 5. The fee could be a bit lower, and the withdrawal period should definitely be shorter.",4,“Love this microjobs site!”

Beware of sellers who do not communicate with you or ask for your email and instruct you to send monies to THEIR Paypal acct. My best advice is to do your homework. Don't spend $5 until you have checked the reviews and made sure the seller is legit. If you cancel an order, your $5 will still need to be spent on the fiverr.com site.  Hey, have some fun. Have someone write you a poem, create a tag line, make you laugh, cheer you up or write your name with fruit!",4,“I think this is a great idea”

809,"I'm both a seller and a buyer on fiverr.com. As a buyer you have to be cautious because there are a lot of scammers on the internet, not just on this site. Most will pull the same scam, offer you an unbelievable deal with a few days completion. They then send you a job completed notice, but in the text say they have started. If you respond without first clicking the button to say you have a problem, you will have accepted that the order is completed. What you need to do it click ""Reject Order"" if you do not get what you ordered, or you're suspicious of the seller's promise to deliver when he or she says it is done. That way the seller either delivers or you get your money back. Also, if you stick with Level 1 sellers or above, avoid sellers that have sold nothing, and stay clear of sellers with a rating of less than 90% positive ratings, you will be OK. 

As a seller, you have to be careful to always produce what you say you will, by the deadline you indicate it will be done. If you don't, you may have your account downgraded to a lower approval rate of suspended completely. 

I read a lot of poor reviews sighting customer support communication as a problem. This is my one area of contention with fiverr.com, they're slow to respond sometimes, but do so eventually. Unfortunately, if you are trying to report a con artist abusing their service, this delay can give the cheaters days to victimize more buyers.

Fiverr.com is far better than most micro-job sites though. With one I can not even get them to fix my log in, which is never a problem with fiverr.com. I am told an email was sent with my new password, but it never arrives. Obviously I do not bother with that site, but I wish I could access my account to suspend the gigs. Others my beef is with the delays in payment for gigs I sold. So far all have paid, but whenever they get around to it. Fiverr.com has always paid me instantly once I did request funds be transferred. As well, all monies owed me were refunded money for gigs that I rejected or were not done on time immediately. 

I only ranked the site 4 stars out of five only because they really need to improve their communication, and because every few days there seem to be technical glitches. None serious, but with the poor communication, glitches too are enough to cost a star in my opinion... But what I can not do is fault this company for scammers abusing their service. Crooks online are everywhere, and as long as they are suspended once found out the website owner has done all they can. Anything online is a case of.

In reading more reviews and complaints about Fiverr: I won't say Fiverr support are angels, because that's untrue. Make sure you're paying a reasonable amount for what you're going to get, and maybe you'll get higher quality sellers.  If you go to Fiverr thinking you can get a whole novel edited for $5  only $4 of which goes to the seller, what do you expect the quality of the work to be?  You have a huge pool of talent, and the more talented people are going to demand a better price for their work.  You do truly get what you pay for.  if you think that Fiverr staff are terribly motivated on behalf of $5 buyers who are out to rip off sellers, you're probably wrong.  There are many buyers who are dedicated repeat customers on Fiverr, and do large projects with sellers. I know, because I'm one of them.  And I know other people in my local business community who have built up relationships with Fiverr sellers.  Find someone, vet them, talk to them, start with a small project and then work up -- both in size of project and fee scale -- to larger projects with your trusted sellers.  It's how you create a relationship ANYWHERE in the business world.  And Fiverr and Fiverr sellers are businesspeople.",5,"“As a freelancer you have to start small and start smart, but....” "

852,"I have been a Fiverr buyer for 3 years and a seller on Fiverr for 30 days.

Fiverr is a platform where you have independent individuals (not employees) that can be very talented, at the very least saving you a lot of time outsourcing tasks at the cheapest rate.  As with any other website where you hire a freelancer, it is up to you to screen candidates before hiring them.  Fiverr protects the buyer and seller as much as possible, but you also have a responsibility.

If you buy a Gig, you can cancel if the seller does not deliver in the agreed time.  The seller has to mark the job as completed and you have to accept it or reject it.  If you don't do anything, the job will auto-close in 3 days as if you agree that it is completed. Never accept jobs that only delivers after the closing date, that does not make any sense to do that.

For Sellers, Fiverr keeps your payment for 2 weeks and takes 20%. Amazon, for example, keeps your money for 6 weeks and keep at least 30% of your payment.  They both have a clientele of ready buyers and they provide you free exposure or traffic.  

My experience with buying Gigs have been above average value for the money spent.
Yes, there were duds, people who didn't deliver, but that is a tiny percentage.  I have never lost money with Fiverr.

Like any other company, Fiverr has terms of service, most of which are common sense, such as, for sellers, no fake accounts, no fake orders and reviews for your own Gig etc.  If you ignore these, your account will be suspended.  Play by the rules, this protects both buyers and sellers.

If you're concerned that you'll lose $5 by trying Fiverr, then don't use it.  But also consider that everything new has a learning curve, you don't stop at the first bad experience, when I cancelled orders, I simply got another Fiverr user to do the job.  If you're starting a business, try and get the vision of what Fiverr users can do for you.

If you're not experienced in buying outsourced tasks or not willing to do due diligence and search for the best candidate to do the job, then this is probably not for you.  If you're a business person who values your own time, I'd love to know of another service that is available at such a low rate and high value.  Thank you Fiverr.",5,“Fiverr is excellent value for buyers or sellers” 
853,This is where I make 20 - 25 $ a day.,5,“The best” 
854,"Amazing communication. Very understanding, will work with you especially if you are new to Fiverr! Great experience",5,“Awesome work!” 
855,"If you live in the modern world you do know everything is business.  business has to charge you so much because they have a huge overhead.   what if there was a site that connected the ""consumer"" with individuals (companies ) providing legitimate services at 75-99% off.  that's right. a huge savings over the ""real world""   you may ask what's the catch?  well just like any treasure-hunt you have to glean the site and do your due diligence in order to find those quality individuals that will explicitly help you .   i have tried spreading the word to friends.. but some people just don't get the value thats inherent in this new platform for a new century.  In my opinion you can get scammed for $5 or you can score 100's to 1000's of $ value services for $5-$10 ... which will happen it's totally up to you.   I figured more people should know about this site because it is a model for the new world of how we work and get things done.  please take five minutes of your day or week and check it out.  BTw i am not affiliated in any way with the site just fyi.",5,“Why you should one look at Fiverr”

857,"I have used dozens of people on Fiverr, whether it was a video intro, a singer, song mastering, a logo, editing a blog, or a photoshop pic fix and the one time I had an issue I was refunded thanks to Fiverr because they track the progress and if it goes past the expected delivery date, they handle getting your funds back.

You cannot go wrong!",5,"“Great model, protected buyers, A+” "
858,"I have used fiverr for video greeting, birthday video, logo modification and business copy.  All experiences were executed efficiently and the product delivered was excellent in all but one situation - where the service provider was easy to work with resolving the issue.  I would definitely consider for future needs.",5,“I have used Fiverr 4 times with no problem.”

862,waw.after i join to fiverr i earn lot of money from it .still i earning money :),5,“very good site” 
863,"Awesome website and services. If you are a seller, Be honest and be patient you will gain great money. If you are a buyer, just try to chose the right seller, and understand how the website works. If you get scammed, you should contact customer support and you will get your money back within few days.

I never had a bad experience with fiverr. I work there for 5 years.",5,“Awesome website” 
864,"Select your service provider carefully. Search with key words that match your project. Be very specific in the order, almost to the point that they might not speak English. Over pay up front, tip and use the best ones again. Out of 28 projects, 2 were losers, but they tried and apologized, and the rest have been either very satisfactory or superlative. If they don't know what I want, that is my fault. Tip: write detailed instructions if possible",5,“Know how to order” 
865,"Most of the people who are complaining here are making statements that clearly show that they don't know how to use the website. Someone even says, ""The guy marked the order complete without ever turning in the work."" No. That is absolutely incorrect. The seller cannot mark ANYTHING as ""complete"". It is impossible. The ""buyer"" (or customer) must mark it complete, or the website (Fiverr) does it for you after 3 whole days. If you are placing an order, and don't bother to check your messages for up to 3 days, the order is then marked as complete. If you're spending money on a service, you should probably make sure that YOU understand how it works before you get on random websites to complain about it. I have been using Fiverr for 3 months and it is a lovely service platform... IF you know what you're doing. That's why there are FAQ and Terms of Service pages. Everyone is always trying to find someone else to blame for their ignorance and it's frustrating. Especially since every single customer has the right to ""reject"" the order if the quality isn't up to par with their expectations. Every single one. You don't HAVE to accept low quality work. But you DO have to know exactly what you're doing and not blame a website for your OWN stupidity.",5,“Most people don't understand how to use the interface...” 
866,"you can buy best social service from here facebook youtube instagram and twitter.... this seller is good for this service.... and very honestly here is his email.... i think its better from fiverr

867,I was very pleased with my book cover. I'll be hiring them to do more covers for me and eventually a web page. Anyone looking for great work at a reasonable price won't go wrong with Fiverr.,5,“My cover is great!” 
868,I don't know why the bad reviews on here.  I have used Fiverr.com since the site started.  I had over six logos designed for my various companies as well as other marketing tools linked with Facebook and twitter as well as reviews and such.  The vendors were more than helpful and most of the time I even tip them because the job was so good.  The vendors that delivered me the logos more often than not would give me anywhere from 2-11 logos for only $5.  That is a ridiculous price.  I was charged over $300 for my very first company logo from a graphic design firm.  So all in all I highly recommend choosing fiverr.com and giving it a shot.,5,“Awesome Market Place with GREAT products and vendors” 
869,"Hello :

I was about to create my moz account for about 99$ per month , i just search fiverr ""moz account"" and i find a buyer that create 4 month moz account for only 5$ yeah I buy it and my account delivred within 6 hours.

Yeah I save +300$ using fiverr thank you !!!!",5,“Hello :” 
870,I have actually had a very good experience with this site. It is a buyers beware but peer reviews can help you weed out the bad ones.

872,"Found fiverr good, have order quite a few promotions for my website and fan page, give credit where it's due and jazzy7 gave me a great package. Have also had other great sellers such as mbrown and hitace44, overall pleased so far.",5,"“Found fiverr good, have order quite a few promotions...” "
873,"I ordered 4 gigs with 4 different individuals. 3 for doing some research and one for an ebay seller site. Two researches' results were what I wanted. One researcher told me in all honesty that she did not have the expertise on that topic and refunded the money. Each of the researchers received 40$. The individual working on the ebay site was a tad on the expensive side (100$) but I got what I paid for and then some.

I have not a single bad experience and will continue to use them. This my experiences as a client. You can always find bad apples but here, fiverr comes in as mediator: If you don't like the work you should be able to get your money back since fiverr obviously (reading comments from sellers on this site) is on the buyer's side (whether fairly or not).

I had one question for customer service which was answered sufficiently within 72 hours, Good enough for me.

As a seller I cannot imagine to live off fiverr if you live in one of the high cost countries. But I can imagine that it may support you if the cost of living is low and a stream of 20$ gigs gets you somewhere. This is global trade for the little guys. Each partner wins because of the difference of cost of living of seller via buyer. I doubt that I would get what I received (quality- and quantity-wise) for the money invested locally (in the US). On the other side, I would not even consider going locally after some pricing research. I would not have progressed any further. So, I did not take someone here a job away, but added a source of income to someone who can make better use of my money.

All in all: so far I have had a very good experience as a client and will continue utilizing their service but am ready to find a bad apple or two amidst.",5,“I ordered 4 gigs with 4 different individuals”

876,"I'm surprised to find all of the one star reviews for fiverr.com.  I guess the experience can vary greatly depending on who you choose to use on the site.

I've been fortunate to have very good experiences with the majority of gigs I have purchased on Fiverr. Since SiteJabber is for reviewing the SITE, I definitely have to give fiverr five stars.  I think it's an awesome idea, and fiverr has gone a great job of organizing their interface and feedback system.  It allows you to quickly find someone offering their services and see what kind of experiences others have had with them.

I just referred my brother to them a few days ago and he has been very happy with his first experience with them.  It just so happens that he was over by my house today and brought it up in our conversation.  He had an excel program he wanted created in connection with his business and he was very happy with someone he used on fiverr to create it.  He is familiar with creating excel macros, etc. (as am I), but it's so much better to have someone do it who does it day in and day out and is able to do it much more efficiently than he or I could.",5,“I'm surprised to find all of the one star reviews for...”
