0,"I bought a box of 12 new pens from a company. When I got the pens only one would work. I wrote a unsatisfactory review on this company. I was then notified by this company, that if I would change my review to 5 stars they would send me another set of pens. I refused to lie about this company and therefore did not get more pens. If this is how an EBAY review works I am totally in disagreement.",1,ebay.com
1,"eBay member since dec, 13 1998. Bret69 is my user name. Perfect feedback. Over 100 transactions. Last thing I sold, a $1000 lathe chuck, sold for $270 and a hold was placed on my funds for 1 month. eBay expected me to pay out of pocket to ship this heavy item across the country. I needed the funds from the sale to pay for shipping. I ended up refunding the money to the seller. I spent over an hour on the phone with them trying to get the $27 transaction fee reversed and was told the buyer had to initiate the cancellation of the transaction, which I have since learned is not true. I put a block on my bank account and now ebay is continually harassing me over non payment. They won't ever get a dime from me. DONT EVER TRY AND HOLD BRET TAYLORS MONEY!",1,ebay.com
2,"Ebay protect its seller, 2009shoppingmall ( 157161 ), to deceive consumers by buying good reviews by lying to her consumers that she will return their money if they re-write the review to good. If consumers rewrite the review, she close the access of review, but does not return any money. Must under ebay helps, this seller controls the access of review all the time. A buyer can get the review link only after they receive items. The link will complete shut off after reviewing. But the seller or ebay will reopen it only buyers agree to rewrite good one under the seller's lie returning money. Otherwise, consumers never have the access to review her product. That review access control by sellers for their benefits through website operation under ebay website indicates that ebay involves in the deception. I also need to mention the seller, 2009shoppingmall (157161), uses misleading language to deceive consumer by calling the toy room dividers (big as a book) as room dividers. If consumers do not check the size or not familiar with size unit, they will buy it because they take the item as real room dividers. She just know people will return the item for paying mailing back to China. Even though ebay says that consumers can return free, but you will get charge for packing. And the seller usually sell not too expensive item, so buyers will not real send back. The seller is China even though she used English name email me. I came from China. I saw too many similar deception in China. Most of sellers deceive buyers like her. Remenber her selling user name: 2009shoppingmall (157161)! She may change it after finding my review here. She sells ""6 Panel Screen Room Divider Fabric Wood Frame Folding Partition Privacy"". I sell picture her products and her email asking I rewrite review! I am glad I did not lie it.",1,ebay.com
3,"Not even free diamonds. Buyer grossly misrepresented Item & shipping price. It took over a month for the item to arrive. eBay asked me to pay for the return shipping. Seller got defensive, then nasty, then threatened me. When the seller predictably pretended like he never received the item (despite my receipt of shipping) seller got defensive, then nasty, then threatened me. When seller predictably pretended like he never received the item (despite my receipt of shipping) And kept Over $65 of my money, eBay was okay with this, even complicit, because it is within their assinine policies. Their policies are consistently protective of their frequently disreputable sellers. This is not my 1st experience with their worst customer service on earth. It will be my last. Save your time, money, & sanity: Do business elsewhere.",1,ebay.com
4,"I purchased a motor through eBay for my Mini. The seller had listed the motor incorrectly and refused to provide a return ticket. To add insult to injury he was also very harassing via email. I sent him proof that the motor was incorrect and he still refused to provide shipping. eBay determined the motor was listed incorrectly and promised a full refund. I have yet to receive it and it's been a month. eBay tells me that I have to now fight with PayPal but I cannot submit a dispute through PayPal bc I did not purchase the item though PayPal. I cannot repair my vehicle bc I've not had a refund of my funds. I even offered to send the motor back when the refund was processed although eBay said I didn't have to and even though this seller was very belligerent. My advice is: Find someone else to purchase your parts through bc this company does not stand by their guarantees and warranties. I let him know the day we received it that it was incorrect. I'm still fighting to get someone to adhere to the policy and guarantee that I was provided upon purchase. It has been very difficult being without a car for so long and very a very difficult and extremely long process to get this corrected. It may not mean much to eBay and this seller but my car is the only transportation I have for myself and my son. My hope and prayer is that nothing emergent happens to either one of us or our pets while I'm waiting on this to be resolved bc we would be out of luck. I think it's a sad day when large companies do things like this to people - all people. For those of you that read this review, please pray for our family. Being without a vehicle bc of this company's refusal to uphold their policies is nerve racking and upsetting.",1,ebay.com

7,"I got scammed by the seller XPS Direct on the ebay platform. A Dell Alienware worth of £2k+ laptop has been advertised by this indian seller with certain specs, and he sends it away with lower specs . He was rude and ignorant and he didn't cared ahout what he advertised and what he sent .  So i asked Ebay to intervene, and they said if i don't like it i can return the item and that is that . But if i'd be doing that he'd get away with his wrongdoings and they won't be doing anything . So i asked ebay to get the seller to send a refund for the missing specs worth of value, and then i left the seller a negative feedback .  What ebay did was to remove the negative feedback, and then also closed the case with no solution provided . So i got screwed £2000 by this indian seller and ebay alltogether .

The buyer offered nearly double the opening bid price, and then sent a fake email from PayPal telling me I needed to ship the item and send a tracking number before they would release the funds. I contacted PayPal and the email is fake. EBay has no place on the site to report this kind of activity and still shows that the item sold (and they are invoicing me 10%) for $5,200.00. Seriously illegal activity. I'll take my stuff locally from now on!!! Not to mention bringing all email correspondence to the Attorney General office.",1,ebay.com
9,There is a seller on ebay openly committing fraud on ebay customers and ebay doesn't want to do anything about it. The have pointed me to paypal but they wont do anything either. Ebay is not interested in doing anything about sellers current products for sale that offer the same warranty that they are not honoring for my $2600.00 purchase. They just spin me in circles asking if they have answered my questions to which the answer is no. They just want me to go away and be quiet.,1,ebay.com

11,"Ebay linweipqq Chinese Seller Scam Scum Untrustworthy Negative Feedback This Chinese seller really got some nerves. To start with, the item wasn't as described and I have requested to send it back . We have mutually agreed that once they received the item, they will refund the cost of the item including the return postage cost. Things change when the item reach in China. I ve return the item with Royal Mail track and signed and keep the seller update with tracking number and proof of postage This seller never bother (Or don't want ) to check the item and the post tried to deliver the item for 5 days or more but no answer. ( The post leave the card for pick up ofc) I've contacted the seller for this, and only replied after repeated chasing. 1 minute after replying hi , sorry ,we not Have received it , we will go to post Office ask them ,many thanks ,The seller has opened case and ask Ebay to help in , and 15 min after that the case was CLOSED AND RESOLVED and I will not be refunded! To my surprise, what's kind of lies the seller telling ebay and what kind of gullible customer service who handled this matter without checking fact and evidence with both seller and buyer. (in this case seller only) Its been almost 2 months dealing with this, my case was closed in 30 min! I have go all to way to make this right with a lot and patience and time wasted as they did not reply and need to be chased. I don't even gave them a neutral and negative feedback as I think its only fair for both parties until this is resolved. It was very frustrating, confusing and disturbing and of course I have appealed for this matter to look at again. Fortunately, someone is a bit smarter from Ebay customer service look at it, and eventually I was refunded for item and now waiting for Paypal to refund the return postage cost.

12,The worst customer care that doesn't care about their clients and want themselves figure out the jungle their programmers setup for them. Every aspect of the company becomes worse and worse every time I tried selling on their website. More and more problems arose with every sale I was making and ebay doesn't do anything to resolve the issues that become apparent. They want to distance themselves as far as possible from the process claiming they're middleman. But they're first to make the worse decisions when scammers attack they're honest sellers. It's the worst company out there. Hopefully competition will eat them alive and take this frustration of all the frustrated customers....,1,ebay.com
13,"I noticed eBay was selling many hate books, included one that promoted murder, which is against their own policies and probably against the law, so I reasonably reported the items and complained on eBay's forum, but my thread was deleted by a moderator called li_gary who claimed it was disruptive or repetitive, which made no sense, so I closed my eBay account, and they won't be getting any more of my money. They also show a lot of misleading prices in search results, so you see a clock for $1, but when you go to the page, it's really $30, because the $1 price was for a plug adapter and not the product that is actually being advertised, and that makes it impossible to sort by price, it wastes your time, and it's just plain dishonest.",1,ebay.com

""Transition Photochromic Progressive Multi Focus Reading Glasses"", from 1st.ing, which are worse than no glasses at all and an ""ankle Protector Ankle Brace Guard Foot Support Sport"" from lalanggift, which was completely different to the one shown. You can pretty much guarantee that items listed as Sterling Silver, even when ""marked 925"", are only silver plated. It's just too disappointing. I will not bother with eBay anymore.

The buyer emailed me that they had changed their mind. Now it is too late to sell it and ship in time for Christmas, so it cost me my sale.  I tried to report the unpaid item on my phone, but it was so small as they don't have a mobile version of this part, and I accidentally cancelled the unpaid item report. I called them and had to wait 10 minutes. They told me they can't created another unpaid item report and would manually refund my final value fee. This took another 20 minutes. They then threatened me saying that this is a one time courtesy and I shouldn't mess up again when it was clearly the buyer's fault for bidding on something they didn't want to pay for and their fault for not having developed a mobile version of this part of their site and making it so easy to make a mistake and then making it impossible to undo the mistake.  I asked if there is anything else they could do after explaining the situation and they said no I would just need to relist. Now I am out a sale and have to wait for a refund of the fee and do not have any other chances to make a mistake. There are much better selling platforms out there these days so why bother with ebay.

Even Amazon at least took steps to amend the situation, even though it took a lot of time and headache on my part.

However, a buyer had already made a bid and sent money, even after my husband had said the item was no longer available. He was completely upfront with both the buyer and eBay, and did not accept the money. Ultimately, the guy got his money back...no harm, no foul, right? Wrong. He filed a case with eBay and they took $103 out of our account. When my husband contacted the website, it was a customer service nightmare. Every email was from a different representative, and every time he thought he had answered the questions and sent them the proof they asked for, they would say that they needed ""more information"". They also kept claiming to not be able to view the files, and told my husband to post them using photo sharing sites that were not free. They had said they would keep the case open for five days after that, but not even two days later, informed him that they would not issue a refund to us.  Taking $103 from us for a sale that never happened...I believe the word for that is thievery. This is in addition to fees they charged for using the site.

This morning when about to buy an expensive table saw with one voucher, and something else with the other voucher, (as they came in two separate vouchers) I find eBay have removed them!

The amount of problems I have had with them over 15 years is ridiculous! But most of the problems of this kind in the last few years, they have gone right down hill.

Went to that address and it was a business with a ""Thomas"" in package receiving, but he doesn't remember if he signed for it or not. Not to mention that I have a ring doorbell as proof that I didn't receive it. Tried to get Ebay to step in and help, and they wouldn't do anything about it. I'm done with ebay! Too many scams these days! And, Ebay is letting scammers use their site. I'll cut my loses and use the mall!!",1,ebay.com
50,"Ebay sends a request to ""help: consumers after each purchase by rating the transaction. BEWARE! What they do NOT tell you is that if you actually do give a fair appraisal- you probably will no longer be sold to! Many companies request that you contact them FIRST before giving anything but a 5 star rating. This program is a FARCE! This happened to me. When I contacted E-bay, they said it was not their ""problem"" and that the vendor was free to sell to whoever they choose. I will no longer aid E-bay in their efforts (in rating products or services). E-bay's true allegiance is truly only to themselves- NOT the customer!",1,ebay.com
51,I didn't receive my package and the seller tried to extortion me into giving them a positive review to get my item and then again to get my money back and I asked eBay to step in and they didn't care they said the package shows delivered and closed the case so they don't guarantee your money back now out my package and my money thanks eBay and nothing was done to the seller for trying to extortion me into giving them a positive review and again thank you eBay and it's against eBay rules to extortion people and is illegal but they don't care the seller is still selling on eBay so thanks eBay for all your worthless help,1,ebay.com
52,"Now I see you are charging .35 cents for extra listings, plus higher fees. I do not recommend being a Seller anymore on eBay. I am done. No more business buying or selling on eBay. I Notice there is no Seller Loyalty or Protection, I got Robbed on eBAY and now forced to PAY TWICE for 2 eGift Cards for $300. I am out of $600 and with my Multiple Sclerosis and Blood Pressure, I can not handle this. I am in the Red for an eBay Transaction and was basically robbed by a buyer on eBay (NOT ONLY DID I LOSE THE MONEY FOR THE CARDS THE CARDS WERE ALREADY USED) I Will Be REPORTING THIS TO THE POLICE AS WELL. The Buyer is Fraudulent, purchased 2 Gift Cards from me on eBay (Email Delivery) one eGift Card for Target for $200 and one from Kohls for $100. I am not refunding the money for someone committing Fraud. He even left me a POSITIVE FEEDBACK ON EBAY FOR THE $200 TARGET GIFT CARD. MY EBAY STATES NO REFUNDS AND USING MY TARGET AND KOHLS ACCOUNT, I DO NOT GET REFUND BACKS FOR EMAIL GIFT CARDS. SO YOU GUYS DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO AND HANDLE THIS, I AM NOT GETTING ROBBED BY SOMEONE.  I Sell and Buy for a long time with PayPal and eBay if you do not correct this you will lose my business.  Again here is your wonderful CONFIRMED Buyer who costs me $600",1,ebay.com
53,"Fixed seller Feedback review system is a joke and unethical.This site treats sellers much better than buyers as they try to release thier liability. They ALWAYS side with the seller except for refunds issued because they want someone else to pay the refund not them.

ITS A RIGGED SYTEM FOLKS!",1,ebay.com

Of course they quickly got their money. Unfortunately weeks passed by and I still had not received my product nor had the seller contacted me. I had to email them and request my product be sent. The item was to arrive no later than 8/16/18. This den of thieves lied and said my product got lost and that it should be arriving soon. Days went past and I emailed again! Finally, the item arrives on 9/1/18 only it's not the item I ordered. I hit the roof!!! This time I threatened to report them to Ebay. What a waste of time. Ebay is a den of thieving sharks and don't care if you get taken. I call Ebay stay on the phone over 2 hours being shifted from one operator to another. HORRIBLE customer service! I provide with all the emails and even the email where I threatened to report them to ""Sitejabber"".  Finally, they tell me they will contact the seller and have them send me a return label and then I get my money credited back. WTF!!! Are you serious? Do you think I wanna be shaghaied and bamboozled again? Ebay then sends another email stating the seller can't send a return label and for me to just send the item back and then I will get the credit to my account. I went completely OFF!!! Ebay and the seller not only emotionally raped me but continued the merchant abuse by trying to get me to pay to send the wrethched item back. Please beware of Ebay!!! They support thieves, hustlers, liars and criminals. They will back them and take your money and not give it back. Obvious Ebay is desperate if you can't even return $39.98 to a customer! They are corrupt and sleazy. DO NOT throw your money away to Ebay! Go to Amazon! To date Ebay has not returned my money. Ebay is the pimp and the seller is the whore or retail human trafficking!!! Should be a law against this kind of abuse!!!",1,ebay.com

Then after 2 months the battery just stopped working. Reported the situation to the seller. (https://www.ebay.com/usr/sunpower-fly) Reported the situation to ebay. Reported the situation to Paypal. I will report this situation to Nikon. (It's not a Nikon battery but they say it is.) In Europe we have a warranty of 3 years in this kind of products.

Wasn't even close in measurements...way off...Emailed carmirrorbazar..an explained that the mirror did not fit the backing plate and length/width and diagonal measurements were wrong... They had me send them pictures of front and back of the mirror with their number on it. They emailed me back and said it was the correct replacement. Had to have ebay step in to resolve the matter. Finally I got a refund to my paypal account. No pride what so ever...,1,ebay.com
64,"eBay is now like a garage sale with a bad customer service. There are lots of Chinese sellers with the defective product.

66,I have read a lot of reviews about ebay and paypal and how difficult it is for sellers especially new ones to stay afloat with a small business.  I really set my mind to becoming an ebay seller many people who I know had attempted with little success most didn't even sell a single item. I on the other hand did exceptionally well in the first 30 days or so. I thought I had found my calling . Little did I know that the worst was yet to come I will not get in to all the details. My experience is just about the same as every negitive commit made about ebay and paypal that you can read about. So with that being said I believe that ebay and paypal should be governed in some way more than they are the racket they are running should be flat out illegal. .. I have made suggestions to them about what I call NEW SELLERS GRACE AND LEINENCY PERIOD. which would allow new sellers to get accustom to the way things work before they are just CUT OFF SHUT OUT AND LEFT WITH THE BILL . I mean get real I started this business because I had no money and wanted to do something productive with my time. Instead of sitting around trying to think up some get rich quick scam I wanted that feeling of success and I thought I had found it but in turn ebay and PayPal are one sided and only care about getting and keeping your money for as long as they possibly can. I could go on for hours about how they suck and sellers should beware.... SO ANY BUYERS OUT THERE THAT ARE HAVING TROUBLE WITH THEIR SELLERS PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT EBAY AND PAYPAL MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR SELLERS,1,ebay.com

68,I did eabay for a few times in the early years and never before had a shoddy shopping experience. Often the product I ordered was defective or not to item description. If it arrived at all. This was before ebay passed a law to protect it's consumers for this experience. Customer service isn't any better. This experience was in ebay's early years. I haven't been back to ebay since.

I used to be able to search an item easily as long as each search word was in the title in any order. Most of the ebay representatives can't answer questions like this and everywhere they transfer me it is the same... It is now feeling like ebay is a thing of the past... My sales have gone down to a 10th of what they used to be.... Very sad...",1,ebay.com
71,Ebay with the fabulous creation of the ebay money garantee policy completely and arbitrary displaces the protection towards sellers. This policy allows abusive buyers that receive items in pristine condition and then claim that they received them in defective condition therefore ebay favors buyers due to its non-competent policy. Fees are extremely high 10% and paypal also establishes its fees plus shipping cost. Terrible plataform has become lately. Ebay will lose new small bussiness over time.,1,ebay.com

I said, ""Even though the original method of payment was my bank card?"" ""Yes, sir."", she said. Guess where the refund money went?  Ebay: why does EvERY little thing with you become a drama?

What was originally a great place to buy and sell as turned into a place to get taken advantage of. There are many unscrupulous buyers out there (not everyone, but MANY) who overbid an honest bidder, then refuse to pay. Of course eBay does nothing to these lowlife bidders. Then others demand refunds for clearly advertised used items because the item was not pristine. They expect to get a $200 item for $12 and expect. It be be brand new. Oh, but of course ""the customer is always right"", so the seller has to pick up the cost of shipping both ways and other expenses. I now use Amazon, Etsy, eBid, Craigslist and Letgo. These all protect the SELLERS rights. Try them out when you get screwed by selling on EBay. It's only a matter of time.....",1,ebay.com

But last week, when placing a order that contained multiple itemes, in different quantities , ebay have locked my account on account that the computer I was using was not recocnized by them; I've called Customer Suport , unlocked it, placed the order; A few days after I've found my order to be doubled ( Every item, in the same quantities, from the same vendors ; just as if you would hit the pay button, but instead of your itemes be taken from your shoping basket and the transaction to be confirmed, nothing happens, so you hit the Buy button again, but now the system registers both Buy button actions so it doubles you order). Anyway, after talking to a poor english Rep , I get a Manager ( wow , this is good, surely they should understand my problem ) ; NOPE... the Manager gave me 2 options: Try to get in touch with the selller and ask them to cancel your order, arrange for returns and wait for reffund , or sell the extrta itemes yourself ( we will get the sell fees double , not too bad for us !! ) ; They simply refused to accept any responsiblity ( a double order has never happened on Ebay , so it is not possible , she said ! ) My advice : Stay away from ebay, plenty of other options out there with less fees for seller anyway : Wish, Facebook market, OLX,",1,ebay.com

87,"Absolutely disgusting. Sellers havent got a leg to stand on even when theyre in the right. Sold an item with an accurate description but because the buyer decided she didnt like the item, I had to pay for return postage, even though in their policies it states when an item is incorrectly described the seller has to pay for return postage. I told the seller to just keep the item as Id rather not pay an extra £3 for an item I wouldnt not even receive back anyway because my old address from 2 years ago were on it, even though I changed it on my eBay account when I moved! But she sent the item back anyway, so Im out of pocket with my item, my money and postage just because the buyer decided it wasnt her style. When seeking help from eBay I was told to just go out and collect it from an eBay advisor without any concern that this may not actually be even possible? Disgusting and inconciderate.

I do bid on items now and then, as I did the other night. I won the item, and was very excited that I got such a good bargain. Ebay emails me and says ""for my protection"" they had to cancel this order. Seller no longer sells on Ebay. I called CS and get told the same. Asked if they could reimburse me somehow for my trouble, they say ""no"" However the same thing happened the next night, different buyer account and different seller. Same sort of item. They blame it on sellers, but the sellers are most likely Ebay. They just make as look as though it's someone else who is selling the merchandise.. If you ever read their ""policies"" they have rules for buyer beware. They have answers for exact questions I want to know. It must happen all the time. Then they state that if you write them reviews they can say its harassment and ban you from their site. I am pretty sure they are the scammers.

Please note that these details cover both a 30 day & 6 Month period? so will REDUCE if this bidder is inactive, and would/could go down to ZERO bid history (with seller) & zero retractions?...Umm.  Please also note that your encrypted ID? will remain the same for you for as long as you bid on the same sellers auctions...unless eBay try anymore funny business? And the encrypted ID already IN ""BID HISTORY ID""? Is the ORIGINAL encrypted bidder ID of this bidder, as seen when it WAS bidding in the SAME sellers auctions, changed (I believe) by eBay to ""muddy the water"", and protect shill bidders, and in so doing? protect it's 10% ""cut"" of any scam.

In total, from March, I had 4 items that I could not locate because of this and so I had to end the transaction, but all the while maintaining my 100% customer review. At the same time, I was able to sell items successfully although the past few months business has been slow. In the meantime, Ebay has no problem taking my money while I shop frequently. Go figure. I have called EBay twice and one rep said to try back in a couple of years while the second rep said indefinitely. I cannot believe the coldness in which this is being done as I have hundreds of listings, spent countless hours taking photos, researching and writing descriptions for each item, ALL FOR NOTHING.

105,"Been on EBay pretty much from the beginning. Been selling off and on during that time. For the past 10 been really steady selling. It was great at one time, if buyer/seller had issues Ebay would listen to both sides and make a decision. Then they started out sourcing customer service, took away sellers right to leave buyer poor feedback and then started a rule, buyer always wins!  Fraud and theft from buyers has become rampant. I would sell 10 items in a day and have 3 false complaints against me. Buyers now buy broken new items, jump on EBay looking for a new one, buy it and claim shipping damage and mail you back the broken one. FedEx and USPS will not pay for a lot of those claims, not that I feel they should. I dont even put the claim in.  Buyers are not returning items sent, they will put something totally different in the box or send a used item back, either way Ebay rules in their favor. On top of that Ebay then reduces your seller rating when you try and fight the fraudulent buyer.  In the end it became that 20-30 percent of my sales were by buyers who are looking to steal from you and they get away with it. Sellers are making a exodus and so will legitiment buyers when they can no longer find what they are looking for. So if your reading this and your a thief, Ebay is for you, if your honest seller, go to Mercari and elsewhere for better seller services.",1,ebay.com

After 3 DAYS of calling I was finally able to ship the product back. I'm still not able to log into my account.

EBay is seriously the company I hate the most on this planet. What I hate the most about them, is their customer service. Their representative are LIARS, RACISTS, UNFAIR DOUCHBAGS and will treat you like a dog if you re not a professional big seller.  Heres what they did to me recently : After 4 years of loyalty and use of their selling platform, as a seller I sold hundreds of items and had a 99,7% of positive feedback. But somehow they decided my performances as a seller were poor, and just because I canceled some of my sales for not having the item in stock anymore, they decided to BLOCK MY SELLER ACCOUNT FOREVER. Thats right, after all these years of loyalty and hard work to maintain a good positive feedback, they bashed/destroyed all my projects, plan, business on eBay just like that, without ANY PRIOR WARNING, not even a temporary restriction to start with. No, they instantly banned me from eBay for life! Can you believe this?? The worst thing is that I spent these last few years buying stuff in bulk to re-sell them later as a professional seller. I invested a lot of time and money in this company FOR NOTHING, I lost a lot of money and I am stock with lots of objects I cant Re-sell anymore! Moreover, their customer service is insanely discriminating and treat their users differently according to their influence on eBay as a seller. If youre one of the top professional sellers they will always treat you nicely and will accept yo modify a negative feedback whenever you ask them to do it. If youre just an average seller they will lie to you and say they cant do anything for you! I swear Ive got many proofs about this, happened to me many many time, They take the most illogical and absurd decisions, their follow up is complete BS since its never the same representative should replies back, they always change to confuse you and they all have the same generic, idiotic and repetitive responses, in other words youre dealing with robots, not human beings!

162,"DO NOT use ebay...I am done with them once and for all. I have been a seller and buyer for a number of years of and on because stupid stuff keeps happening and I am never covered for the lies other people fed to ebay about the situation; I'm usually the honest one. I first had a lady buy some dishes and I thoroughly packed them, when she got them somehow they all ended up broken except a plate and the mugs which she had told me before buying them that she was only interested in the mugs. In the photos she provided she showed a HUGE knife with a good sized handle that she could have used to break these dishes to get a full refund and keep the mugs. I had filed with Fedex for insurance which if you ever deal with that kind of thing it takes at least a month , but she got impatient with me and filed a claim against me requesting all of her money returned when she should have only gotten a partial shipping fee returned and partial refund on the item as she had a plate and 3 or 4 mugs. Ebay sided with her even though I went out of my way to file a claim when she should have done this...her sob story was she had cancer and needed the money, even though I was sitting there facing lyme disease and other health problems that were keeping me in bed. We had a few other similar dealing like this. Now as a buyer I am having issues with them again...I bought saddle corner plates and turns out I can't find the proper hardware to attach them to a new saddle so I contacted the seller and he immediately had ebay open a case against me and they immediately closed the case in his favor not allowing me to respond and give my side of the story. I appeal and I am still waiting on a response, this same seller accepted a return of another plate I bought from him and his lame excuse is he miss read and clicked the wrong thing. I never asked for him to pay return shipping just for my money to be refunded once the item got returned to him. After all is said and done with the mess I have on ebay...I will be boycotting them FOREVER! We have lost a lot of money selling (when we could have donated for free and not lost anything) and from buying with buyers getting away with stuff...I never have any cases rule in my favor as a buyer or seller...please be warned and do not sell or buy from them!",1,ebay.com
163,"Article 282585458333 ORDER DATE 10/01/2017. Debility system ebey, otherwise just do not describe. Well, you have to wait 4 months for FOUR and nothing to get, oh well, you saw the date of receipt, well, yes, there and the first date in two months was. I do not mind waiting for that, but two months is usually the edge, without the tracks and go. It is necessary to force the sellers to assign the track numbers, they are given for any given when sending. I can not leave a negative review to the seller, it took 45 days from the date of purchase, obscurantism, stupid and unworked site, stupid support",1,ebay.com
164,"I was with ebay for a long time and did a lot of business on there, unfortunately towards the end of my time there an awful lot of issues arose which they handled very poorly. I honestly don't know what all these buyers are talking about when they say Ebay protects sellers only, it seems to me that their whole policy is to automatically side with the buyer whenever a dispute comes up. I used to send out many deliveries and always made a point of retaining postage certificates to prove that I had done my bit and sent the item out. However, ebay is never willing to accept that there may be fraudulent buyers out there who will receive an item then claim they haven't got it so as to get their money back. Whenever an 'item not received' case was opened I showed ebay the proof of postage but all they would say was 'do you have a tracking number'. The answer was always no because tracking numbers cost so much. And guess what? They always sided with the buyer because 'there was no proof it had been delivered'. Unfortunately ebay, it is not the seller's job to ensure it is delivered, merely to send it. And given that the buyer could not prove the item hadn't arrived and I COULD prove it had been sent, i thought it was criminal to keep giving them their money back. Also, do not bother reporting other users to them- I had to report the same buyer for threats, abuse and blackmail three times and nothing was ever done. There were also multiple occasions when buyers left negative feedback even though it was clear that they had just failed to read the description of what they were buying. I spoke to ebay to ask them to remove this feedback but they said they wouldn't because 'it would be overriding the desires of the buyer'. No. It isn't. It is ensuring that I am not punished for the buyer's failure or refusal to look at what they're buying before clicking 'Purchase'. What was really laughable was when i had buyers request to return items (again, they were unhappy because they hadn't looked at the item description). And when i put this case to Ebay, and mentioned the fact that I don't accept returns in the first place, what did they do? They made me accept the return anyway!  They didn't seem too bothered about overriding my page policies. But here is the worst thing: i had to go away over the summer so was not able to dispatch orders during that period. For some reason Ebay do not let you put up a notice saying when you're away unless you're a Business page which I wasn't. But the orders kept coming in while I was away, and i spent hours messaging all buyers individually to let them know of the delay. Sadly but maybe unsurprisingly, not all of them were willing to cooperate and opened up a large number of cases against me, ignoring what I had said. This was not ebay's fault, but what was their fault was the fact that when I returned and asked ebay to close the cases and showed them that I had done everything within my power to explain things to my buyers, they weren't interested and kept all the cases open. This wouldn't have been such a problem if they hadn't put my account performance onto a 'Below Standard' setting because of the number of open cases, which means that after three months your selling privileges are permanently suspended if you can't get it back above standard. I spoke to Ebay about how to deal with this and they told me to close all the cases and that would sort it. However, this was a lie. I spent the next five weeks dealing with uncooperative buyers in order to get the cases closed and upon doing it, Ebay then said I had to mark all incoming orders as Shipped. I did this, no change. I ended up speaking to them another two or three times and each time they brushed me off with some other task to accomplish. Basically they have barred me from ever selling on ebay again because of a problem they caused, wouldn't let me rectify, and then punished me for not rectifying it. Seems fair doesn't it? But don't worry, they said I can still buy from them! I would avoid this place, it has just become a paradise for fraudulent buyers.",1,ebay.com

Ive sold over 100 items and get punished for 1 mistake.  Yet when there are glitches on their end, like not being able to checkout my cart.

If Poshmark can have a simple straight forward system, why cant Ebay?

He said he shipped the item but he did not. My payment refund became pending for 5 days. The money is being refunded in usd and not my credit card for some reason. So I lost about $65 to exchange it back to japanese yen. (Order amount is $950)  Moreover ebay suspended my account saying your actions pose threats to the community. All I did since registering is ordering this used gpu. And I used my legitimate credit card through my paypal which I have for about 10 years now. I tried to resolve the problem or at least understand why my account is suspended without any result. Ebay support simply told me to look for other auction websites. Ebay says it protects buyers but what happened here is 1. I lost my time because my money got stuck on pending for 5 days 2. I lost money because my money got exchanged to usd and not refunded back to my credit card. 3. Was not allowed to make fair feedback for the seller. Apparently the seller caused big annoyance to me and he lied that the item is shipped already so a bad feed back should be fair. But I could not post feed back due to account suspension.

If you give someone your phone number you automatically pay a final value fee, even if the item does not sell. Even if you dont know that was a violation. Even for car stuff and cars which it says you can list your phone number on their own website. If you have an issue a non US person will always tell you theres nothing they can do. They are one of the most ruthless companies Ive ever dealt with and useless for customer service. They lie, cheat, and steal. What a combination. Keep up the good work eBay. If theres anything I can hope its that Craigslist, LetGo, or an other company that does this kind of stuff keeps taking market share away from you and you become a bank with all your monetary transactions you do. Then real banks like Goldman, JP can crush you. Youve been hacked and tons of peoples information has been compromised and youve done nothing about it. No one ever was compensated for your lack of security on customers most precious personal information. eBay I just want to thank you for being the worst. Its a great example to everyone on what not to do.",1,ebay.com

I brought a action figure for 35.00 plus 15.00 shipping and never got it and didnt even received a refund. I also ordered a movie and it said the post office delivered it on Sunday. Really? The post office is close on Sundays. They was also so rude about it, even the manager. In my book, that is wrong. I am not a happy customer and I am gonna start buying from Amazon. At least, if you dont get something, they also give you credit and refund you. If I was you, I wouldn't order from them. I would go to EBay or somewhere else.",1,ebay.com
203,"I recently sold a used iPhone 6 on eBay. The listing described everything exactly as it was and I had a no return policy. This means that unless I had falsely advertised, the buyer cannot return the item. This is not something that is hidden or convoluted. However, shortly after receiving my phone, the buyer complained about issues I had listed and started something with eBay. I was forced to accept a return AND issue a full refund. I also had to pay shipping both ways. On top of that, I was charged over $20 for the return policy. Its ridiculous as I followed the rules and policies to the letter and I was cheated. Im a college student treeing to make ends meet and companies like eBay make that even more difficult. While eBay had a good start early on, they are no longer a trustworthy company.

First be aware that ebay charges the seller fees on shipping fees that are charged to the buyer for shipping products. Yes that is unbelievable with shipping fees being so high at this time to individual small business.   Second ebay allows buyers that do not pay to leave feedback for sellers but if sellers leave negative feedback for the buyer then the seller account is restricted. . Third ebay customer service is incompetant and they rarely have the answers without waiting on the line for great lengths of time to talk to a supervisor. Fourth the fees are so excessive on ebay and they push you to sell cheaper and cheaper constantly so that at some point all you work for is to pay the fees and lose money all the time on products.  i still sell on ebay and really all i want to say is FU ebay I really do not give a crap anymore if i sell anything anymore I am 62 years old and have been abused by your system for so many years that all i hope and pray is that you fail and go bankrupt you an all your incompentant moronic employees.

224,"The majority of sellers on eBay are just your neighbor, someone's mom or dad, grandparents, disabled people, just regular people selling items to keep the lights on and food on the table.  Think of how it is for you in your job when you make an error. Think about how you would like to be treated. Was the error so horrible that you deserve to have your pay docked. Was the error so bad that you deserve to be temporarily suspended. Or did you really screw up and deserve to be fired. It's no different for a seller. DSR can and do SIGNIFICANTLY impact a sellers ability to sell on Ebay. And the rules are so strict that even 2 buyers out of 100 transactions can bottom out a seller in the searches if they hit the DSRs while leaving FB.

So I make a half dozen calls and knock on some doors and no one has the package. I file a claim through eBay with zero luck. I kept getting told the same lame story over and over. So now I have to contact PayPal and see if they can do anything at all to help me out. Clearly eBay only cares about making money and not helping very very unhappy customers.

Tip for eBay appreciate your sellers more and you might attract some more trusted businesses and retailers that run to Amazon!!! Another terrible part of the eBay seller experience is the fact they take buyers word for if an item was delivered late. Well if you're providing them with a 2 day delivery time for 2nd class which is actually 2-3 working days, then they're going to think it's late!!!!!  You cannot rate a seller on their delivery times based on what buyers constitute as being late. You should only rely on the actual tracked items.

The danger for consumers is that, because of eBay's vast reach and the millions of part-time, non VAT-registered sellers, many businesses are often selling at lower prices than on their own website, despite eBay's ever-increasing charges (remember when they were about 5% and no fees on postage?). The consequence could be that in another decade or two, nearly all internet sales are handled through third party sites like eBay and Amazon. Businesses will basically no longer be independent, increasing amounts of merchandise will be banned as they are deemed politically incorrect (such as all Confederate flag items, as just one example). They will be able to set prices by setting their fees and we will only have easy access to the books they think we ought to read and the music and films we should own and the food we should eat.

I offered to re-send product, but instead of responding, they just escalated to eBay. And for this, 6 of these cases out of 670, eBay punished me by making my Global Seller Rating: Below Average. Just one case was actually in the global region, the rest were in the US/UK/Germany. I thought it won't matter since I was still a TOP SELLER in the US & UK.  WROOOONG I started selling on eBay again, subscribed to an eBay store subscription and to my HORROR I saw no one was even finding my listings!!! I couldn't find them in search either!!! eBay support repeteadly said BOGUS reasons, that it's because I'm searching my own listings, because people from other regions see other results, but that's NOT IT! Before I could find them! TURNS OUT just because my global seller status dropped below average, not only no one from worldwide can see my listings in search results, BUT NO ONE FROM THE REGIONS I STILL HAVE TOP SELLER STATUS CAN FIND MY LISTINGS EITHER !!!! EBAY INTENTIONALLY SABOTAGED AND CENSORED MY LISTINGS WITHOUT EVEN INFORMING ME BEFORE NOT ONLY PAYING $$$$ FOR MANY EBAY LISTING FEATURES TO BE SHOWN EVERYWHERE, BUT NOT EVEN INFORMING ME NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO FIND MY LISTINGS BEFORE SUBSCRIBING TO THEIR STORE SUBSCRIPTION !!!!! I tried everything, contacted them over x20 times ... NOTHING!!!! It's like they intentionally want to sabotage us! I tried to cancel the eBay store subscription and to my HORROR it wanted to charge me $94 for early termination fee !!!! FOR WHAT ?!?!?! THEY ALREADY CHARGED US $20 FOR A STORE THAT IS CENSORED AND HIDDEN AND BASICALLY FOR A SERVICE NOT PROVIDED !!!!!!!! 	I contacted Support to cancel the early termination fee, and support said to cancel my subscription and have my account charged $94 and to contacted them again for a refund. 	When I contacted them for a refund, they said I'd have to wait until next month when the invoice arrives, to ""try and request a crediting of my account and hope it gets approved"" .... TO TRY AND REQUEST ?!?!? As if it's at their discretion to commit fraud and theft for services not provided ?!?!?!?!? 	I contacted them next month, they didn't reply, had to pester them and eventually told me they're sorry they can't refund me anything because my account has been credited last month, when in fact ebay support specifically said they won't credit me anything for my listing fees for listings which were censored intentionally without informing me before hand !! And after that they dared to say ""we value your business and as an eBay seller"" and wishing me good health ---- simply outrageous and insulting !! So what happened: Even though support said they won't credit me anything for the listing fees, seems someone intentionally credited my account without informing me a measly $0.61 (61 cents) just so they'd have an excuse not to refund the illegally and fraudulently charge of $94 for an early termination fee of an eBay store that was CENSORED and useless TO BEGIN WITH !!! eBay fraudulently charged me $114 for services which they intentionally DID NOT PROVIDE !!! eBay sabotaged my business and nearly bankrupted me if it wasn't for Amazon ... killing my future and future businesses I would go and create. eBay lied, stole and abused at every turn eBay shouldn't have restricted my ability to sell in the US & UK regions since I still had and have top seller status there, or at least they should have informed me before hand !!!! BEFORE comitting to spend money!!! 	I went to BBB to no avail, they're useless and eBay just gave me copy-paste templates. More so, I suspect going to BBB is what triggered them to intentionally sabotage me further by crediting my account with $0.61 just so they'd have an excuse not to refund the illegal charges. 	They then proceeded to threats that if I don't pay they'll send collection agencies ...  	They limited my account and put it on hold. 	I paid their fraudulent $117 charge (they put penalties on it) and asked for my account to be reinstated. I asked when will my global seller rating be reset. 	NO RESPONSE WHAT-SO-EVER. THEY STOLE MY MONEY AND BURIED ME TO THE GROUND!

Manufacturing defect. Need to change spares. Rs 2,650 Expenses. I told it was under warranty. They told ebay invoice date problem. It was not valid. Invoice date 2000 year and invoice no not available. Hence ask from ebay for claim. They gave report to me, regarding this is out of warranty based on invoice. Again I asked to ebay. Again they refused to give replacement. After I ask seller - Cellotronixx They told return cell phone, Need to check and rectify. (If return means will not get replacement). Still my new phone not using condition ( Rs. 7,400 loss to me) Finally ebay cheating me.",1,ebay.com
255,"I'm very disappointed with Ebay policy to defend dishonest sellers. I reporting a situation that could occur for an item worth250 or 2500 dollars. Fortunately I only lost 25 dollars..but some Chinese seller won it. I was unable to select an automatic resolution for this transaction. I was having trouble with this item XX seller by this seller ioomobile. The product has been sent rapidly (in one week or so), but the time interval given by the seller is one month (more than time to avoid any return from paypal, bank or other payment method). Product has been stuck in custom (Portugal, an EU country), I don't understand why, because I've order tents of things, even from China\Malasia\Hong Kong, and never occur before. Is there a possibility that the seller hasn't done the paper billings right to avoid paying taxes? I'm very suspicious about that. However, I don't have any responsibility for the item going to custom, and no information about this situation is reported in the item description. Other strange situation was that after this transaction, the remaining item available has raised its price to 500 euros (I bought this for 22 euros). This is a very strange situation and, if not legal,very suspicious to say the least. I have reported this situation to Ebay's email, customerhelp.at.ebay.com, because the seller has given a time wind of one month (previously pointed out), so no automatically mechanism were available on ebay site to ask for anything that could be asked for (help, refund, cancel transaction, whatever..). Moreover, all the structure, organization and ways to do anything on Ebay's site when I problem arouses to the seller is incredibly not clear and almost impossible to get anything done. The answer from ebay, by email, was that I needed to give the seller time to make things right (not sure what that means..) and that probably I would have my money back or partial refund (some sand to people's eyes, like we say in my country). When this one month window ended I logged in on ebay and asked for a refund in this item\transaction site. What happens next is surreal. The seller in a few minutes canceled the refund, asked to Ebay to step in (what ever that means..), and finally the decision was made to not refund and to close this case. I have appealed to reopen the case, with the argument that the item was going back to the seller, because that's what happens when you do not pay the custom charges. In only a few minutes Ebay has refuted this appeal with the argument that the custom charges should be paid by the buyers. At the end the only person that was impaired in this situation was me (the buyer). I'm not buying this custom charges history, and that's how some company in China makes money without given away its items. And that's my story, not buying on Ebay again, for sure.",1,ebay.com
256,"After years of buying and selling with ebay.com we reached a point where we needed to call in and find out exactly what's going on over there. We spoke to a manager regarding their assumptions on how we run our business and the ability they provide buyers to discredit sellers through feedback.  Our company has over 2400 positive feedback with eBay and pays them on average $1500/month. We have been in business for 19 years and run a tight ship. Ebay's listing search programming is directly related to your feedback...meaning when you receive a negative feedback your listings will be dumped at the bottom of search results. That being said, we took the appropriate measures and still received a negative feedback from a buyer trying to take advantage of the system. When we spoke to the customer support manager at eBay he verbatim said ""the eBay feedback platform does not fall under any defamation of character laws."" How is this even legal? It practically falls somewhere between bribery and extortion. Can someone please address this. We feel like we've invested so much of our time, energy, and money into eBay. Their treatment of a loyal and punctual paying customer is absurd. Thanks in advance. My Best Regards, Alex Llaneza Refrisource.com",1,ebay.com

KoalaOK has my money but ebay is only interested in looking after itself. My advice is stay from ebay you will just lose your money.

They don't care about you like they used to. eBay makes it where sellers are on the losing end. Such corruption but yet they don't see that.

It was a really good original Van Morrison mint LP too that they complained about a mark on the gatefold sleeve. This sold for only £7.99. Another buyer left two malicious negative feedbacks in regard of two antique crucifixes that weren't bid on and sold for 0.99p despite one being fully refunded due to the item not being as sturdy as they thought and the other one, a nice old metal rosary, they decided to keep! I had never been dishonest toward a seller and realised you have to suffer the indignity that these idiotic people inflict and appear as if you are the dishonest one. I realised the cheaper you sold things the more potential damage your feedback can receive. In contrast I had other experiences, close to being informed that my account had been 'permanently restricted' I sold a book for £680.00 and the buyer gave me an extra £20 for all my efforts of finding out how to send it to him in America.",1,ebay.com

I was arguing saying that it is in the eBay and I couldn't print/see because Ebay redirects to the case closed. But they never listened. They were every time saying I didn't provide tracking number and I was saying it was already in eBay and eBay was not letting to me see or print. eBay customer server appeal dept also doesn't have authorize to see that according to them.

NOTHING! i contacted customer service many times and they didnt even take the time to respond to my messages.  Those are just a few of the times ebay has shown how awful their company is.

Their website for seller problems is impossible to navigate and they deliberately make it virtually impossible for sellers to appeal any decisions. Ive had several items destroyed by buyers and then returned facilitated by an Ebay returns process that totally goes in the favour of the buyer regardless of the circumstances - case in point I had 10 years as a seller and 100% feedback and the buyer had a a few months and no feedback and they still found in their favour.

If you can find a way to sell your item any other way I recommend it. Other sites also charge a lot less to sell your item.,1,ebay.com

However, it's really wealthy people getting a percentage of what used to be sold at garage and rummage sales, antique and specialty shows.

318,"This site was created by more greedy megalomaniacs and did not have the best interests of either buyers or sellers at heart. I have spent a lot of money and HUNDREDS of transactions on EBay. I was even a VIP Member with access to a special expedited 800 help line. I no longer use EBay and hope PayPal doesn't suck the way EBAY did and does. The downsides of EBAY are that many traditional sellers are either dumb-dumbs and/or working full time jobs elsewhere. Many are dishonest or just uneducated and do not pay a lot of attention to their storefronts. Youre basically going to a garage sale and rummaging through hoping for a bargain basement deal while getting terrible service. The best sellers on ebay used to be overseas (mostly Chinese) merchants who were legit full-time businesses. Those sellers can now be found on other wesbites. EBAY has lost its original purpose and now has terrible partnerships with big name brands. It doesn't work as a straight retail or discount site because the thrill of cheap finds and winning auctions is now gone AND the non-negotiable ""buy it now"" prices can't compete with other discount retailers like TJ Maxx, Burlington, Amazon or even Target. The deals are much harder to find.  Goodbye Ebay!",1,ebay.com

I mainly purchase on ebay, however their customer service and feedback system have become a total joke and let Fraudulent Sellers take advantage of buyers. I have moved most of my purchasing online to Amazon. I recently had a ebay purchase that never arrived. The seller would not communicate and when I finally got ebay customer service involved they favored the seller because my item had been delivered, however I never received it. It went back to the seller during shipment. So long story short this seller on ebay got my money and the item for keeps and I got nothing. And it gets better, when I tried to warn other ebayer's about this Fraudulent Seller with there Feedback system, it was removed too because a ""Case was Opened"". So this Fraudulent Seller made out great and know one knows about his/her operating practices. Ebay has become a joke and a good place to loose your money!  Use Amazon it's better!",1,ebay.com

325,"I have been an Ebay Seller since 2002. Ebay makes all of their money from the fees they charge sellers, yet they favor buyers who may or may not be truthful about their complaint. They don't have a good system in place to verify that a buyer's complaint is legitimate. They will always side with the Buyer, i.e. if the Buyer says it, it must be true!!?? Ebay won't even allow sellers to leave negative or even neutral feedback on a buyer's account, yet will allow buyers to leave negative feedback on a seller's account, even if it is unwarranted. Ebay makes about $1100/mo in fees off of my seller's account and yet provided me no protection whatsoever when I had the misfortune of a dishonest buyer who purchased one of my new items and returns it used, claimed the item was not as described when it was most definitely accurately described, and then returned the item for a full refund plus $35 in shipping costs both ways. Ebay stepped in and took control of the return process as soon as the buyer made a complaint and issued the buyer a return label, then charged my account for the shipping charges. Ebay didn't even communicate with me about this until after the return had already been processed and my account charged, and did not provide me with any kind of tracking number so that I knew what was going on. In addition, the return address that Ebay provided on the shipping label was incorrect, so the package was not returned to me, but to some other address. When I received an email that the package had been returned and my account charged, I called Ebay to inquire about the location of my package, since I knew that I hadn't received it. I was told that it was delivered to a different address an hour away from my house and that I would be responsible for retrieving my package, AND that Ebay would not cover me for the value of the package, if I wasn't successful in retrieving the package. The Ebay representative told me that I should consider it ""the cost of doing business,"" i.e. write it off as a business loss, since I have a business account. No apology, no concern over the loss of my package, just detest for bothering them with my problem, and rudely telling me to just ""suck it up."" I was told during my initial call to Ebay about this whole ordeal that I would be allowed to go through an appeals process once I received the package back, and that I would be able to inspect the package before issuing the buyer a refund. However, that didn't turn out to be the case at all. Ebay again just took control and went ahead and refunded the buyer for the full amount once tracking confirmation showed the package had been delivered....to the wrong house...without having a chance to inspect the package. For all I know, there's a big rock in the package and the buyer kept the items I sent, valued at over $200. And when I called to initiate the appeals process after the return, they said I would not be able to do an appeals process because the package was delivered to the wrong address. So let me get this straight, Ebay. You only took the buyer's word about the complaint while completely ignoring my input, even though I have 100% positive from many, many transactions and the buyer has a grand total of 3 feedbacks on her account, then took control of my return, charged me for it, didn't provide me with the tracking number, shipped the package to the wrong address, shipped the package uninsured and without signature confirmation, will require me to drive an hour to go knock on some stranger's door and ask if they have my package, won't cover me for the value of the package should I be unsuccessful in retrieving it, lied to me about being able to do an appeal, lied to me about being able to inspect the package before issuing the buyer a refund, all while charging me $1100/mo in fees for their kind services? No thanks Ebay!! I have had my fill of your company and the lack of support your provide to sellers. I don't pay $1100/mo in Ebay fees to be dumped on like this. There are other options for sellers out there and I will be moving over to Amazon, and closing my Ebay account. Goodbye $1100/mo in revenue, which is a drop in the bucket compared to how much they make from sellers collectively, so I'm sure they don't care. BTW, Ebay has increased their fees 200% since I started selling on Ebay in 2002. Amazons fees are much more reasonable. To current sellers on Ebay: proceed at your own risk because if this happens to you, good luck trying to get any recourse from Ebay! They couldn't care less about you as a seller....and don't forget, ""it's just the cost of doing business"" when they screw up and charge you for it.",1,ebay.com

First, we all have Iphones and Mac products as evidenced by any purchase activity. Second, I would never bid on that phone on Ebay, especially if the seller is in the UK. I called Ebay and spend several minutes speaking to a rep. in/from the Philippines. She assured me that it would be taken care of. Two days later, I see a demand for payment from Ebay. I call them immediately and get another rep from the Philippines. I end up relaying the same information as if I never made the initial call to Ebay. I also uncovered that my account was hacked and the hacker changed my address to one in Brooklyn--never received the warning e-mails about account changes from Ebay.

359,"eBay has to be the worst company for a seller. Listen if you are a buyer it is wonderful because you are guaranteed your money back no matter what. This wonderful money back guarantee is also taken advantage by scammer buyers or buyers that are unreasonable. As a seller please be advised that you SHOULD NOT SELL any HIGH priced item on ebay. I would recommend that nothing you put up for sale should be over $500. Most recently I was scammed by a buyer. She purchased my item should. Had the item for almost three weeks then files a claim that my item doesnt seen authentic. Why? because it smells funny the serial number on the authenticity card does not match the serial number in the bag an d that the dust bag is totally fake. I told her that my bag had no smells and that she must have been mistaken because the brand of bag that I sold her does not come with an authenticity card and as such she never received any card for any comparison. I also said that it was strange that she only had these complaints after having the bag for three weeks. I called in and found out that she bought bag through ebay uk even though I shipped bag to a Canadian address and as such ebay UK will be handling the case. HUH????  Ebay asked buyer to provide documentation to substantiate her claimed that the bag didnt seem authentic. Buyer never did that and time ticked away as they waited. They added extra days for her to come up with the document. Meanwhile my Paypal account went into negative because of this dispute. No additional communication from ebay and buyer. I called on the deadline date and was ultimately told that, according to ebay UK, even though the buyer did not provide any documents a buyer has a right to return bag under any circumstances. I was told that this is the cost of doing e commerce. I was even asked to pay return shipping. So imagine this BUYER used the HIGH priced bag for THREE weeks before filing bogus complaint. Buyer had bag for an additional THREE weeks during the sham dispute process. Buyer did not provide any documentation. Buyer now has opportunity to return bag after having it for total SIX weeks. BUT WAIT its gets better!!! Ebay has no way of knowing in what condition buyer will send back item or worse yet if buyer returns the same item that was sent. As a seller, you are out of luck either way. Buyers have figured out the loop holes and are buying things to either test and return for refund or they are buying with the intention of doing the old switcheroo. Once you (as the seller) receive the item and its not what you sold or it is damaged, used and abused, you are out of luck as Ebay will tell you they have no way of knowing what was sent or what was received. They will tell you to file a police report. There are so many sellers that have been scammed by this new wave of over confident buyer/scammers. Please heed my advice. Do not list anything on Ebay that you cant afford to give away. Sellers have no protection!!!!",1,ebay.com
360,"If you're trying to sell a few of your own items on ebay then please save your time, money and energy to find a different site or just gift/donate them to people. It is just not worth it. The fees alone will devalue what you think you're getting for your items. In addition they will never charge the appropriate amount for shipping, they will take fees off of your shipping cost and then for some reason randomly not charge the initial shipping price until you receive a monthly invoice that is an absurd amount. On selling $100 worth of items in 3 auctions I owed $32 on the invoice. $20 was for a shipping label that they only charged $18 for, took a $3 fee from and I still spent $16 out of pocket for the materials to ship.  Honestly just save yourself some frustration and get the item to someone local through craigslist or word of mouth.",1,ebay.com

363,"Interestingly, whenever I made a purchase from eBay and didn't get it, I got no help in obtaining a refund and was stiffed. But now that I've sold things on eBay WOW have I gotten ripped off by buyers and eBay seems to be okay with that. Two times I've buyers claimed items arrived empty when I'm sure they didn't, but I ended up having to refund. The most recent offense was that I advertised an expensive brand (made in France) cast iron casserole which was in very good condition. It was just an older one that ended up not being used regularly (literally used once) because it was so heavy. Newer casseroles in that size from that brand now range in price at $300+ at retail, but they have a different knob and color interior enamel. Buyer claimed I sold him a new (shows what good condition it was in) ""fraudulent product Made in China, not France."" I provided evidence of authenticity, but then buyer changed story because he knew he couldn't use that excuse and claimed I said the exact same product sells for $300 at retail so he could file for a refund saying I misrepresented it in the product. I said ""same brand/size casserole"" ran that price (actually they run more), knowing I could not say it was exactly the same because they don't sell that one anymore. He then messaged me, after his first really nasty/threatening message and tried to play to my sympathy saying he had kids in college, etc. and I should just refund the money (after 1st message threatening me). I replied that I was out of work, had a broken wrist, and was trying to sell items to scale down for a move to a smaller apartment, so we all have problems. Sure he was trying to manipulate me, I looked up his name on LinkedIn, and the dude has an high level IT job, so he's not exactly hurting. He's just a jerk. For all I know his kids might live with an ex and he might be behind on child support - or he might not have any. I called eBay and messaged through their system that the guy was manipulating their system and I shouldn't be on the hook for that. I noted that he could have asked me about the product beforehand if he had concerns and I would have directed him to the website where I purchased it for evidence (just as I did when he made his claim afterward), but he didn't and that ample photos were provided in the listing. He was just upset that his product was sold on QVC vs. Williams Sonoma, apparently. I guess it wasn't posh enough a pedigree for him. Regardless, it was the same brand and was Made in France. The person I spoke with at eBay agreed that I did not misrepresent the item when she read my messages and reviewed the listing. She said to file a counter claim, which I did. I was confident they'd see this was a manipulation by the buyer. The next day, eBay sided with the buyer anyhow and now I also have to pay return shipping too for this very heavy item that's going across the entire country back to me. So I'm out nearly $160 (with shipping, packing, and fees) now over a $75.00 sale! I am closing my account with eBay after this and will NEVER use their service again. If they will not honestly review these claims with an unbiased view, then I cannot risk losing money every time I list with them, least of all when I'm unemployed. I should be charging them for taking so much time away from my job hunt to resolve this ridiculous case. I had 100% ratings - both as a buyer and a seller prior to this incident, btw, with buyers noting my items were ""as described"" and ""well packaged"" and my communication with them was good.",1,ebay.com

365,"I purchased a car through ebay motors from Seller joegeeting which does business as: Liberty Auto Exchange 069 Pines Rd. Etters, PA 17319 After Purchasing the vehicle had many mechanical problems. Spent over 3000 dollars in repairs. I left a negative feedback on ebay. The owner of Liberty Auto Exchange contested the negative feedback. This then involved net neutrals to review the case and determine if the feedback I left should be removed.  In responding to net neutrals, I uploaded my receipts for parts ordered for the repairs and also indicated that the car was in much worse shape than what the listing led one to believe. The car was snowed in for a week or so and when the transport company went to to pickup the car, no inspection could be done since the car was filthy and no one was around from this used car dealer - they just left the keys for them. The transport company noted that they could not inspect the vehicle upon pickup since no one from the dealer was around. Upon receiving the vehicle the key fob had no battery and when batteries were inserted, the car would not lock or unlock correctly. In order to operate the car the batteries from the key fob had to be removed. It was very apparent why the dealer removed the batteries. The dealer said the car was probably damaged in transit. Throwing out such a statement was ridiculous. If the dealer knew an inspection would be done when the car was picked up with them there, they purposely were not present because an inspection would have been done and the problems would have been discovered. Net neutrals made the assumption the car was damaged in transit in spite of no indication as such. I uploaded my receipts for repairs to prove what shape the car was in. Net neutrals stated I should have included mechanic reports of the problems. If they want this, I could have went to the mechanics to get this information.  It has become apparent that net neutrals in not neutral in any sense of the word.  I normally don't purchase cars through ebay. This was my first and last time. Ebay removed my feedback based on a technicality. First time purchasers of a car through ebay would not be astute enough to cover all the details to protect themselves from purchasing a car from a user car dealer in another state. Do yourself a favor, do not purchase an auto through ebay Pictures can be VERY deceiving. Buy locally where you can go and see the car and protect yourself. I will NEVER purchase anything of any significant value from Ebay and I encourage you to do the same. One final note, I received a message through my Ebay message box telling me of their decision. When I attempt to respond to this email, in my Ebay message box I get an unknown error. If I test a response to other messages in my Ebay message box, I can respond, however for this notification message which does not state that I should not respond, I get an error when I do respond. Apparently Ebay does not want to communicate any further on this purchase. I will be closing my account in a few days. I am done with Ebay. Another interesting fact, over half of the reviews here on sitejabber for ebay are negative.......enough said!",1,ebay.com

370,"My experience with ebay has been absolutely horrible. They will respond to your inquiries but will never do any follow-up work to resolve the issue.  In a nutshell, this is what happened..... I purchased 4 outfits from a seller, the items were shipped and I received them in a timely manner. None of items were as described or listed. I contacted the seller and we had a Whatsapp conversation in which I informed him the items that were sent were not as expected, he went on to try and convince me that what I received is a better product and that I don't know anything. The seller admitted to not providing me with what I thought I had purchased. The seller was condescending and didn't want to listen to anything I had to say. I was finally successful in getting a return address from him to send the items back.  The next day, I went to FedEx and spent $450 to ship these items back. On the FedEx website, it showed my delivery was in transit for 5 months. I contacted FedEx and finally they were able to tell me the seller didn't complete the paperwork and the package was abandoned. Once I got this information, I have been in constant communication with ebay and they are unwilling to step up to even investigate. I have asked for someone to call me to discuss and this is a difficult task for ebay to complete.  Finally, my last recourse is I went back to my credit card company and asked them to charge back the seller. Fingers crossed, that they will be able to finally settle and close this dispute.  After this experience, I will never deal with ebay again and will ensure people are aware of their business practices. I shop on Amazon all the time and have never run into any problems. Amazon truly cares about its buyers and makes sure they are completely satisfied. They are not looking for the one time purchase customer, amazon appreciates customer loyalty and they will take care of them accordingly.  Stay away from ebay, nothing good will come of it!!!

They need proper training and they need to go back to school. They are all a set of DUNCE RUDE people who don't know how to handle customer complaints. What they need to know is without the customer there is no business or Job! I will not be buying from you guys ever again!

378,"I have sold on ebay for some time. When I first started selling it was fun, I had good buyers for the most part and I could make a little extra cash. Not anymore. In the past year I have lost to much money to continue. Their return policy sucks. I had a buyer that got a phone charger. Buyer emailed me the day after they got the item and said it didn't work and opened a return. Ebay makes you accept the return so I had no choice but to agree. I sent the buyer an email along with the ebay policy for returns and one of those stipulations is that the item must be returned in original packaging, Item was sold with free shipping packaged in a box along with packing materials. Buyer did return item in an envelope. Item was working fine has charged my phone 3 times now. Item was received on time in working condition, Ebay states ""Not covered Buyer remorse or any reason other than not receiving an item or receiving an item that isnt as described in the listing (see the sellers return policy for return options). Items damaged during pick-up or shipping or not delivered when the buyer arranges pick-up or shipping of the item (for instance, the buyer arranges freight). I have a no return policy which I know doesn't mean anything to ebay, but as stated buyer received the item in working condition but claimed it did not work. Once I received the item back I called ebay asking them about their return policy, I told them that the item was in working condition and did not meet their requirements for a refund. Of course the only way to know that the item was working was to have buyer return the item to me. Ebay told me that even though the buyer returned the item me, lied about the reason they were returning the item I would have to refund the entire amount plus the return shipping. I asked ebay if I could deduct the return shipping and was told that the buyer would have to approve that and if they didn't I would have to refund the entire sale plus lose money I had to pay to have the buyer return a working item. They said I could appeal but they could not guarantee an outcome in my favor. So in other words you are screwed. So now I am stuck with a working item that I would have to sale as used, am out the amount of the item, shipping to the buyer and shipping back to me for the refund.  The return policy should state that a buyer for any reason can return any item at any time no matter the condition and the seller will be made to accept the return and refund any and all money to the buyer. Why would anyone want to sell on ebay anymore. Best thing to do is buy on ebay, use the item until you don't want it anymore and return it to get your money back. I don't have any use for ebay anymore and will not be selling on their site again. I am tired of losing money!!!",1,ebay.com
379,"Do NOT buy into the hype of selling internationally on eBay. You know where they tell you they make it easy for you to sell worldwide. It's easy because it's a ripoff. I have sold several items on eBay throughout the years and decided to try selling internationally for a certain item I had that I thought might do well worldwide. I was right and the item was purchased by someone in New Zealand. eBay claims that they make selling internationally easy, all the seller has to do is send it to a shipping house in KY and they will do the rest for you. I did that, I sent my item to KY, where it was received on March 30th. The customs paperwork etc. was done and it was then sent to New Zealand, where it is now being held in customs. The problem, eBay is also holding my money, until it's actually delivered to the buyer. Now some may think that sounds reasonable, however, my job, my ""duty"" was to get it to KY, not to New Zealand. eBay accepted the responsibility to get it to New Zealand, so once it got to KY, it should no longer have been on me. If they filled out the customs paperwork wrong, or they replaced my item with a brick, that's on them, not on me. However, if the item sits in customs because paperwork was filled out wrong, I don't get paid until it's corrected and delivered. However, eBay has already invoiced me for their share of the sale and there is a possibility that it will come out of my account before I even get paid. (They automatically bill through your PayPal account). I called eBay and went through the above with the representative, who tried to override the system and could not. I then asked her for a supervisor. The supervisor could not, or would not, override the system either. I then asked it to be escalated above that supervisor and again that person said the same thing. The first girl told me that I was not the only person to complain about this. I am seriously thinking about looking into a class action suit. I fulfilled my end of the deal by getting it to KY and I left it in eBay's hands. What happened after it left KY, should be on them, not me and I should be getting paid for doing what I was supposed to do. Word to the wise, DO NOT SELL INTERNATIONALLY on eBay!!! It's basically a ripoff unless you are willing to put your item and money in someone else's hands and wait forever to get paid.",1,ebay.com

Every year in the Spring they announce their ""improvements"" which inevitably includes higher fees, lower discounts and smaller hoops with bigger flames to jump through in order to keep the great rewards I've already earned. They're so busy trying to compete with Amazon they have NO IDEA who their sellers are anymore. They forget that it was THE SMALL BUSINESSES who BUILT EBAY and individual people who sell UNIQUE AND INTERESTING ITEMS THAT YOU CANNOT FIND ON PLACES LIKE AMAZON. And still even though I've spent so much precious time and energy sourcing beautiful items and present impeccable listings I don't get enough traffic because i'm still somehow forced to compete with Chinese sweatshop junk and to jump through these ridiculous hoops that no small seller of unique items should have to jump through in order to get any traffic at all. HAVING TO ACCEPT RETURNS OF ANTIQUE AND VINTAGE JEWELRY AND CLOTHES WITHIN THIRTY DAYS? ARE YOU KIDDING? I should be able to charge a rental fee. And now this year they've announced they're not only INCREASING the seller standards for top rated sellers but DECREASING the discount! Why should I bother? Here's what I think: They should separate eBay into two factions -eBay USED / and eBay NEW (eBazon) eBay USED would operate like the traditional glorious eBay of long ago: Powerseller/ No powerseller. Lower the fees, give everyone an level playing ground and let the quality of the listings and the product speak for itself. Sellers who throw their junk on the floor and take crappy photos will get the consequent lack of sales and they'll either learn to raise the bar for themselves or stick to selling off their lawn. The eBay NEW can do what it does to compete with Amazon and let the big box sellers duke it out over the margins of their cheap overseas chotchkies.

In your purchase history if the item is over a few months old and you click it to buy from the people you bought from before it doesn't bring you to them, instead it shows you similar products. You don't build brand loyalty With this. They want the credit or brand to be eBay. This hurt sales as well. 3. They increased the cost of an anchor store and raised the number of free ads on this to 10,000 ads.

For last two years, when Ebay started having more sellers from China to sell staff. the quality of the products has gone away down. Ebay is no longer a trusting and safe site to buy anything now. Don't buy anything from eBay , especially the products are listed under "" china"" if you can avoid.

After 50 minutes of discussion with 3 different people (none of which speaks clear English) I finally hung up. The seller already credited me back the full amount. Ebay sent me a return label to ship the item across the country to North Carolina to a bogus address that doesn't exist. The item came back a week later looking like it had traveled around the world via chimpanzees. The seller told me for the trouble to keep the item, or whatever I wanted to do with it, and gave me the full credit. Ebay, on the other hand, is impossible: the first 2 representatives understood and agreed that I should get a credit, but the 3rd (very poor English) only wanted to argue.

I must be present to sign with a valid government issued ID showing that I am 21 years or older in order to receive the package. I asked if they could drop the package off at a UPS store that is close to my house so I could pick it up. They said that the sender placed restrictions that only allows 3 attempts of delivery or I could pick up the package at the UPS store that is located 28 miles away from my house & I must present a government issued ID to pick it up! UPS only attempted deliveries during my work hours & they would not give me an estimated time window for delivery. These restrictions were COMPLETELY UNREASONABLE. The package contains shoes! This is not a top secret government file! The seller would not lift the restrictions so I filed a Buyers Protection claim for a refund because I could not receive the package because of all the restrictions that the seller put in place & eBay sided with the seller! The seller did not require an ID to receive my money, they took my money with ease...but they made it VERY DIFFICULT for me to receive my package. eBay's BUYER Protection is a joke!

I only thought you couldn't sell a fake if you were being deceptive which I was not. I listed two. One was brown and one black. They pull off the listing for the brown one and suspended my selling privileges for one week. I called after waiting on hold for quite awhile I talked to two people who couldn't help me. I went back on hold and then someone from that department answered and I explained everything. I even told him there was another black purse listed. He said nothing about removing it. A couple days later I got another notification that my selling privileges were suspended indefinitely and they removed the black purse. I called again. Waited and waited and finally spoke to another customer service rep and was told they couldn't help me. I waited again and was transferred to that department. I got an agent who couldn't speak English and explained again all that had happened. He assured me after the 7 days I could resume selling. He said he would note the system and I would be fine. So that Sunday I tried to list more items. I couldn't so I called. I was told I had to wait right to the minute of my 1 week suspension and that was at 12:57 pm that day. So I waited. I tried again and still couldn't. I called again. After waiting on hold I spoke to another representative that informed me once you're suspended indefinitely there was no way out of that. She told me I could sell other items and I said no that's not what I was told. She went on to explain that the previous agent mis-spoke and there was nothing she could do about it. I told her I was not accepting that response and wanted to speak to a manager. After waiting on hold again I got some manager named Austin on the phone. He was rude, uncompassionate, and uncaring as to my situation and what I had been told. I told him to listen to the phone recorded conversations and he would see how much time I had spent trying to clear this up. He said I ""relisted"" the item after the first notification and them pulling it. I said the hell I did. That there were two items all along and I even told the agent that and he said nothing about removing it. Then I told him the other agent said that they would lift the indefinite suspension and only the 7 day one would stand. And he told me I was misinformed!!! He said once you get an indefinite you could never sell in that category again. He said they would use my ""bad experience"" as a ""learning tool"" for the people training. I said oh how nice for them that all my time and energy spent and being misinformed was going to be a learning tool for others but too bad for me! I told him to cancel my store contract because I don't sell anything else and not to send me an invoice for early termination. I told him ebay has gotten to big and apparently forgot that the little consumer is how they got started and I hope I'm around to see when they fold. Because it's going to happen just like the big box stores that got to big for their own good and are now closing shop. I told him I don't know how he can work for a company who cares nothing about the consumers and I didn't know how he could sleep at night!

I listed an item in an incorrect category when trying to get the selling listing together, eBay sent me a message and immediately restricted my account indefinitely without warning. I called customer support and the agent on the phone was SO RUDE to me and was telling me all these other ways he would restrict my account for trying to lift the permanent ban on my account for listing items. The fees are also 13-15% of your sales so it's not worth your time to even list on there. There are so many other selling platforms that have much better customer service than this. eBay doesn't even have a strike policy, you screw up once and you're completely cut off.

435,"As a buyer, I've received broken items, items with holes and items that were completely different than their descriptions. I've waited 2 months to receive items from China just for them to fall apart within minutes of receiving them. When returning an item, I've been charged a ""restocking fee"" by the seller for an item that was never used and still in original packaging and could be resold at full retail price. Then eBay auto drafted money out of my PayPal account without my knowledge or approval for the shipping label to return the item, costing me almost as much to just have kept the item. Had I known all this I probably would have just kept the item. As a seller, I've listed and sold an item, then issued a partial refund to the buyer but was still invoiced by eBay for 10% of the initial listing price, without the refund. That's because eBay takes 10% of everything you sell. You can just think of that like for every $80 you sell, you're giving up an $8 item to eBay for free. As if that's not enough, today I received an invoice that was too high to be 10% of the total cost of the items I had sold, so I contacted their ""do not care"" department and spoke with a woman who told me they are now charging their beastly 10% on the ""total value"" meaning you're paying them 10% of what it costs to ship the item as well. Now that $8 item you're giving away to the money lords of eBay for $80 worth of sales is a $10 loss because you pay 10% of shipping cost, plus 10% of the item's cost. I tried to reason with this woman explaining that in all my listings, I select the option to charge the actual cost of shipping to the buyer. I do not make any profit on shipping, why should I have to pay eBay 10% of it? Did they somehow assist with picking up my boxes? She told me they were doing this now to entice more sellers to offer free shipping. I told her they were enticing more sellers to sell elsewhere if they want to have anything left over as profit.

The seller goes by the handle pauburn_21 and he is with eforexstore.com, which has yet to respond to my email. When you are dealing with ebay, you are dealing with their robot, and it appears to be impossible to contact a human. Their robot is going by the 2 day shipping for download, not the 17 day shipping for snail mail. Thus ebay considers my 30 day window closed when it should actually close Feb. 3rd or thereabouts.

452,I bought a used Apple MacBook from a seller on Ebay and paid nearly $500. The seller described the item as working fine and no problems except a few cosmetic blemishes. The seller name was TekReplay. Once this item was received and given as a Christmas gift it was turned on and used for the first time. Immediately it was noticed that the laptop is saying to service battery. Apparently the battery has never had a replacement since it was new in 2011. I contacted seller who said return it if you aren't happy with it that we don't send out replacement parts or partial refunds. The laptop had a 1 year warranty on it. They should have to replace anything that goes wrong with it. Called EBay and got the runaround. We need to give the seller time to make it right until January 3rd then you can call us back (doesn't speak a bit of English) and we will try to make it right.

Most of the problems I experience are with Chinese sellers on e-bay. I return, have the item replaced or got refunds about 15% of the time. The most recent issue I had with a a Chinese seller shows how the Chinese seller use Americans buyers kindness to scam American buyers happened few days ago with me.  I fly often, most of the airlines offer entertainment through phones, laptops or tablets. I decided to buy and use a 14 inch tablet. With the tablet I bought a purchased light weight keyboard. I prefer to use keyboard instead of the on screen keyboard.  I searched the internet, learned enough about these kind of keyboards, then went to my favorite website eBay. There I found many Chinese sellers offering the same keyboard for prices that varied by 20% up and down. Most of them offered free shipping. The seller I selected listed The keyboard as Mini Bluetooth 3.0 Wireless Keyboard Touch-pad 81Keys for PC Android Windows. The cost was $15.22 plus $.99 shipping. I read through most of the seller website and select this seller because offered six month warranty. The eBay seller is newmango. Their website for the item is http://www.eBay.com/itm/141971087917?ul_noapp=true On the seller website, clearly state's that the warrant in Bold Red as follow: Warranty and Guarantee  6 month Manufacturers Warranty for defective items (excluding items damaged and/or misused after receipt). Accessories come with a 3-monthwarranty I purchased t the keyboard on September 16, 2016, got it a week later. I used it twice while traveling, it worked fine. Third time, on a long flight from London, it stopped working. Once in my office, I replaced the cable that connects the keyboard to the PC for charging and communication, the keyboard was still bad. I wrote the seller through eBay messaging the following: -  Hello, I purchased the keyboard late September. I used it three times on the plane. Last week traveling from London to ls Angeles the keyboard stopped working. Once in my office, l replaced the cable but it did not fix it. I connected it my tablet to my office keyboard. I was able to use my tablet. The keyboard is dead. Please advice of I have it fixed or replaced. Two days later I got this response form the Chinese seller newmango: -  Dear buyer Thanks for your contact. Sorry for any inconvenience caused. for this case, can we issue refund 2USD for you as compensation to fix the issue? looking forwards for your reply I believe you are a good buyer, will contact me back, then solve the issue smoothly.  best regards So the seller with broken English politely tried to shaft me. Instead of offering refund or honor their warranty, they offered me $2 to go away. Very smart and very sleek! I responded to them as follow: -  If you guys want to do business with Americans; you have to honor the warranty. This keyboard has 6 month warranty, so either replace it or refund my money. otherwise i will give you bad review on the internet They responded with: -  ok, we will resend you a new one today These Chinese sellers believe that Americans are fools. Just like their government taking advantage of our stupid politicians to receive favorite trade agreements and sell us their products but we cannot sell them our products.

I have received two defective items and one that does not fit, and I am having a heck of a time getting my money refunded on all of these. One is a steam vacuum cleaner that broke the third time I used it. The seller said they wouldn't refund my money; that since I'd had it for four months I had to go through the warranty process. In doing this I found out that this vacuum is from 2010, is no longer manufactured, and almost no service center services it anymore. I found one that does service this model and took the vacuum to them; they are to get back to me on repair price, but the vacuum is still under warranty so the warranty may take care of it. My preference was just to get my money refunded and I am going through this process under duress by the seller. The other item is a purse from China that arrived with a broken zipper. The seller made me take a photo of the zipper and then dunned me to change my negative to a positive review. Another Chinese seller whose product never arrived also has dunned me to change a negative to a positive review. Finally, I ordered a leather vest described as being a size 8 ""small to medium."" When it arrived it turned out to be more like a size 4. But the seller refuses to take the vest back and eBay is siding with the seller because the designation ""8"" appears on the label. But the vest is NOT as described. It is made for a child or a small teenager and I'm a grown woman who have to hold my arms up and then lower the vest onto them to put it on.

I did not mention the charge of $40.90 charges by Pitney Bowes Inc. / Ebay to cover the transport costs of the seller in the USA The cost of the transport from the USA to Thailand were clear $10, 95. In case Ebay will not admit this kind of abuse your place is clearly between the abusing parties! Import duties over-charged with 127% Shipping cost over-charged with more than 400% I consider the extraction of $25.- as theft as it has nothing to do with the by Ebay mentioned obligation to pay import duties to the Government This article of Change.org is circulating on the Internet and explains clearly the problem! Ebay's Global Shipping Programs' only use is to illegally gouge and steal money from non-US customers. Any time an American Ebay retailer sells an item to someone outside the USA, some company called Pitney Bowes blindly adds a %15 charge to the item's final value, on top of the sellers shipping and handling fees, for no apparent reason. The buyer has no option to opt out of this bogus service. These unfair and unjust fees are forced on the buyer illegally. It's nothing but a scam and Canadians are tired of being taken advantage of!! It has nothing to do with shipping or handling. We know this because the seller takes the item to a USPS Post Office, the same as they always did. There is no way USPS would know to forward this particular piece of mail to some third party handler, as opposed to any other piece of mail. They simply deliver this item as they do any other item, for the normal rate. As well, this has nothing to do with taxes or duties. Pitney Bowes just blindly adds a fee to any item's final price, regardless of the item's tax eligibility. In many cases, there is NO TAX to be charged on a particular parcel, however this does not seem to make any difference. Ebay and Paypal. Shame on you for allowing PITNEY BOWES to money-grab your customers. This should be illegal, but unfortunately we will have to sue Ebay, Paypal and Pitney Bowes for fraud in a class-action lawsuit. It is horrendous that a company allows a third party to steal from their customers like this.",1,ebay.com
488,"hi, I had ordered a stroller but my husband didnt know about it and refused delivery at the door, the seller received the stroller back and kept the money, I tried to get ebay to help they said there is no protection of a refusal order, and would not help me, when I tried to leave negative feedback since the seller unlawfully kept the stroller and didnt even offer to have me just pay shipping twice, ebay removed my feedback! So I think they remove negative feedback to increase their positive standings, and this should not be happening.",1,ebay.com
489,"Ebay just doesn't seem to get how to compete in today's market. Whether it's buying or selling you're bound to get screwed by these jackoffs.  It started when they eliminated the option for sellers to leave negative feedback about buyers- now sellers are leaving positive feedback about negative experiences with buyers because that is the only way they can warn other sellers. Now if you have an issue with a buyer you can ""report"" them, which never even yields a response from ebay. Also, as a seller they force you to offer a return policy, which is understandable but it doesn't really matter what your return policy is or how long the buyer takes to want to return something, ebay always sides with the buyer. With used items, forcing a 30 day return policy is ridiculous. If something was damaged when you received it would you wait 30 days to complain? NO. It's leaving the door open for people who know how to scam the system. Furthermore some things are time sensitive- aka if I have a 30 day return policy on a prom dress, the buyer can wear it then return it. Poshmark has a 3 day policy, this is great; they receive it and inspect it and that's that. Now if you're buying on ebay and aren't familiar with it, you'll be had by the overflowing amount of knockoffs and fakes. Sure, most people know the stuff from China is fake and never the proper size, color, quality as the image implies, but now these foreign sellers have gotten smarter and are listing these items as ""ships from US"" when they really don't. If you check the feedback, they may have 98-99% feedback but when you read the reviews the amount of negative comments is astonishing. Regardless of how many items a seller sells, how many reports that an item is fake or that buyers are unhappy with a seller need to be made before ebay eliminates that seller? Who knows? But I've seen sellers with literally thousands of negative feedback. It is a true testament of ebay's character that they knowingly allow these shady, illegal knockoff sellers to continue on ebay, and we the good sellers pay the price.  I've been a member since 1999. My feedback is 100%. Does ebay care? Not in the slightest, they'll side with a buyer who has a string of shady feedback. Now let's talk about payment... What other site let's you buy something but not have to pay for it right away? You can add it to your cart on other sites, but until it's paid for, somebody else can actually pay for it and swipe it out from under you. Not on ebay. Once somebody commits to buy that item just sits there waiting for payment. And if the payment isn't made after so many days, instead of being able to relist it, you have to open a case and wait another week to see if the person is going to pay. You used to be able to sort of protect yourself from this as a seller by blocking new buyers but now ebay says that's discriminatory towards new buyers who need to build up feedback. You can block an individual member, but they have to screw you over before you know to add them to your list!  Also, ebay tries to force it's members to ship items same or next day. While I appreciate this service, you're saying if my buyer dinks around and waits 7 days to pay for an item that I have to rush to the PO to get it out to them- DUMB! Clearly they didn't want it that fast or they would have paid right away. In no way is this a comprehensive list of issues you're sure to incur with ebay, but it's a good warning to stay away if you're an honest person whether you plan to sell or buy!",1,ebay.com

However, upon receiving the item (a white purse), we immediately noticed several smudges on the front flap that had not been disclosed and that do not meet reasonable expectations for a ""new "" item. We thought this might be dirt, so we gently wiped it with a soft cloth, without effect. We then posted photos of the defect and asked the seller for a refund. This was refused, so we appealed to eBay.  eBay ruled against us on the basis that attempting to wipe what appeared to be dirt from the item constituted ""modification"" of the item, thus voiding the warranty. Several long discussions with eBay failed to result in a refund. However, several eBay representatives agreed with us that the spots we photographed are faintly visible on the seller's own photographs of the item, if one knows where to look.",1,ebay.com

When I've recounted the details to other people, that's the first thing they is instantly dodgy.

' The amount actually deducted by 'oldgatetrick' was actually AUD $254.73... approximately 12% higher than the quoted price and inclusive of the postage fee.  I emailed them twice: via the 'Contact us' link on their webpage and privately via my own email address.  Their website states: 'All complaints will be acknowledged within 7 working days, although we try to acknowledge all complaints immediately where possible.

Seller has 1500 positive reviews, 1 neutral, 0 negative. The reason it's so perfect is because the seller will refuse to help/bribe you over reviews, and Ebay sided with seller on removing my review without even asking. Essentially, their rating system is 100% rigged. Item also took 5 weeks to ship using the global shipping program and costed me $100, however my return shipping was 5 days for non-express, meaning they could have shipped it direct in far less time for less price ($80).

Everything went smoothly & I proved to them I am legit. My customer satisfaction ratings were just about perfect. Only one neutral rating and ZERO negative ratings.

I know very well what people their workplace consists of. In fact they're so asian oriented, I bet they eat dogs for breakfast & cats for dinner. I highly recommend avoiding this company like the plague. If you have any form of success at an early stage, they will remove your selling benefits.

After opening the case the seller agreed for a refund after the item is returned.

So the seller asks me to ship the item back and he will refund it. The item is returned and seller is unresponsive. I contact eBay and they say in a very monotonous voice that they will step in and only refund me the original price and original shipping only but not return shipping as that is out of eBay.

I was willing to bear the shipping cost but these guys did not budge. Their customer support SUCKS!!! First of all you have to raise a claim with photos and proofs which has to be verified by them, and can no way be compared to other online sellers like amazon. Secondly it takes more than 25 minutes to connect to their call center. When you speak to the rep, you get a very good response and are assured that your complaint would be resolved positively. But later a call comes from their Delhi branch claims department comes as a rude shock asking you to PROOVE that it is not as per expectation. You may well appoint a supreme court lawyer to fight your case at this point. The claims department is biased towards the seller and for me they never accepted the claim. I wonder what 100% satisfaction means to to them. I believe Ebay has different customer policies based on the geography.

No real way around it. eBay has designed this feature to cater to the buyer such that the buyer, after wasting your time, simply requests a cancel transaction, you are given two choices. Accept Cancellation or I Can't Cancel This Transaction. If you chose I can't cancel this transaction it asks you why? Did you Ship it? What Date did you ship it? And then SUBMIT. So the only real option you have is ACCEPT > SUBMIT.  Then after all is done. This "" Feedback Awaiting 1 Item"" Pops up. You think I will leave neutral feedback as that is the right thing to do. When you press the ""1 Item"", Much to your surprise the button won't do anything. Then you decide to call, you are forwarded to the Asian Help Line who says ""You can't leave Feedback"" ! Wow! I guess I don't understand. You go to a business luncheon and shake on a deal and then decide to crawfish on it, and then the guy you shook on the deal is left with a waste of time.

I was excited to find formula I had been ordering at $200-$300/month, but they have permanently lost me as a customer based on this experience.

The ad said that it was a complete car with rust free body & frame, and engine & tranny that ran just one year earlier, but will need rebuilt. I called the seller and he said again it was rust free, had the correct engine and would run with just a little work, but the whole interior was trashed & it had no brakes no brakes. I paid $3000.00 for it plus $700.00 for transport. Before I bid, the last thing I saw was the ""buy with confidence ebay guarantee""   When the car arrived, the trunk floor & lid were rotted out, the back floor was rusted and arrived full of water & mud. some of the body had rust holes and there clearly had been previous body work done. I then found out many parts were missing and the engine was the wrong engine completely, and never ran because it was not even fully assembled.  I contacted the seller, and he claimed his ""friend"" must have taken some parts from the car and also must have mickey moused some items. Then he admitted that the pictures he used were years old and that the car was sitting in a field hidden in the weeds those years. He then went on to say the money was gone, spent on medical bills. A liar for sure.  I filed a claim with e-bay. I get a call from a woman who is talking fast who say's, ""we are denying your claim & since we don't have a listed reason for the denial, we are going to fill in the reason for denial as non-payment"" So, later when I call, I get a curt answer saying I have to actually pay for the item before I can file a claim!!!!! This despite of the fact ebay has e-mail sent through them proof from the seller that I paid.

Here are the reasons: Ebay's customer service and resolution center employees are lack of competent, knowledge, analytical skills, professional care, due diligence, and have no clues how to handle/solve problems. Here is a scenario of an existing problem: when a buyer makes an accusation about a product; logically, that individual needs to have a proof or some types of evidence to support the accusation. Based on the scenario above, Ebay's model of solving problems between buyers and sellers are as follows: By not requiring evidence from buyer, ignoring the facts, information, and other relevant details that relates to the accusation, Ebay creates unfair treatment and bias against the seller. 'Doing business with Ebay is unpleasant and costly for seller's business.

I paid $167.00 for 5 day shipping. And I didn't get the items until 3 weeks later. I am a good eBay buyer and a responsible customer. The communication from the seller was poor.

586,"BIG JOKE! TODAY ON THE NEWS IT WAS STATED THAT EBAY IS ACCUSING AMAZON OF 'POACHING' THEIR CUSTOMERS.... WHAT A JOKE. PEOPLE PREFER AMAZON FOR THE SIMPLE FACT THAT EBAY SUCKS! PEOPLE SWITCH TO A PLACE WHERE THEY ARE RESPECTED AND APPRECIATED AND THAT FOR SURE IS NOT THE CASE WITH EBAY. I SOLD ON EBAY SINCE 2001. IN THOSE DAYS THEY SENT CERTIFICATES OF APPRECIATION FOR MY OUTSTANDING SERVICE AS A POWER SELLER. THINGS WERE SO DIFFERENT IN THOSE DAYS. I WAS KICKED OFF EBAY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND WAS NEVER GIVEN A REASON FOR THAT. DID NOTHING DIFFERENT, STILL GAVE OUTSTANDING SERVICE AND WAS A TOP RATED POWERSELLER WITH OVER 11,500 POSITIVE FEEDBACKS. STILL TO THIS DAY WAS NEVER GIVEN AN EXPLANATION WHY THEY JUST DELETED OVER 1000 LISTINGS AND PREVENTED ME FROM EVER SELLING ON THE SITE AGAIN. AT THE TIME WHEN WE ASKED THEM WHAT THE REASON WAS, THEY SAID SOMEONE HAD A CHARGE BACK. REALLY??? CHARGE BACK? THEY GOT THEIR ITEM AND WE WERE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM BUYING FROM US - EBAY ACCEPTED THE SALE AND WE DID OUR BIT.... SO WHY AMAZON IS MORE POPULAR AND PEOPLE PREFER TO SHOP THERE IS THAT CUSTOMERS ARE RESPECTED. I SOLD ON AMAZON YEARS AGO AND THEY WERE A PLEASURE TO WORK WITH. NOW EBAY DISRESPECTS SELLERS AND TREATS THEM LIKE DIRT. GLAD TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE LOSING CUSTOMERS - WAY TO GO! EBAY IS RUN BY INCOMPETENT IDIOTS - GONE ARE THE DAYS WHEN SELLERS WERE APPRECIATED - THEY FORGET THAT SELLERS ARE ALSO BUYERS!!!",1,ebay.com
587,"I have been a member of ebay since 2001 and as a buyer i found their services are good but as a seller however it is more of a headache then its worth. For one when selling something they take a certain percentage off for shipping charges, i don't make money off of my shipping so if i charge the exact shipping charges then i am out money after their fees are taken off and if i charge more shipping to counteract these charges then the buyer gets angry and leaves bad ratings. Also the fact that as a seller i cannot leave a buyer negative or neutral feedback which has left me open to being blackmailed by buyers saying if i don't give them their money back (because they aren't satisfied even though it is exactly as described) and let them keep the item they will leave me negative feedback and they can do this knowing that there is nothing i can do about their rude behavior, so they have me backed against a wall. Example i sell beads online the person who recieved my beads was no satisfied with the amount they received and even though it was stated on the auction how many they get, they told me if i didn't send them more beads that i was going to recieve negative feedback, so what am i suppose to do? I either have to send more or get bad feedback. Also if someone decides not to pay at all still i cannot leave the negative feedback. So they get away with costing me business and there is nothing i can do but report them but no one see's that. I think if these buyers knew their ratings could be ruined by being rude or black mailing or by not paying at all maybe they would be a little bit more considerate. However they can pretty much do whatever they want to the seller because they hold their reputation in the palm of their hand. I will not be selling on ebay anymore, yes my items got more view then with probably any other site but the frustration and headache and extreme charges are not worth it.",1,ebay.com

599,"To those of you considering using eBay to sell an item - DON'T!! I tried selling my $700 camera on eBay a few days ago. Yesterday, I received an email from eBay saying my item was ""sold"" and to ship the item. I reviewed the official looking email, and sent a request for payment. I then received an email 10 minutes later saying the item was paid for. Long story short, after shipping my camera, I called eBay and found out the email was fake. I got my camera back, was refunded the shipping cost, and the user was reported.  I re-listed my item to try again.  Today, I received another email from eBay stating that my item was SOLD. This time, I paid closer attention and did nothing until I saw payment was received in my PayPal. I sent the request for money, and this time something else happened... I not only received a fake email, branded at being from PayPal saying that they received payment (even though my PayPal account reflected no such activity), but I was also overwhelmed with text messages from a phone number claiming to be the ""buyer"" begging me to ship the package saying ""I paid, send me my camera."" After asking how they got my number and mentioning to them that their account was being reported and they were being blocked, they began blowing up my phone with pleads to send them the camera.  All in all, this is very, very frightening and disappointing knowing that such a well-known company such as eBay, has such poor security on their site. My personal information was released to these ""buyers"" and I was harassed by an unknown number. On top of that, my $700 camera was almost lost and sent to a scammer because of accounts being hacked and fake emails being sent to good people trying to sell their precious items.  I will NEVER be using eBay again, and I highly recommend no one else use their services.

607,"A customer purchased a ""high value"" item from my eBay page ($750.00 or more). It was shipped with insurance for the declared value of the purchase price. Item allegedly arrived damaged. Buyer received the item at a FedEx facility, removed it from the shipping carton and discarded the carton. He placed the large, 50lb item in his car and drove 45 miles to his home. He removed the item from the internal packing and messaged me to inform me that the item was damaged. I apologized for the inconvenience and proceeded to submit the shipping insurance claim using the documentation/images of the damaged item provided by the buyer. Obviously, I am at the mercy of the buyer providing the required information for the claim submission, or the lack thereof in this case. Insurance claims for shipping always require pictures of the outer package, the inner packing materials and of course the damaged item. Buyer claimed to notice slight damage to the outer shipping carton while he was at the FedEx facility where it was received, indicating that it had been dropped. However, he said nothing to facility personnel, and discarded the box. And later apologized for not noting the damage while he was there (if in fact there was damage). So, no outer carton pictures were provided. Consequently, the FedEx claim was denied for lack of evidence of a damaged shipping carton. So now, guess what? Yep! The seller has two options. Pay for the repairs to the item, (which declared insurance coverage would have sufficed), or accept a return and refund the buyer for the full purchase amount, along with return shipping as per all the information above. ($1100.00 USD total) Item was declared ""Not As Described"", as the item arrived damaged, at no fault of mine. The buyer had a fiduciary responsibility and HE failed, not me! The fault here lies on the buyer for not disclosing adequate information to produce a positive outcome to the insurance claim. Numerous messages were sent back and forth to eBay customer service stating that the buyer's negligence to produce adequate information resulted in the insurance claim denial. I thought, ""Yeah man, I got this thing beat!"" NOT! I submitted two written signed statements from the postal business center on their letterhead, where the item was shipped from. One stating that the package met required specifications for shipping, the other stating basically that the buyer did everything wrong and the seller did everything right. There was absolutely no swaying the decision of customer service to rule in my favor, even when creating reasonable doubt that the item was damaged prior to receipt (during shipping) as the buyer did not report any damage to the carton to FedEx, while he was still at the facility, which he had every opportunity to do so. The buyer failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the damage in fact did occur during shipping, hence the claim denial. I was ultimately held liable for the cost of repairs to the item which amounted to $800.00 USD. I guess I got lucky, as the buyer agreed to accept a partial refund for the cost of the repairs, The return shipping would have been $100.00 and refund of the $999.00 purchase price     Representation on the seller's side of eBay's bargaining table is non-existent in all ""Request To Return"" cases. The seller is always the bad guy no matter what and has absolutely no say in the ruling. NONE! ALL seller testimony was blatantly disregarded. If a case is opened against a seller by a buyer, don't waste your time fighting it. It won't do you any good. YOU WILL NOT WIN!      In a recent email I asked eBay's customer service, ""You obviously have the buyer protection program. Where do your seller protections lie?"" She said, ""The seller protection is the shipping insurance that you purchase."" Well, what good is that if the buyer doesn't provide adequate information to produce a positive outcome to a claim? And neglects to report shipping damage to a facility where he received the item? I exercised that protection. I was told by customer service that eBay has limited resources to provide a ruling on a case and shipping insurance was not one of those resources. WHAT? Their main limited resource is their narrow little minds!     As a result of this experience, I am no longer an eBay user, and neither is my wife, as she had a similar ""not as described"" experience. So, if you decide to become an eBay seller, this is what you can expect. Absolutely ZERO seller representation under the buyer protection program. Make your decision wisely. You have been warned!!!!!!!!",1,ebay.com

627,"As a seller or a buyer, you will sometimes end up with problems. And then you can try and use Ebay's automated system, but frankly it usually fails miserably. Calling and talking to customer service is a very long operation, and is hit or miss, and you can spend many hours doing this. On one item I bought I ended up calling a total of six times, and several times I was told one thing by one person, and a completely opposite thing by the next. Good information was rare. The people in the Philippines are much better than they used to be, but it's still common to get a really bad one. You have to be very persistent and find a good person which is getting harder and harder. - - Also, many items on Ebay are fakes. There are websites that help you figure out if what you are buying is a fake. And Ebay sells dangerous, illegal things. Earlier this week I had them take down an auction for an abortion drug, Mifepristone. Many illegal prescription drugs are for sale, although it varies greatly over time, as they do take some of them down. - -I just got them to take down about 100 auctions for an antibiotic that's by prescription only, but another one that's even stronger and more dangerous, even after three phone calls, they've not taken down over 50 auctions for it. The FDA confirmed it was illegal.- -Recently there were F-14 Tomcat military aircraft parts, and other apparently stolen military hardware. After reporting it, it's all still there. Calling the Dept. of Defense it was very hard to get someone to help but they finally looked at it and agreed ""It's illegal"". You can see the NSN numbers on a lot of these items, and they're not supposed to be sold to the public.- Attempting to report these things to US customs, the FDA, the FTC, FBI cyber crimes, and DHS, has met with utter failure after numerous tries since 2002. Attempting to get legislation through Congress has met with failure. -Magic the Gathering cards, a one billion dollar a year worldwide industry, many of the cards coming in from China are all fake. I've bought many of them, sent them to PSA and Beckett, all fake. Ebay still allows those sellers to sell. Also, reported dozens of auctions with fake fossils from China, Ebay took them all down, a week later they were all back up again by the same sellers. Rinse, repeat, called them several times, they took them down, they came right back. To this day they're all still there for sale, fake fossils from China. -I'm not an unhappy Ebay user, I'm a seller with a good rating.",1,ebay.com

629,"I always saw Ebay as this shady, grimy slum pit filled with nothing but dirty, crooked dealers looking for every which way to swindle people. One day, I was looking for something very specific and the best deal I could find was in this forbidden place I only dared to enter. With my walls up, I decided to ever so delicately step foot into it and maybe I could get in and out quickly without waking up the dragon. Well I was wrong, so wrong... All of the nightmares I've had about Ebay came true..so vividly I have a hard time believe it actually happened. I'd honestly rather overpay than buy anything through Ebay ever again. This is the seller I would like to warn you about: thejocur.  I never received my items, both this seller and Ebay has done NOTHING to help me. ZERO. Their claims of buyer protection guaranteed is illegal and should be taken down before it puts them in deeper waters. I paid the full amount for my item, I never received it. I was understanding of the possible glitches or delays that occur with certain shipping carriers. I went above and beyond what I could do, I talked to the shipping carrier headquarters, opened a criminal investigation with them, talked to the local carrier and the driver who had supposedly delivered the packages. I even called the local police and their central division, and also talked with a police detective. All of this was ONGOING/MID-INVESTIGATION and Ebay chose to close this case within 15 minutes..obviously Ebay doesn't give 2 cents about the buyers. To make matters worse, the seller had horrible business manners and extremely poor communication skills. He/she was attempting to start some kind of blame game and pushing away all responsibility like a 5 year old getting caught selling bad lemonade. I would have expected a lot more from someone who has been doing business on Ebay for 18 years. It is a fact that I never received my item, and the seller had no professionalism and extremely poor communication skills during this matter (evidenced in messages). Additionally, it was 100% dishonest practice to be charged for something I never received. I wanted to express these FACTS in a negative feedback, but guess what? Ebay removed it not even after 1 minute. I wrote no profanity, and merely stated the aforementioned TRUE facts to warn others about the seller. Now what does that tell you?

633,"Has anyone been following ALL THE RECENT POLICY CHANGES AT EBAY? IN THE LAST WEEK THIS IS 2 THINGS I ENCOUNTERED: 1) FAKE SALE! UPON SINGING INTO EBAY, THERE WAS A PRESIDENTS DAY SALE AD THAT FEATURED PUMA BRAND SHOES AT 50% OFF! I LIKED THE PAIR IN THE IMAGE SO I FOLLOWED TO THE ITEM PAGE WHICH WAS ACTUALLY THE PUMA INC EBAY STORE. THERE THE SHOES WERE MARKED AT $35 WHICH W-A-S HALF OFF THE $70 DOLLAR ORIGINAL PRICE.... HOWEVER THERE WERE SIZES AND STYLES. WHEN YOU SELECTED THE STYLE THAT WAS AD FEATURED....SURPRISE THE CHECKOUT PRICE WAS N-O-T 50% OFF BUT THE ORIGINAL $70. THERE WAS NO ADJUSTMENT AT REGISTER EITHER SO I BACKED OUT AND FILED AN ITEM REPORT WHICH WENT NOWHERE BECAUSE EBAY COULD CARE LESS ABOUT AN ACTUAL CONSUMER IN THE LIGHT OF AN ENTITY THAT GENERATES A FEW THOUSAND FEES FOR THEM YEARLY. IS THIS FAIR? NO. CONSUMER LAWS ARE INTACT AND SHOULD COVER CYBER COMMERCE WITHIN THE AMERICAN BORDERS ELECTRONIC OR NOT. 2) I WAS SHOPPING FOR CELL PHONES AND HAPPEN TO LIKE AND RETAIN MY OLDER SAMSUNG MODEL SLIDER PHONE. I ALSO KEEP A BACKUP JUST IN CASE AND RECENTLY HAD TO RESORT TO MY BACKUP AND ALTHOUGH IT WAS LIKE NEW, THESE THINGS TEND TO PLAY OUT AT BAD TIMES SO I WANTED TO GET A BACKUP ASAP. I FOUND ONE AND IT WAS BUNDLED WITH ANOTHER SAMSUNG PHONE OF A DIFFERENT MODEL A GENERATION OR SO NEWER. THE STARTING BID PRICE WAS SET AT $20. I SENT A MESSAGE TO THE SELLER TO CONFIRM THESE WERE ATT&T USEABLE PHONES AND WAS CONFIRMED.  SALE END WAS A WEEK AWAY SO I WAITED UNTIL CLOSER TO END TO BID. I FORGOT TO BOOKMARK THE ITEM BUT DECIDED I COULD ACCESS IT VIA MY MESSAGE BOX AND DID SO. IN MY MESSAGE BOX THE STARTING BID WAS STILL A $20 ITEM. WHEN I WENT TO THE PAGE IT WAS DOUBLED......AND I FIGURED A BIDDING WAR WAS GOING AND WAS ABOUT TO FORGO THE THING WHEN I NOTICED THE SHIPPING HAD DOUBLED TOO!  SO I LOOK THE AD OVER AND THERE WERE N-O BIDDERS! SOMEHOW THE SELLER WAS ALLOWED TO COMPLETELY ALTER THE AD ANYWAY HE PLEASED TO CHEAT A BUYER OUT OF BIDDING. EBAY AFTER NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS DID NOTHING.  THEN WE GET TO FEEDBACK.....DID YOU KNOW YOU CANNOT FEEDBACK EBAY? TWITTER AND EVERYONE ELSE ALL HAVE A SITE FEEDBACK TAB/OPTION AND THIS ALLOWS FOR SUGGESTIONS AS WELL AS JUST COMPLAINTS. EBAY HAS DECIDED IT SIMPLY DOESNT CARE ABOUT US SO WHY SHOULD WE CARE ABOUT THEM? CUSTOMER SERVICE ONLY IS FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE AND SELLERS GET A BETTER ACCESS AND SOMETIMES ITS JUST STUPID.  LAST YEAR I BOUGHT A $5 ITEM AND GOT AN EMAIL A FEW DAYS AFTER PAYING IT HAD SHIPPED....WITH A DELIVERY DATE OF SOME 2 MONTHS LATER. WHAT? I CONTACTED THE SELLER WHO AFFIRMED TO ME THE ITEM INDEED HAD SHIPPED. SO I FIGURED THE TIME ESTIMATE WAS A COMPUTER THING AND NONREALISTIC......UNTIL LIKE WEEK 5 AND NO ITEM. PAYPAL ONLY ALLOWS REFUNDS UP TO LIKE 45 DAYS AND 2 MONTHS WAS BEYOND THAT SO I ATTEMPTED TO CONFIRM A DELIVERY TIME AND GOT NONE... SO I CONTACTED PAYPAL AND CANCELLED THE SALE. I BEING THE HONEST PERSON I AM, IF THE ITEM ARRIVED WOULD HAVE CONTACTED AND PAYPALLED VIA EMAIL. THAT WAS MUTE BECAUSE THE ITEM NEVER CAME.  SO AFTER 4 MONTHS I REALIZED BY MESSAGE FROM EBAY I HAD NOT LEFT A FEEDBACK...SO I DID> A NEGATIVE ONE, AND OMG DID THIS GUY FLIP. BUT I NEVER GOT THE ITEM. HE ATTEMPTED AN EBAY DISPUTE WHICH IS THE NEXT NIGHTMARE.... IT SEEMS SELLERS CAN DISPUTE VIA EBAY WHILE THE REST OF US ARE RELEGATED TO PAYPAL ONLY. IT TOOK SEVERAL ATTEMPTS, BUT FINALLY AFTER BASICALLY TRYING TO PUSH ME INTO REVERSING MY FFEDBACK (WHICH I DIDNT KNOW WAS POSSIBLE), EBAY REALIZED THAT N-O ITEM WAS SENT OR RECEIVED.  EBAY TODAY IS SIMPLY NOT A TRUSTWORTHY WEBSITE AND WE ALL MUST ACT ACCORDINGLY TO THIS. IT IS HOWEVER A NECCESSARY EVIL.  SHOP THERE WITH A GRAIN OF SALT IN EVERYTHING, AND AVOID VEHICLE PURCHASES VIA EBAY LIKE THE PLAGUE! ITS ALL SCAMS AND EBAY REFUSES TO GET INVOLVED.  ALSO BEWARE OF FAKE SALES AND CHECKOUT PRICE ADJUSTMENTS AS WELL AS SHIPPING CHARGE PRICE JUMPING.  WITH A LITTLE HELP, EBAY COULD BE REALLY NICE. I WONT HOLD MY BREATH. -KEVIN",1,ebay.com

What kind of policy is that? EBAY doesn't care about their members, only their profits they get from you on each transaction. These VERO participants don't even have to prove their case, just file the complaint and the seller suffers for no reason. You get your account suspended without cause, or no fault of you own, and even when you prove that, if the VERO participant never lifts the claim, you stay suspended. No other recourse for resolution period! No chance to even defend yourself. They say hire a lawyer..over a $10 item. How sloppy is this? IT is ignorant. Maybe a better online auction site will show up and put EBAY out of business with some serious competition.",1,ebay.com
636,"I decided to sell some items I bought on eBay. Guess what? My account was restricted a few times and was shut down because of Authenticity violation. ALL items (a few Chanel earrings and bracelets, Chanel scarves, Chanel purse, Burberry scarves, t-shirts and other high brand clothes) are FAKE. EBay suggested me to contact sellers and ask for reimbursement. I did. No result! But I have to be fair and to say that every time I've called eBay every person I've spoken with was very polite. The only problem is that no one could help with my issue :)))! Needless to say that besides sounds of dollars thrown away on eBay I stuck with all the crap I bought!",1,ebay.com
637,"eBay continues to disappoint... Back in eBay's early days they had a lot of problems and it seems all these years later they have come full circle with many of the same problems. eBay formerly jumped on sellers with high shipping costs and who did not accurately describe their goods. I just recently bought a new old stock stereo component from them. It is a good example of how they let people mess with you. First the item was described as new old stock which it is. But the seller said everything worked but it did not. The key here was the machine both plays and records but the seller did not test to see if it recorded yet posted it as working fine. So if you should buy make certain the seller answers any questions you have before you bid. Another big turn off is shipping cost. My item cost $25 to ship as it is heavy but I point out similar sellers are charging as much as $75 for economy shipping for it which in some cases is 50% or more of the asking price. This is wrong and should be addressed by eBay who could care less. The next problem was the ass did not know how to pack my item. Its was heavy yet loosely packed in the shipping box. When it arrived the front was caved in. I'm lucky that I can fix such things and managed to fix the damage caused by bad packaging. Unfortunately this is a rather common problem. Earlier in the year a clueless gal sold me an old bottle. I asked her to carefully pack it but she used one wrap of the pimple sized bubble wrap then put in in a too large box. It arrived in shards. The gal not only lost her bottle but had to refund my shipping and purchase price which she did under threat of filing a claim against her. If you get taken file a claim listing the item not as described in most cases eBay will give your money back even if the seller won't. Some sellers try to ignore complaints but back when I sold on eBay I made certain my customers were treated the way I wanted to be treated. eBay needs to get real with questionable dealers but there are good dealers there too. I always check for two things before I bid one is their feedback. If they have a problem and then diss the buyer I skip them regardless how good they look as bad attitude is a sign of a bad dealer. I agree eBay customer service is nothing I don't understand why they have the agents since they are non responsive. Even with this if you go through the steps and file a claim item not as received you will probably get a refund. But then the bigger issue is do you want to waste your time trying to buy there when it might not be as described, might arrive damaged and you will only get BS when you try to talk to eBay customer service.",1,ebay.com

639,"I sell about 430 items on eBay (zellajake), and will generate about $19,000 in fees for them in 2016. There is practically no seller protection. All buyers have 100% positive feedback, no matter their countenance or criminal intentions. As a seller, you literally cannot leave negative feedback for a buyer, which renders buyer feedback scores precisely worthless. Meanwhile, a buyer can leave negative feedback for a seller for absolutely no reason. Most of our negative feedback is derived from USPS failure to deliver, and the buyer is NOT even made to contact the seller to work out the issue. EBay customer support will say, ad verbatum "" the buyer is entitled to their opinion"". So if you don't mind not having any control whatsoever over your own feedback, and you don't have a problem with not being able to expose criminal and abhorrent buyers, eBay is your site. And now on to my current complaint. We collect and grow a lot of our own supply, and therefore, there is no ""product identifier"" information to give. As of Feb 28th, 32 of our ads are going to get booted off of eBays auctions. Really? $19,000 in revenues and you will simply pinch us off? Their reasoning is that it gives the seller better product recognition. Given eBay's revenues from our sales, I don't believe that we need this coerced assistance. How about eBay sticks to collecting the fees, and let us sellers do what we do best...sell. I am very actively seeking alternative sites like Amazon, Etsy, and Bonanza. I'll immediately set the 32 ads up on those sites, then expand to our other products after that. If you, eBay, aren't loyal, you aren't getting our hard-earned commisions. EBay is getting worse, and worse, and worse.",1,ebay.com

I called Ebay several times and 1st argued they should insist he not inconvenience me anymore over his fraudulent products, but then argued they should get the pills to see that he is a defrauding people. They refused but these ideas but said I had 30 days to return it, and was protected by buyer protection. I was finally able to get to a printer when I find that the case was resolved in his favor. AND MY FEED BACK WARNING TO OTHERS WAS REMOVED. They lied to me about how many days I had to return it. People are relying on that Coq10 to replace what's lost due to aging and/or statin drugs. Ebay has chosen to help sellers defraud people. I've spent a hrs on this already and now have to go on to a credit card fight. Amazon has resolved issues in 1 short phone call.

After dealing with many many unethical and dishonest people with no support from customer service I began to use my ""Cancel Order"" option to avoid being screwed since I knew eBay would not protect me. I had a 99.3% positive feedback rating with the only negative feedback coming from a dishonest customer who got his money back and kept my item which eBay refused to address. I gave away merchandise just to avoid any defects on my seller rating. Without a prior warning or email to let me know what was happening I received a below standard rating for having a 3.5% defect rate as a result of cancelled orders. Ebay reduced my account to ashes taking away my listings and moving my listings to very far down on the search listings. When I tried to cancel my account after 7 very frustrating phone calls I was told that I couldn't cancel my account while it was below standard. So now I have an eBay account which does not sell anything but still charges me all of the fees and I am helpless to do anything. There is absolutely no protection for sellers!!!

644,"I won a DSLR camera and went to pay immediately. PayPal declined both of my cards multiple times and I've never had problems with payment outside of PayPal. I even paid through the guest PayPal successfully a few times, having made another purchase on Ebay recently.  I called PayPal customer service to find out apparently I had an unverified account from when I boycotted them years ago for refusing to verify. I told them I had closed that SIX YEARS AGO and the one time I come back it's a problem. They closed the account but I still had problems, so they recommended I request a PayPal invoice from the seller. The whole time this is happening I've been communicating with the seller and it's only been a few minutes. I request the invoice and tell them I have to go to a meeting and will be back within 4 hours. 4 hours later the first thing in my email box is a messaging asking if I was going to pay and threatening to repost.  I told them to have some patience and hold on a second, they need to respond to my communication and send the invoice I requested before they jump to abrupt conclusions. My further messages were ignored and they cancelled and reposted the listing within FIVE MINUTES, only FOUR HOURS after I won. If you don't even give a buyer 24 hours to purchase the item you're a TERRIBLE SELLER. A flake that didn't really want to sell it! So I left a negative feedback, reported the relisting to Ebay for false listing (he would not sell it, it was a ""fishhook"" as they call it). Then I posted a warning in the Ebay community. Username is cudenver. He had the nerve to request me alter the Feedback without communicating to resolve the situation whatsoever. Meanwhile, I'm looking at various community discussions and the top tags are ""scam"" and ""seller"", with buyers complaining about terrible things that happened to them and people in the community saying it's their fault! There was NO accountability and NO integrity in the group. Then I get responses blaming me as well, and saying my post would be removed for ""shaming and naming"". Because warning people about a bad seller and giving them bad publicity as a consequence of their actions is not allowed. Within minutes of the discussion my voice in the conversation was cut off as the post was removed by a mod.

PayPal had no problems processing over a thousand dollars worth of my purchases from a store in New Jersey, so it must be the Hurst Texas location they do not like. No business should get away with being allowed to discriminate like that! Shame on eBay! Shame on PayPal! Everyone should disconnect from PayPal at once.",1,ebay.com

I called customer service and to my surprise they are in a foreign country who were relatively rude. In addition, the advice they give you is not in line with the great customer service you will received with Amazon or Jet.com.

If I didnt get my money by Friday to recall the hurry up and wait/listen to music line at 866-540-3229 located in a foreign country; and that they would take some type of other action. In short, the refund process at Ebay is FOGGY and leaves you with a feeling something is awry. I assure you after I get my money back, if I ever do, EBAY is history from this AMERICAN BUYER.

I thought it was a reputable place to shop and they stood behind their customers when things did not go as planned. However, I found out the hard way that the money back guarantee that they speak of did now exist in my case and they took a hands off approach and only cared about themselves and making a dishonest dollar. I purchased over $600.00 in Olive Garden Gift Cards for Christmas Gifts through eBay, only to find out that when the people  went to use the cards they were empty and had no value on them because they were sold on eBay by a vendor who had used a stolen credit card to purchase the cards for resale and when I spoke to the Olive Garden's Corporate Office, the issuer of the cards, they informed me that they had cancelled all the cards that had been purchased by this vendor through fraud. When I went back to eBay regarding this bad transaction seeking their intervention and reimbursement for the money I had lost, I was told by eBay, that they could not refund me any money because I purchased them using my bank funds and did not buy the cards using my Pay Pal account and so I was out of $600.00 hard earned dollars and they did not seem to have any sense of responsibility or care about it at all.

Here is another example, a lipstick shaped purse that she says is "" incredibly unique"" and just sold for $56 (see item 151894710937 ) is always available brand new for $12 from a variety of Chinese sellers (see 252072705996 for example). In looking through her auction history I have found countless examples of her ""estate"" items being readily available new for $6 or so dollars by countless Chinese sellers, this includes some of her ""designer"" items (like Oscar de la Renta necklaces she's sold for hundreds of dollars, they are ""signed"" with only a hang tag that's made from a color of metal that doesn't match the necklace. You can find the same necklaces selling for $10 from China, only the Chinese sellers don't pretend their are designer).

This practice I have seen without exception in many product catorgories over the last 15 months.

It was stated in my listing that I don't do returns, so I denied the request for the reason of buyer's remorse. They proceeded to ship the item back to me outside of eBay anyways. I called eBay multiple times and was assured that since the error was the buyer's and the return case was closed that there was nothing they could do to possibly pull the funds from my account. I didn't need to return the coat to them, but I still got in touch with them to try. The buyer then sent me money out of the blue to overnight the coat to the other side of the country, but I refunded that money since I wasn't able to change the shipping address on PayPal. They then re-sent the money demanding that I ship to Canada and didn't understand why it couldn't be done through ebay's international shipping program. It was an e-check that would take a week to clear, so I told them that I'd have to wait for that. They were incredibly uncooperative and when I finally said I would ship, they went and filed a claim on PayPal that the coat was ""significantly not as described"" (which was a lie, as documented by their messages on eBay) and forced a full refund in their favor. The claim was closed within 24 hours. I spent the next 3 days on hold with eBay explaining the situation and was told that there was no way that the return should have happened because it was a case of buyer's remorse, but that eBay had no power and the refund was done by PayPal. I finally got through to PayPal and was told that this decision was absolutely final and in the buyer's favor because the item had been returned and in my possession, so it's automatically a refund for the buyer. They not only got a full refund, but also the original $15 I paid to ship AND the seller fees I had to pay eBay, since the return wasn't documented on eBay. I lost $40 in this situation and feel like nobody at eBay had any power to do anything and I just got lost in a mess of transfers. I would be on hold for a few hours and then finally get through to someone, explain my story all over again, and then get transferred to someone who had no idea what was happening but who couldn't transfer me back the other way, so I'd have to hang up and wait on hold again for a few hours to try again. I had spent a so much of my time being assured by eBay that I did nothing wrong and the buyer was messing up right and left, but then being told by PayPal that eBay has no power and was just ""giving me false hope.""

715,"Whoever told you that you can't get something for nothing flat out lied to you! Don't think so? Go buy anything on Ebay. It won't matter the situation, you will get all your money back. Why? Because the dumb $#*!s at Ebay think it's the buyers that make their world go around. They haven't figured out yet that it's a 50/50 contribution between buyers and sellers. If you've never sold anything on Ebay, spare yourself the heartache and flat out injustice and don't start. If you do decide to sell something, be prepared for practices that mirror the IRS. If your buyer doesn't want the item you shipped them for ANY reason, you are paying to have it shipped back to you no matter what. If you don't send them a prepaid label, Ebay will take it upon themselves to send one on your behalf. That's right. They will charge you for the return label. Now you are out not only what you paid to ship it to them, you are also out what is costs to get it back from them. Had enough yet? No? There's more. What you will find is that you have no way to give a negative feedback to ANY buyer under ANY circumstance. On the other hand, if you piss the buyer off whether it's valid or not, you will get a negative feedback. Once your positive feedback falls to a very strict percentage, you are done selling. You want to talk about fees? It will cost you 10% plus listing fees which are usually under a dollar. There's more. You will also be charged 10% of whatever you charge your customer to ship the item to them. That's right. If you charge $30 to ship your item, Ebay is taking 10% of that too. Now it wouldn't be complete if Paypal didn't come and take 4% of the total transaction too. So yes, you will lose 14% of the money that is sent to you. Like Walmart or not, they have it figured out. It's not about how much they make per item, it's about selling as many as you can by reducing the margins. There are over 100 million Ebay members. So do the math. If each of those sell one item per month and it costs them only $1 to sell their item, there's $100 million for Ebay. This is an unrealistic number obviously because the sales are beyond your imagination. I have no problem with people making money. But at what point does the greed end. The fees just don't quit. It will cost you $125 to list a car whether it sells or not. Do you have any idea how many vehicles are listed at any given time. So just like the government, big pharma, the FDA, the power companies, you have legalized criminal activity. I will add more later. Yep, there's more. I noticed someone posted a question/concern about a buyer wanting to return an item simply because they changed their mind even though the seller didn't offer returns on that particular item. Let me help the sellers that this hasn't happened to yet. All a buyer has to do is say the item wasn't as described. The seller is taking it back. And they are going to pay for the return shipping back to them too. Yep. If the seller doesn't provide a return label to the buyer, Ebay will take it upon themselves to provide the buyer with one and they will immediately deduct it from you paypal account. So you, the seller, are out the monies it costed you to send it to them and to get it back from them. If you stated that you don't offer returns and they changed their mind, the buyer may have to pay the shipping back to you. But if they say it's not as described, the return bill is yours. This is good information for the millions of people out there that have the integrity of the IRS to buy things, swap it out with yours that doesn't work, and send it back to the seller at their expense because it ""wasn't as described"". Don't think it happens? It happens everyday. I've sold about 3000 items on Ebay in the last 15 years and it's happened about ten times. That isn't that many you say? I'm one seller. There are over 120 million registered Ebayers. Do the math. If you are a seller, make sure you take pictures of your items that aren't necessarily shown in your item description. Why? Because then the buyer doesn't know that you can readily identify your item against the one he sends back to you claiming it doesn't work. It doesn't work; and that's because it's his broken unit that he sent back to you and he has kept your working unit. More to come-stay tuned.",1,ebay.com

I told him the truth, that the coat was not used, it has been in a closet. Ebay didn't bother to look or read the emails. When I called she told me that they have to side with the buyer.

727,"Ebay.com is the WORST site out there for selling used items. I would strongly urge people to find a different site or method if they are considering selling online. It isn't a question of IF u get scammed by dishonest buyers, it's WHEN! With the new ""buyer protection policy,"" Ebay.com has allowed dishonest buyers to rob the sellers. You see, if a buyer has buyer's remorse all they have to do is open an ""item not as described"" case. It doesn't matter if the seller says ""no returns or refunds."" It doesn't matter if the item is accurately described in the listing and photos. It does not matter if the item in question is being sold as is, for parts, or repair. None of that matters. Ebay.com will ALWAYS side with the buyer, and force the seller to take a refund. Oh, and they usually also force the seller to pay for return shipping! Let me tell you my personal story regarding this. I have been an Ebay.com member for 10 years and have been selling for just over 4 years. I am your average small seller. I sell vintage items from my own personal collection when I really need some extra money. A few weeks ago, I listed an antique item on Ebay.com. This item was from the 1920's, so it did have some wear and tear. I took several close up photos at every different angle to show the damage and imperfections. I pointed out the damage in my listing, even going as far to say - ""the damage can be seen in photo number 5."" I also stated that I would be more than happy to answer questions, provide more info or photos if any bidder was unsure of the piece. I did get a few questions regarding this item. I was brutally honest in my messages - just as I had been in the listing when describing the damage. I believe it put some buyers off, but I am completely honest about the condition of the things I sell. A week went by and the item sold for about $70. The winning bidder had asked no questions about the item at all. I sent him a message thanking him for his fast payment and informing him I would mail the item the next day. He did not reply to the message at all. The buyer received the item within 3 days. That day, he began messaging me. He was very rudely accusing me of selling junk. He was furiously complaining about the EXACT DAMAGE AND IMPERFECTIONS THAT WERE SHOWN IN THE DESCRIPTION AND PHOTOS! He did not read the description OR view photos before impulse bidding. I refused a refund or a return for buyer's remorse. I have no problem with returns or refunds in general, I have given them in the past for items that were lost in the mail. But this was ridiculous! I don't see why I should have to refund or take a return for something that was completely 100% accurately described just because he couldn't be bothered to read the description or view the photos. Anyway, after he found out I would not be intimidated by his demands or rude behavior, he threatened me, ""followed"" me on my Ebay profile and left negative feedback. I reported him to Ebay.com for abusing the buyer protection policy, leaving false feedback, and harassment/threats. NOTHING was done. The buyer then opens a return case. My Paypal funds are instantly froze. Again, I refuse to refund or return an item for buyer's remorse. I assume the case will be escalated to Ebay, so I begin writing a statement, gathering information, and making a solid case in my favor. Another week goes by and as expected, the case was escalated to customer support. Well, Ebay.com did NOT ASK ME ANYTHING! They did NOT ask for my side of the story! They did not give me any way to reply to the case or defend myself and instead RULED IN FAVOR OF THE LYING BUYER! The case was escalated, Ebay supposedly ""reviewed"" it (although, I strongly believe it is done by a computer, not a real person), and the buyer was immediately rewarded with a return , even though I REFUSED SEVERAL TIMES. If anyone at Ebay had bothered to look at the listing they could clearly see the item was 100% accurately described! Nothing was left out at all. The photos were spot on perfect. Oh, and this is where it gets really interesting! The item returns to me - BROKEN! Because the *** buyer couldn't be bothered to pack it properly. So I contact ebay, asking for reimbursement since their forced return is the reason for the item being broken. They say I have no proof and they can't take my word for it. REALLY? I have video proof! The item did NOT look like that when it left my home. But oh no, sellers are *** of the earth to ebay. Ebay will never take a seller's word for anything, even when they have proof. If you are a seller, no amount of proof will help you win a case. But if one of their precious angelic buyer's says something is damaged, it is taken as ABSOLUTE TRUTH WITH NO PROOF NEEDED. (And don't even get me started on their customer support! They will pass you from one person to the next, each saying something different, but none being any help whatsoever. Total waste of time.) Needless to say, I am completely DONE with this disgusting website/company. I will never sell on Ebay.com ever again. I will not buy anything on this site or even consider browsing it ever again. I will be encouraging everyone I know to stop using it as well. I have had great success with this so far, after telling my experience. I will now be closing my account and selling any unwanted items on another website (which has much lower fees), locally or donating them to charity.",1,ebay.com

I had used same packaging. I had to be guided by post office charges, it was not up to me! When I contacted seller they said it was faulty but they wouldn't refund full postage , only £3.57 , so I am £8 out for pocket because seller sent me broken clock. I contacted seller and they said I should have gone through eBay to return it, it would only have costed £2.99. Too late now. I rang eBay and they said returns postage costs was up to seller and buyer, they couldn't help.........

I had evidence that gift card was full. They said it didn't matter what the truth was, whether the card had money or not. In their opinion I did not work with the buyer enough to show them ""how to use the product"". SO after MUCH hassle and headache I was left with a review saying I sold an empty gift card, regardless of proof opposite. I thought I did everything by the book, and I still got screwed. It didn't matter who was ""right"", only that the incompetent person who couldn't figure out how to use a gift card didn't receive proper ""help"" from me. Bad review stands.

I called them recently to try to get it removed because I really need to start selling on there again, and I was told that it was permanent and that I should sell on a different auction site but i could still buy on eBay! Are you kidding me? The customer service guy I spoke to was not helpful at all and for most of the call just kept repeating himself instead of giving me actual information. When I finally got a bit angry he finally told me that they were revoked because one of my accounts was caught trying to get around eBay policies, but would not tell me which ones, and would not let me do a thing to fix it. Now, if this was a second or third strike I probably would never have tried to get my selling privileges back, however I have NEVER been banned, suspended, had listings deleted, or gotten into ANY trouble in the years I was using eBay before this happened.

748,Ebay has no consideration what-so-ever for the seller. A buyer can return an item even if the seller does not accept returns and the description was 100% accurate. Whenever a buyer returns an item whether you accept returns or not it affects your seller rating which can cause more fees to be charged as well as less views for your item. Ebay charges 10% of your total sales as it is which is outrageous for how poor their customer service is towards sellers. Also it takes hours just to reach an Ebay representative over the phone who will more than likely have no answer towards your problem. They will most likely tell you that you are just $#*!ed. Worst site you could possibly sell on. They definitely need new management as well as a change to their Ebay policies. With how $#*!ty their customer service is they should be charging no more than 5% of total sales.

This is why i left them and never again bought or sold ever again.thats another story. i was making 5k a month part time while i was still working full time.anyways i think ebay is being run by many small sellers and you have the big company like target china warehouse,bestbuy you will see outlet items from them.they are the one that are making it with no issue with ebay. if you notice its the smaller group seller that are having more issue with ebay the policy and rules and many dishonest buyers filing. buying or selling is like 50% you might get a bad seller or 50% of the time you might get a bad buyer. ebay is getting very sloppy on there policy. and now you see many seller leaving ebay and going to other website. evilbay is a mess. just watch this fall and see how bad it will get ebay will get many returns and many buyers filing a chargeback after knowingly receiving a refund. look at the stock market for evilbay going down! and many seller selling fake and stolen items on ebay. people wake up! there remains a renewed and growing conviction that the decline of eBay's core operations is starting all over again.

783,"Here are ten new signs the auction bully is dying... No matter what ingenious new tricks eBay comes up with to manipulate their users, the Internet giant continues to fall behind in the race to outrun its avalanche of angry users. The site is now experiencing its lowest rating of trust since a series of aftershocks that continue to rock eBay ever since their disastrous facelift of 2008. And here's how they're doing it. For years, they naively hoped the fallout from that self-inflicted gunshot would have blown east and been forgotten, but the hits from those catastrophic decisions just keep on a-comin'. Here are the latest Top Ten on eBay's ""Hit Parade of Self-Destructive Mistakes"". 1. Following on the heels of stratospheric fee increases that drove hundreds of thousands of sellers off the site, this latest round of bad decisions began when they masked all users' ID's from the listings. After February, 2008, eBay buyers and sellers would only see scrambled anagrams where user's screen names used to be.  2. Next, they compromised the Feedback scoring system. The misleading way it works today is that all of a seller's complaints are automatically laundered from the mathematics after twelve months. That means as far as eBay is concerned, any prolific thief with a despicable track record only needs to wait twelve months and all is forgiven. What may have been a 62% score due to excessive complaints suddenly becomes a 100% score - or a false reading of fresh cleanliness - after 12 months when the timer is reset. 3. Then, they removed the bidder's search feature. That kept the growing wave of users who were suspicious of fraudulent activity, from tracking and identifying illegal bidding activity. 'Shill' bidding is an age-old, unethical and highly illegal auction trick which eBay only flaccidly discouraged, but which they now aggressively promote (since it can no longer be traced) as a way of injecting revenue into sagging profits. The way it works is, the seller gets his family and friends to place fake bids. Then, when the high bid reaches what the seller wants for the item, the fake bidders step back and let legitimate bidders take over. The winning bidder never knows who was bidding, or if they were even legitimate, and he ends up paying many times what the item would have sold for without the fake (shill) bids. 4. Next, they launched a nebulous program to phase out all contact between buyers and sellers. The ''Ask a Question"" button disappeared from the main body of the listing, and ended up buried toward the bottom of the page, among the fine print and legalese. Buyers can still make contact, but their inquiries (and sellers' replies) are audited and users' emails scrambled. And these Mafiosos are dead serious: if a conversation goes past two emails, the buyer will usually get a threatening email warning from eBay, often followed by a telephone call with bullying and more threats. The bewildered buyer is then drop-kicked from the site ""for abusing"" the 'Ask a Question' feature. 5. The Item Number identifying the listing has also disappeared from plain view, and can only be found, literally, by using a high-intensity magnifying glass.  6. Frustrated they could no longer make casual contact with sellers, buyers began relying more and more on the seller's feedback score rating, which included how often complaints are logged, dates of entries and how long the seller has been active. But now all those revealing features have been removed - either buried in more off-page 'drill-down' or eliminated altogether.  7. Another compromise reflects eBay's seductive efforts to keep buyers from looking at the listing, once the item has been paid for. On every reference after the sale, from emails to Leave Feedback to the My eBay page, all links to the item's description have been removed. Apparently, eBay concluded, bidders might get ""buyer's remorse"", so not only is the listing software scrambled so the listing won't print once the sale has ended, buyers are further discouraged from even referring back to it. This is an especially effective way to keep buyers from comparing the listing details against the item, when it doesn't look right after it's been received. 8. Finally, watch out for eBay's new ""fake opinion link"". This button usually appears somewhere around the Feedback pages and asks how you like the new changes. If you fall for this trick, you click on it and up pops a dialog box for comments. But - surprise! - there's no 'submit' button. It's a hoax page that can't be submitted to anyone, and it will remain on your screen until you cancel it, unsent. 9. The cumulative results of all this finally had a whiplash effect: the loss of all personal communication has turned users into nameless, faceless robots who feel no obligation for truth, honesty or courtesy. And that isn't boding well for their folksy ""thank you for being part of the eBay family"".  10. A 19-year eBay employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said eBay's eventual goal is to scrub all identifying data about buyers and sellers, leaving only the item being sold and eBay's own profit-driven payment software. That means names, locations, complaints, dates, feedback, seller ratings and questions will gradually disappear from the site, leaving the buyer-victim alone on a dark, slippery slope with the anonymous person he's about to deal with. ""The plan launched in 2008 was to implement these changes slowly, so as not to create another stampede from the site,"" the source said, drawing on the analogy of putting a frog into a pot of water and letting it come to a gradual boil. ""It was structured to be a ten-year plan, but it appears that may be extended,"" he said, declining to explain further. When questioned about increasing complaints of eBay sellers making deliberately false representations about everything from toys, antiques, electronics and auto parts, to sellers mailing a paper picture of an expensive item the bidder believed he was actually buying, the source deflected the question saying only, ""Buyers always have the option of returning something if they aren't happy."" Predictably, eBay's own recent polls reflect the lowest level of seller trust in the site's twenty-year history.  He then made a reference to the eBay Buyer Protection Program. But hundreds of thousands of bidders aren't happy with that protection, citing fine print that excludes virtually everything, which fact only comes to light when there's a problem. If something ever does qualify, it's usually an inexpensive item, and then it's only covered under a narrowly defined, highly irregular set of circumstances.  As for eBay, it doesn't appear there's any turning back. Jiminy Cricket said it best: ""You buttered your bread, now sleep in it,"" meaning, you've made your own mess, take care of it yourself.

784,"I'VE BEEN A SELLER FOR 17 YEARS WITH 100% FB AND HAVE SEEN THE SITE DETERIORATE SIGNIFICAN'TLY OVER THE YEARS.

795,"If you intend to sell books thru Half.com, please be warned and advised. This site does not care about sellers. They cancelled our selling account after 10 years of long standing good history, because of a supposed shipping violation; they never explained the violation even though we requested explanation several times. Only possible communication with them is via email (they call themselves ""an online company""); the online customer representative was very rude and not helpful, ignored all our questions or concerns and simply kept referring us to their ""help"" pages. Since half.com accounts link to eBay.com, this caused our eBay.com account to also be blocked, which is a totally different site with different policies. This blocks seller activity also on the other site, and doesn't even let you use the account for buying any product; but half.com did not care about helping resolve the situation. The eBay people tried to help but they could not do anything about the already blocked account. On top of this half.com does not immediately pay seller revenues, as policy they only pay twice a month and they provide no option for requesting immediate payment if you are in urgent need of the money. So upon cancelling an account like they did to us, they place your pending payments on a 60-day hold period, which we doubt is legal. After 60 days when you try to reclaim the frozen funds they come up with another list of hurdles and ""account identity validations"" in order to release your money. In our case we did not have any extra identity validations to do since our account had current up-to-date information, so then the customer representative simply stopped responding to our email requests for payment. (There is no way to contact them via phone). We had to call ebay for advise, the provided a phone number for half.com 800-545-9857, when you call this number it is an endless loop voice response system that never connects you to a real person. So, when there is a problem with this people, there is no simple way to resolve issues and you are stuck, and THEY ARE EXTREMELY DISREGARDING AND DISRESPECTING OF SELLERS, who are THE ONES WHO ALLOW THEM TO EARN THE STEEP FEES they charge on every book sale.

806,"This is why I really dislike ebay: Literally no support as a seller and they fee you three separate times when selling. 1st when you post the item, 2nd when it sells, and 3rd when PayPal charges you after transferring the money. (PayPal is owned by ebay) - They know they have the largest amount of viewers looking to buy items, and that they're the largest online auctioning website. So they can get away with being tyrants, and feeing the crap out of hard working sales people. - Also their policies are terrible!! Heres an example of their return policy; Lets just say you sell an item for $500 that you've bought for $350. You've just instantly lost $50 off that from the ""10% roughly"" selling fee, and have also lost ""lets just say $10"" for the insertion fee. Then to add on top of that they'll take about 3% off the $500 for PayPal fees, thus making you lose a total of $75 (so even if there wasn't a customer return you'd only make $75 profit). Where I'm getting at with this is that if a customer decides to return that item for some reason, ebay will automatically give them a FULL refund of $500 out of YOUR pocket.. Thus making you lose $75 for no reason what so ever besides having that item listed and getting it back.. - In my opinion both ebay and Paypal should also give the seller their money back for all three fee's they've charged them. But why would they care when they already have your money in their pockets and there's nothing you can do about it because you've already agreed to the terms and conditions? Hmm...",1,ebay.com

I'm a single mother so I worked my butt off and saved up just enough for this phone. With Cricket being bought out by AT&T, phones that are not GSM capable will not be able to be used for the Cricket service. This change happens in just a matter of days. I saved up and bought this phone well before the change happened so I wouldn't be without a phone. I got the phone in the mail, and it didn't work. I called Ebay right away explaining to them my situation and how I needed my money back. They said I had to wait 5 days and if I don't hear from the merchant, they will refund my money to my paypal account and tell me what I need to do as far as sending it back. I wasn't fond of having to wait. I figured I should be able to send this broken phone back right away since it didn't work, but I waited because I had to. So I call ebay back after the 5 days for my refund, they tell me I wont be getting a refund until the merchant has received the phone back. I explained to them the situation with the cell phone company being bought out and im on a huge time crunch now because I was sent a damaged phone. They didn't care at all. They still refuse to refund my money until I go to kinkos, print out the label they sent me, return the phone and then wait for it to reach the merchant. I will NOT have my money refunded back to me before Cricket makes the change to only GSM capable phones. This means im not only out hundreds of dollars (not only for the phone itself but the accessories for the phone as well as the cost to turn the phone on and the first months payment, as I switched to a new carrier, and none or this is refundable). Ebay and Paypal together have seriously screwed me. Neither of them will refund my money in time to buy a new phone.

829,"On 20 January 2015, I purchased a Macbook Pro laptop on eBay for $791. The seller listed it in working order and having been inspected by Apple. The seller had excellent feedback, excellent communication, and it arrived promptly on 23 January. Just over a week later, the logic board failed, and the seller refused to accept a return, a partial refund for the estimated cost of repairs (an additional $425), or provide documentation that it had been inspected by Apple. The repair shop where I had it inspected confirmed that the logic board was faulty, and that the failure was not caused by user error. I opened a case with eBay on 3 February stating that the item was not as described (since the seller had no proof that it had been inspected by Apple), and it had failed within the time frame of their 30-day Buyer Protection clause. Ebay closed the case on 5 February in favour of the seller stating that because I had owned it for a week before contacting the seller for a return, it had been altered and was no longer returnable. My purchase should be covered under eBay's 30-day protection, but they have instead sided with a seller who lied about the condition of the computer. I have spoken directly with the case manager at eBay, but she was not helpful. I have contacted the seller once again requesting a partial refund for cost of repairs or a full refund for a return. I have filed official complaints about eBay's customer service with the Better Business Bureau and IC3; but I am still out $791 for a computer shaped brick, and an additional $425 if I want it repaired. I cannot contest the charge through PayPal, because the case has been closed, and I cannot contest the charge with my bank, because the seller refuses to authorise a return for the computer. The customer service team is unhelpful, rude, and hung up on me twice after I respectfully requested to appeal the case. I have been an eBay customer since 2006, and I have had excellent dealings with eBay up until now.

He does not have any physical address he could be in NJ or China. He is running a big internet scam by selling to people broken and defective electronic equipments. DO NOT BUY FROM HIM AT ALL even he try to sell same item at a very cheap price. In February 03, 2014 I bought ""Full HD LED-86 1080P Projector 2800 Lumens Contrast 2000:1 Support 16:9 freely"" from ebay - item# 400503212275 the price for this projector was $279.90. I paid trough Paypal $279.90 i paid for it at 13:53:54. I used my debit card at PAYPAL tracking number is 1ZRW54494397091711 to pay for it. The reason i decide to report that seller it is because the seller quotes """"1 year warranty from date of purchase record."""" In the past several weeks i was trying to chat with the seller in a way that i get my broken projector fixed he/she was ignored me each time he wrote me he asked to go to a local shop for repair which i did and I repeated myself so many times by telling him no local shop had that cable. All the techs kept telling me this should go back to the manufacture or where it was purchased and i asked him can i have a physical address to send it back. Since June 14th 2014 i kept asking the seller for a replacement or my money back he just answered quoted ""Sorry Which cable it is?"" After that i called EBay and paypal they told me if the seller did not do anything after 3 days you should file an online complaint. Paypal and Ebay called the seller about the one year warranty promise. Also, they referred me to this website in order to file this complaint. At this time, Ebay and Paypal cannot do that much cause their policies are only covered an item in bet 45-90 days from the day of purchasing it. The main reason that i want report this seller he claimed that his item has covered for a period of 12 months and last time he wrote to me that after 60 days he cannot do anything for me. Now, I became a victim of the internet scam and i need my replacement and my money back from the seller. Please help me to get either the replacement or my full refund. You can also try this number as +86 13545133038. I did not stop to tell him that i am a teacher and i use this projector to teach he does seem to be cared at all.

952,"Good morning good people. I have a warning for you. Please read. If you use ebay your are going to get screwed. I have lost my item and my money FOR THE LAST TIME and the bad part about it is that the buyers are using ebay to strong arm money and items from YOU THE seller. This is becoming more and more frequent. After talking to ebay it is quite clear that they side with the buyer and not the seller however. They feel that the buyer is the one who is responcable for paying the fees even thou it come out of the sellers account and it is a percentage of the sellers money that pays for final selling fees that are not calculated in to the price of the item. Im sorry for the rant, but Ebay feels they are way too big and can do what they wish and there is nothing we can do about it.  I sold an item, I fully disclosed that the item had broke at one point and time and I had it repaired however the item no longer was the opposing side from its mate they were now the same side. I decided just to get rid of the item because I didnt want to deal with having it repaired again so I listed the item on ebay with full description. I also listed the item for 30% less that it would have gone for being fixed in order to give the buyer the financial availability to have the item fixed and still get a good deal. After the sale I shipped out the item right away I heard nothing from the buyer. After a month the buyer contacted me and told me that the item was miss represented and was the same side. I copied and pasted the description so that he could read it again and he claimed that it was trickery and started saying that I was scamming him. He opened a Ebay dispute. And I returned his money for the item.  Once a buyer opens a dispute with ebay they yank the funds from your account. Because ebay owns paypal. Talk about a conflict of interest. This means if you are playing in ebays play ground if you dont do what ebay wants remember they are the prosecutor , judge and the jury aka (school yard bully). Here lies the problem. Once a case is open ebay always sides with the seller. My case was opened and the buyer still didnt want to read the description. So, in order to save time. Issued the refund because once ebay is involved they freeze your account. With my work schedule I cant run and check the computer every day much less deal with a illiterate person. However I have to put my faith in ebay because I am at their mercy at this point.  Now that the funds were refunded to the buyer ebay was satisfied and closed the case with out demanding that the buyer return the item. Needleless to say the buyer does not have to return the item. Ebay does nothing to enforce that you get your product back. However they will ruin you if you dont give a refund. I called ebay this morning and was less than satisfied with their responses. They basically told me to pound sand. They made it quite clear that if the buyer does not want to ship the item back then they dont have to. There is nothing they can do in order to make the buyer comply so in short Ebay took the sellers ability to leave bad feed back to the buyer so that the seller can warn other sellers about bad buyers and buyers who run scams such as this. This is called strong arming and with ebay owning both pay pal and ebay they have full control. Because of this bad business practice and dysfunctional policies I am deleting my ebay account that I have had for 15 years. I can no longer afford to give refunds and my product away.. This would be like buying a new tv from walmart then going back the next day and getting a refund but in Wal-Marts case they have the right and the ability to say not until the item is returned, this is where ebay bullies the seller because they take away your right to do this. However ebay does not enforce the buyer to return the item so this is more like a bully at a school yard.

I tell them I want to cancel my account and they tell me it takes 160 days for a cancellation to go through! WTF you mean to tell me you dumba$$ people will have my bank account information for the next 5 months??! Do not sell anything on Ebay. I have never bought anything so I can't say if it's bad about that but i can tell you i wont ever sell with them again..",1,ebay.com

Picture and title manipulation..picture has nothing to do with item, misleading titles.Fraud reporting in EBAY is deliberately made confusing and awkward in order to deter people from complaining...even if you complain, you will find that item is still posted the same fraudlent way and no action taken at all....EBAY is making huge profit being an effective scam accomplice.

When it came in the mail, it was fake... no proof of authenticity, cheap. I contacted the merchant, they asked me to return it for a full refund. I mailed it back with proof of receipt. They received it, never issued me a refund. Then I went to eBay - followed their Buyer's Protection process which required me to file a police report in the city where the merchant was from. Did that. Called eBay on a daily basis and never heard back from them. That was the last time I did business with eBay.

957,"ENCOURAGES FRAUD CHARGES FOR DEFECTIVE SERVICE VIOLATES CONSUMER RIGHTS AND THEN EXTORTS THE CONSUMER'S FAMILY FOR NOT PAYING! That is because they have the absolute WORST policies, complete lack of leadership, bad attitudes throughout the corporate hierarchy, do not properly train their staff, and in general show contempt for the consumer. If you look around online, you will see this sentiment is echoed by their own employees, including those who still work there. Even their current staff disapproves of how the company is being run. Ebay aids and abets fraud through its policies. They violate consumer law by charging for defective service or service not received. When it comes to buyer protection, they lack the resources and their staff lacks the proper training to effectively research and pass judgment on a claim. There is a complete lack of rational thinking and respect for the consumer, and no understanding of consumer law. All of their decisions in claims are based on inflating their bottom line, in reckless disregard for the consumer's rights or rights of the property holder. I have lost hundreds of $ to ebay and their bungling. They have apologized to me more than once, but it just doesn't make up for the damage they have inflicted and continue to fail to address. And every time I have it out with them, I get another apology, another confirmation that I owe them nothing and that I have losses, immediately followed by a demand for $ I do not owe them. If my account balance is zero, what are they billing me for? Every decision they make on any claim has more to do with limiting their own loss and risk, increasing their bottom line, and nothing at all to do with consumer protection or the correct, legal, or fair thing to do. They say one thing and then do the complete opposite. Ebay tried to debit my bank for refund money in a bogus claim- money that had never been paid to me, from a buyer that had already been given an Unpaid-Item-Strike for non-payment. I was forced to change my bank account information to prevent ebay from debiting me and to sever my contacts with them.  I had to give up an ebay store where I had been successfully vending with a great reputation, which took me over a decade to build up. I was deprived of my client lists and my e-mail marketing lists and prevented from contacting my audience. I lost property as a result of ebay's errors, and I had no choice but to flea the website, fearing for the further loss of property and money, and they have the nerve to try to bill me for 2 months worth of store subscription fees that occurred AFTER they aided a con-artist and abetted fraud, during which time they left me waiting for follow-up resolution action they promised me in the first 72 hours and never provided for 2 1/2 months.  And all I get now is a promise from ebay that they will not try to debit me for that refund amount again, a worthless apology, and a request to pay them for 2 months of service that I do not want, service they themselves put on my account only because they did not follow up on the case in the first 72 hours as they guaranteed me they would, and for which their own reps have told me I do not owe. Why do I have to pay for the 2 1/2 months worth of time that they NEGLECTED me, on a fraudulent claim they never should have allowed in the first place?  I canceled and voided my contract with ebay on the basis of defective service, in accordance with my consumer rights. I would say that if a website allows another user to scam you for money they are not due, then tells you they will fix it in ""not longer than 72 hours"" and then does not act for 2 1/2 months, leaving you wide open to further fraud, that seems like pretty defective service to me. For ebay to then bill me for subscription fees during this time is an egregious violation of consumer trust. I have spoken to their reps so many times, and they just do not have the mental capability to understand that any person would be unable to effectively transact anything on their website during that 2 1/2 months. How can you trust any of the transactions if any buyer can simply take money out of your bank without having paid it in the first place, and that will be not only allowed by ebay, but they will actually provide the means and method by which to steal from the seller? I am not talking about risk of loss or non-delivery here, but rather the original payment- as in, the buyer never paid, and ebay forced me to pay them instead. That is ebay-supported FRAUD. I was on the phone with their resolutions department for over 2 hours, while they profusely apologized and explained to me that they simply never realized that anyone would use their new dispute resolution to steal money from sellers. Really? How can you put a dispute resolution system in place and be so stupid as to not foresee it being misused in that fashion? It flies in the face of reason. The mere fact that they allowed this gaping hole in their software and policies in the first place is alarming and should warrant some legal intervention. At the end of that phone call, and after all the apologies, they invited me to open a new account and start fresh at a later date. So after my anger and dismay dissipated over the course of a year I did. I figured I would give them another chance, and see if they had fixed the enormous holes in the system. Well they shut my second account down, telling me I had ""policy violations"" on the first account! WHAT policy violations? because i don't want to pay a scam artist money I don't owe? because I exercised my right to void the contract and close the account when they engaged in shoddy, defective service that caused me to get ROBBED?  I have asked numerous account reps to confirm that my old, original account had a zero balance, and they told me yes it did, and nothing was owed, but then they tell me I have policy violations and an unpaid bill. They invited me to come back and use their site again and then shut me down for doing so. Then I got collections notices from them over this, and after showing the collections company all the info, they refused to collect it for ebay, because it was a bogus bill, and I don't owe them anything. They are just harassing me for sticking up for myself and for exposing the poorly designed system they put in place. To add insult to injury, I ended up on the other end of an INR claim with ebay, when buying on my second account that they invited me to open and then closed when I complained, I had to file not one but TWO chargebacks for items I never received. At least I actually PAID the sellers before filing INR, and ebay was going to refuse to give my money back when I received nothing at all. So much for their new ""buyer protection"". It only protects them, ebay. NO one else. Ebay made a mistake and misread the tracking info, declined me for a refund even though I never got the products, even on appeal, they simply could not examine a simple tracking system and see those items had been delivered to the wrong place. I did pay the bill and never got my purchases, so I had my bank reverse the transactions and override ebay's decision and get my money back. Every time ebay missteps and steals from me, I have to rely on my bank to shield me and protect me from ebay's bungling and stupidity. This is because their staff is poorly trained, cannot learn to read tracking information, or they just plain don't bother to look at claims at all and make rulings based on their own corporate profit margins. If they feel they can sacrifice you more easily than the other party, then that is how they rule the decision, even when no money has been exchanged! They do not care one iota for the consumer. They only care about money. IF the buyer is making them a higher profit margin, they rule in his favor. I guess I just wasn't making enough money for ebay, so they have a standing policy of throwing me under the bus. Can you see what is happening here? I've got 3 cases in the space of about 2-3 years- one case where I was ordered by ebay to repay money that was never paid to me. THAT IS FRAUD. SUPPORTED BY EBAY.  And then 2 cases where I was guaranteed protection against non-delivery, where I DID pay the sellers, and was refused a refund by ebay, despite bogus and faulty tracking. And in all 3 of those cases, ebay has been proven WRONG and responsible for my losses. BUT WAIT! IT GETS WORSE!!! After all of this, my mom wanted to sell some things on ebay to make some extra $, and despite my warnings against it I could not convince her otherwise. ""Forget it and move on"" was the attitude, because we figured what were the odds of this happening again? and we've got the bank on speed-dial now in case of any claim being filed against her or me on ebay, we simply call our bank and change our bank account info before ebay even responds to a dispute, as a preventative measure, as we know that ebay has a history of doing the wrong thing and siding with the wrong party.  So I helped her out by giving my mother some of my things to sell on her own ebay site, which was registered solely in her name, at her address, in a different state, with completely separate registration information, separate banking info, and account history going back years.  There was no connection between the 2 accounts other than the fact that we are related, and I gifted my mom my old childhood toys (which were already stored at her own home, shipped from her home, some of which she herself paid for 25 years prior when I was a child!) for her to sell and make some $.  And ebay had the nerve to shut down my mother's account and instructed her to take action on my old account and to pay my ""bill"". The same bill that I DO NOT OWE them, that their own account reps recognize as a giant BLUNDER, because they have no right charging me, and I canceled my contract with them.  I have even called them to argue about this and settle it, and have been told by more than one customer service rep that my account balance is zero and I owe nothing, and that ""someone failed to finalize the release of your account"". Then they put me on hold to go do this, come back on the phone, and ask me for $200 again! And then they shut down my mom's account and literally instructed her to ""take action"" on my account, which is ILLEGAL. That is EXTORTION. I do not have any legal rights towards my mother's account, and she does not have any legal rights toward mine. I'm an adult. I'm in my thirties! My parents are not legally bound to pay for my billing disputes. Yet here is ebay refusing my mother service on her account which is in good standing and telling her that she can't get service until she pays a bill in someone else's name for the sole reason that we are related. Is ebay a loan shark now? Is that the behavior we can expect from ebay in the future? That is what the mafia does. Is ebay the Mafia? because they sure do act like it.  She doesn't even know my password and had no way to get into the old account. And it is nearly impossible to get any help from customer service. It is just non-existent. We've got customer service telling us to respond by e-mail and e-mails that say we can only call to get a resolution. When the original fraud occurred on my original account, I was left on hold with ebay for over 40 minutes just to be disconnected without ever speaking to an account rep. It took them 2 1/2 months to call me back. 2 years later, and when my mother calls to fix her illegally restricted account, she is referred back to her e-mail, which refers her to call which refers back to e-mail....  Bottom line: EBAY SCREWED UP and they are shoving my entire family under the rug for it. We asked the state's attorney's general's office in our home state of NJ, and they were mortified that ebay would demand that my mom take action on an account that does not belong to her, for $ that is not owed (by ebay's own admission), and all because ebay goofed and allowed a fraudulent INR claim to be processed over 2 years prior.  This is the kind of vindictive, unlawful behavior that ebay has become synonymous with. This is why on chat forums the world over it has achieved the nickname ""evil-bay"". This company needs to be gutted from the top down, and it's corporate leadership entirely replaced with people who have a soul, an IQ, and a conscience. I have gone as far as to lodge complaints with BBB and the states' attorneys general, and I got a reply from ebay's office of the president that complained about my ""attitude"". HA! MY attitude? are they kidding?! In light of what has happened, I don't think my own attitude is the one at issue here. And just imagine telling any other customer anywhere in a retail situation their mother should pay their bill because of their attitude. They are just begging for a lawsuit. Please excuse me if this reads as a rant, but that is what ebay deserves: A RANT that exposes the corruption and utter lack of ethics that have become the core character of what was once a simple classifieds list. How far they have sunk! If I could give them a negative star, I would F-- and please picture me spitting on the floor in disgust.",1,ebay.com
958,"There are two perspectives that one can rate this site from: the buyer's viewpoint, or the sellers. As a buyer, I would have no complaints. But today I am rating this as a seller, because this is what I have been using eBay most for.  I have learned through experience that eBay has very little protection for sellers. A seller cannot leave negative feedback for a bad buyer, for one. He or she can only file an unpaid item claim. This process locks up the item for at least 8 days before it can be relisted. And there's the expense; eBay is costly, though I guess that's what you pay for brand recognition.  However, these all are just minor frustrations compared to my major complaint; eBay protects unreasonable buyers at the seller's expense. To elaborate, a buyer can open a Buyer Protection case if they want a refund due to some perceived error on the part of the seller, such as an improperly described item. If resolution can not be made via email between buyer and seller, eBay makes a decision on the case as to who is at fault. If in favor of the buyer, refund is forced. But if in favor of the seller, eBay removes the Buyer Protection case from the seller's record so it doesn't negatively affect his or her seller rating, and the seller is not required to issue a refund. That's the process. However, even if a seller wins a protection case, this does not block the buyer from leaving negative feedback, and what appears prominently for all to see is the feedback rating, not the seller rating.  Negative feedback stings. Whether a seller wins or loses a protection case, they still lose, because they are pretty much guaranteed a negative feedback either way. This creates an environment where the seller must try to bend over backwards for even the most unreasonable, or even fraudulent, customer in order to try to avoid negative feedback, and still has no protection if that buyer leaves undeserved negative feedback. And no, eBay does not allow that feedback to be removed, even if you have proof that you were in the right or have won a case in your favor; their customer service has said as much to me.  So to conclude, I have lost my trust in eBay to protect me as a seller. Their ""seller protection"" is worthless to protect what really matters; my feedback rating. Unreasonable buyers and scammers are a reality for sellers; it's only a matter of time. As such, I will not be selling on eBay anymore.",1,ebay.com

965,"Bought a student edition college text book for our son through this web site. Seller sent a ""examination"" copy. This is a free copy given to professors to see if they want to use the text book in their classroom. It is different from a student edition. Needless to say, when I went to sell the book back I was unable to get any money for the book because of the type of edition that it was. No where in the listing did the seller mention that it was the examination copy. He has had the same reports of misrepresentation throughout his history with half.com.

966,"I've been using ebay since 2001 and while being a buyer is great, especially when you're looking to score something cool for a cheap price. Unless you're looking for a really hard to find item, say something from your childhood. Then I would recommend sites like Amazon, GoHastings, etc. instead. As a seller on the other hand, let's just say that I have a few horror story's that I could tell you. One instance, while I was studying Graphic Design I opened up an ebay store and sold custom made t-shirts and hoodys. The primary color was Black, but I gave customers the option to pick from various colors. Well one day I had an order for one of my hoody's. So I made it. Packaged it. Mailed it and informed the customer it was on it's way and thanked them ever so much for their business. Only to get a very nasty and rude email a few days later saying they did not receive what they ordered. Apparently when they placed their order they requested the hoody in White. Yet when I brought up the invoice and even showed it to them, there was no mention anywhere that they wanted it in White and not the primary Black. After making numerous attempts to satisfy the customer. They were rude, insulted me, and filed a dispute against me over the whole ordeal. When I offered to replace them item with the White hoody, when all they had to do was send the ""wrong"" hoody back. Which they down right refused to do. Ebay and Paypal then shut down my store, and gave the customer a refund without even investigating(which they're supposed to do/even says so in their damn policy). I then presented Ebay and PayPal proof of the invoice from the customers order, that it in fact did not state anything about a ""white hoody"" they did nothing! It wasn't until I threatened them with legal action that they retracted the dispute, found in my favor and allowed me to once again do business. And that was just one instance. Many times I have had paypal with hold funds from me, because someone said they didn't get what they paid for. Only to have me fight with them(Paypal and Ebay), showing proof time and time again. Then they refund me the money they illegally with held, and find in my favor. Ebay is a rip off. They charge you 3x to use their services. They charge you to sell stuff(list items), they charge you when you sell an item, and since they own Paypal they charge you a third time to use that service. It's a monopoly and they will violate their own Terms & Service Agreement that you are sworn to uphold time and time again. If I had the money I would put Ebay out of business with competition.

I know from our experience over the years that you have to be wary of any bidder who has only 1 or 2 feedbacks because they are not likely to be educated enough to know what the DSR or Negative feedback could mean to the seller.

Nothing major, just a few things here and there that I could get a few bucks for and free up some room in my garage or basement. I'm really not a huge fan of eBay these days because it seems there is less and less room for small scale guys like me. I'm not a power-seller and I don't want to be. I just want to unload a few things I don't need instead of throwing them away. Anyway, most of my transactions have been pretty smooth. I sold a large lot of old VHS tapes and a couple smaller lots of books, and a few other random items. The last item I auctioned off was a Linksys wireless router. I had picked it up on Amazon for $48 when I first bought my laptop so I could be free to roam the house and not be chained down to the desk. I used it for about six months and everything worked perfectly. Then I switched internet providers and I no longer needed the router because FIOS gave me one to use for free. So rather than have an unused router sitting around collecting dust I figured I'd just pack it up back in the box and sell it. After all it was barely used and looked as good as new. I had the original box and everything else that came with it. I auctioned it off on eBay but all I got was a lousy $14. The seller sent me $22 (eight bucks for shipping) but after mailing it off and paying paypal and ebay fees all that was left was about $12. ""Oh well,"" I thought. ""I wasn't using it anyway and $12 is better than nothing."" After a few days I received an email from the seller complaining that I ripped her off and sold her a router that didn't work. I wouldn't say she was nasty about it but there was certainly the implication that I knowingly sold her damaged goods. I responded as nicely as possible that the router was working perfectly when I boxed it up and mailed it and is she sure she's using it right? I suggested reseting the router back to default settings as that might clear up any problems. She then wrote back that she tried everything and it doesn't work and she wants a refund.

I am a great seller with over 1100 feedbacks most from this year and last year. I was a powerseller and a top rated seller. I worked hard to take care of my reputation and business. All it takes is less than one handful of people to lie or steal from you and you loose your power seller and top ratings. Lakelandgifts is my ID check it out feedback has been great, but if you as a buyer leave less than 5 stars than Ebay dings the seller and eventually limits the number of items you can sell. I have over 1100 satisfied customers, this doesn't matter its the tiny few people Ebay listens too. The majority getting thrown under the bus for the small minority. Ebay limited me on the number of items I can sell to only 70 per month. All because of a few and I mean few like 7 people in a one year total that left me less than 5 star ratings. I have called Ebay 3 times and NEVER have they satisfied me with this problem or any other problem. Even an outright lie from a buyer and proven as a lie did not matter. Ebay is NEVER for a seller. As a buyer you get all kinds of help etc. Without sellers there are no buyers. As more and more great sellers experience the new system changes which began in April 2011 and all the fee increases, you as a seller will see their bottom lines disappear. I have never in my life experienced a more greedy company than Ebay. They need to go back to their grass roots and remember where they came from. I am looking to sell somewhere else and its sad that many of my great customers are suffering because of Ebay's limits and changes. It not only hurts you the seller but eventually you the buyer in the long run.

986,"eBay metal building scam - Christbilt aka Charles LaBoone has been running a scam that has taken the deposit of over a dozen people that we have located so far. 4 currently pressing suit in the amount of $31,500.00.  Sometime ago he did sell metal buildings but when Mueller would not sell to him any more per their Legal Dept. the scam began. He found all of us from his eBay listings. But did not have us purchase thru them, that way you can't post the truth on eBay and ruin the scam.  He goes thru the motions with contract, etc. seeming professional till he has your check in hand. Than the psycho behavior begins. Rants, name calling, whatever he can do to get under your skin to cause you to cancel your contract. He will either not give you a delivery date or will tell you New Years Eve 6 - 8pm. If he can't get you to cancel your order, he will cancel it. Than he informs you that you have given him so much grief that he is retaining your payment to him. It's that simple, than it's your job to try to get it back from him. Google Christbilt and you will see a sampling of the complaints against him, and people you can contact if you have been taken by this man. The other victims can assist you.

989,"There have been good purchases made from sellers from China and there have been bad purchases. What a lot of them do is have friends to increase betting but eBay never does anything to the seller if you report them. I've also won bids and they don't send out the item or they do they claim it was ""lost."" That's not true. You can tell they didn't like that I won the item on a low bid since they went and put the backpack back up. Again, eBay doesn't do anything. I also don't like millions of resellers in the world as of late. These are usually US sellers that are resellers. A lot of things they get in clearance at Michael's and Hobby Lobby they sell at full price plus shipping. I never buy from a US seller unless it's a book I really need and it ends up being cheaper through eBay. My warning is: shop around first even if the item is from China as I've seen them sell paper clips that seem cheap but they sell it individually whereas Hobby Lobby will sell it for cheaper but with a whole bunch of paper clips. That's just an example as I've seen it. It's cheaper to also get books at the thrift store than through EBay sometimes also. Like I said they if I really need or want the book I get it through EBay. Another warning is that I've seen things from the Dollar Tree and they are selling them at $7.95. That's insane! I cannot stress it enough; shop around first. Sometimes when it seems like a good deal; it's probably not. Especially with US sellers.",2,ebay.com

The catch? He wasn't willing to return the frames but wanted some sort of 'financial restitution.' ""Really?!""  At this point I am NOT willing to continue to put up with what seems to be a small, but growing contingency of individuals that have one thing on their agenda-- Scams/Scamming individuals!

994,"I've been a member since: Oct 08, 2003, and have a (243) 100% positive feedback rating. However, I'm finding that buying on Ebay is becoming more and more of an unpleasant experience due to the increasing fraud. In one instance, I spoke to TWO Ebay CSR's (called in twice) BEFORE I made a ""buy it now"" purchase, to have a seller/listing investigated because something didn't seem right. The price for the item listed was way too low.  The CRS's assured me that it was safe to go ahead and make the purchase despite the sellers reviews. Naturally, I never received my order. The tracking # provided by the seller showed that it was apparently ""delivered"" to a totally different province! Many other buyers were complaining about the exact same thing. Ebay does nothing towards providing the buyer a good will gesture for all your frustration and inconvenience. As far as I'm concerned, they're going downhill fast.",2,ebay.com

So many of these vendors sell shoddy merchandise and know you'll have problems returning items so you never get reimbursed for the return shipping.

997,I've sold plenty on eBay. And I have a 100% rating. My beef is that now you have to offer at least 30 days for refunds verses 14 days they use to offer.

998,"To be frank there is a lot of greatness in buying and maybe selling on ebay, but some things are just not ok. I had a seller take advantage of me by selectively marketing his product as one thing when it was another. When I complained he literally threatened me and wrote a very immature and profanity filled message to me.. to which eBay did nothing! Another time I started selling things and they have hidden fees, they could easily and clearly detail. After I sold the items, I got a bill for over $100 for several extra things I was not aware. It's too easy for them to show you an added expense in the process for anyone to be surprised, but they don't. So don't be surprised when you get billed after the fact.",2,ebay.com
999,"There was a time when eBay was king but those days seem long behind us. eBay has gone from a competitive business to just a business with their own interests placed well ahead of the customers! Sure, they talk a good game and appear ""customer service"" oriented, but they are far from it! With all of the things eBay does to secure new buyers and sellers, like eBay bucks and guarantee buyer protection, the experience continues to get worse and worse. One should also ask why eBay felt the need to implement these features...Is it because eBay saw the need to protect buyers and guarantee their purchases when those purchases went sideways? Well, I am a huge purchaser on eBay, but not a seller because I sell privately. I am glad I sell privately because I think my headaches would be doubled if I did twice the business on eBay. The biggest problem I have is that eBay allows sellers who have consistently bad reviews to continue doing business. There seems to be no process, no matter what they say, that punishes sellers who are unscrupulous and clearly scam buyers. I had a seller scam me out of a $85.00 purchase, leave a ""false positive review"" (meaning that the he used the positive feed back medium in order to leave me a bad comment) and he cussed me out via email, which eBay read and this guy is still selling! I also made a recent purchase from a guy who had 1,759 negative feedback remarks. How is a seller who is screwing people over that badly, and that clearly, still being allowed to conduct business on ebay? Why leave any feedback if it does nothing punitively to the seller? Sure feedback helps as a warning to buyers, but sometimes I move to quickly and I don't check seller feedback until it's too late. Scammers have also figured out ways to get your money and keep it and eBay can do little or nothing to prevent this either. Buyer protection is set up so that you have to wait to have eBay pay you back too! What I think needs to happen is this.....First, buyers should be allowed to block any sellers who they believe are conducting shady business or have actually conducted shady business. Seller ratings should be posted right next to their name REALLY BIG AND PROMINENTLY, and on the item they are selling also, so you know what you are getting immediately. This way, if I am moving to quick through a transaction, it won't matter because the seller selling practices will be broken down clearly and obviously so I cannot miss it! Presentation is huge and if an item is being presented in a manner where it says ""Pioneer Turntable being offered by GRADE D seller"" I guarantee that seller would do everything that they could to change that D to an A! I purchased an item from a seller who was really bad and because I rushed the transaction a few months later, purchased from the same guy! Bad experience feedback should give one the IMMEDIATE option to block that seller! If was given the option to block that seller I would have never gave him my business again, and worse, put myself at risk of a bad experience which I did have the second time too. The end result in changes like this will be that sellers will do everything in their power not to get blocked and to maintain a high rating next to their name. In NYC food places have ""A to D"" rating outside the business doors so you know what you're getting before you eat their food. If eBay did something similar then you will know what you're getting before you do business with every seller. My days doing business on eBay are surely numbered. It's only a matter of time before I don't visit the site at all. I will probably keep the account open, but I am sure that I will simply not buy from there anymore, or keep it open until I start getting annoying emails telling me that they ""miss me and want me to come back"" and that's when I will delete the account for good! I realize that I don't need them as much as I used to and the headaches, at least right now, far outweigh the benefits. Etsy has been my go-to site on my last 5 purchases and seems like the way to go for now. Ebay needs to get rid of gimmicks and do things that truly protect the buyers. Clarity and real punitive action is the first step. Full disclosure! Show the buyer, immediately who the seller is and how that seller does business! Believe me, do this and things will straighten themselves out in the end!",2,ebay.com

1001,"Using ebay is usually ok unless there is a problem. Twice I have sold stuff on ebay & the buyer has requested to return the item by making false statements. The problem is that ebay allows buyers to return anything & everything without any evidence, photos, etc & makes the seller pay for everything which is unfair! When postage is $10 for an item & the seller has to pay $10 to send it & then $10 for the return all of a sudden it costs the seller $20 if a buyer wants to return something..for any reason the buyer has with no pictures or evidence or anything..this can get expensive for sellers to ship goods all over the US without collecting any money. Customer service doesn't care at all about sellers return policy or requesting any evidence from buyers either...they want sellers to eat the costs of returns which is unfair when buyers break the return policy. A buyer with an address registered to about 50 companies including pawn shops & tax companies did this to me & it appears to be fraudulent or for money laundering purposes & I am not happy with how ebay requires no evidence of damage or something being not as described before allowing the buyer to return the item for a full refund at a $20 expense to the seller. Ebay fails sellers on a massive level. Ebay has a defacto policy that the 'buyer is always right' and free returns for all buyers EVEN IF SELLERS HAVE NO RETURNS in their contracts.",2,ebay.com

Then there are the behind the scenes infractions like shell bidding and scams. eBay does offer buyers the opportunity to buy vintage items but beware of the price you will pay! In my opinion, eBay is still the biggest and offers the most stuff, but high fees and frequent scams have kept me away. Sometimes, an open dispute(s) can last for several weeks. To me, eBay's open dispute process is a bit useless especially if there is more than one at a time.",2,ebay.com

If you are relisting the same item the item number should never change you stupid people at Ebay. Anything to steal our money. And say we get shipping discount post office price is $7.10 then ebay discount you pay $6.90 but ebay charges you final value fee of .71 figure it out there is no discount of 25%. Customer pays $7.10 you pay 6.90 plus .71 so you pay 7.61 explain where I am saving using ebay labels.

1013,I bought a camping headlight from boris-lighting the seller. I went to pay for item and it won't accept my payment because he doesn't ship to PO boxes. I sent two messages explaining this is the only way for me to get my mail unless he wanted to pay the extra shipping charges to send it to my house. No answer on that but he did say he would just send it to my post ffice without PO on it and it would be fine. I said no it won't be because they send packages not properly addressed back to sender. This guy then opened an unpaid complaint against me with EBay after not answering any of my questions or getting the shipping deal worked out. No where in his posting did he say he didn't don't send to PO Boxes had he said that I never would have bought from him. But this guy will not answer questions or try to work out problems. So I paid for my item just so Ebay can't say i didn't and boris-lighting will not be happy with the feedback I leave him. And as far as Ebay's complaint dept I tried to answer them as to why I hadn't paid yet and got nothing but run around in circles trying to find a place to type a message to them. Ami pissed off damn straight I am because I should be able to say why I haven't paid.

He said not possible, he would have to send a HDD with OS. I agreed. After 4 weeks, it still hadn't arrived. I left negative feedback explaining the computer was defective and I ended up buying a HDD from another seller and OS. Of course it was negative. And ebay deleted it.I was not aware that ebay had a policy where they could delete feedback, other than profanity etc. of which there was none. No explanation as to why they deleted it, and I asked..

1019,"I placed an offer for a 2007 GMC on eBay. It was promptly declined and followed up with a personal phone call from sales person Jehanzeb Joe Yameen (the used car dealer named Amazing Cars and also Ultiamte Motorsports). Joe indicated that the car was sold (which it wasn't) and then directed me to a 2004 Suburban Z71 that they had in stock. He did not want to do the transaction through eBay/Paypal so they could save commission expenses.  At the time I relied on their positive eBay reviews, which I now see are incomplete and a false representation of their business. (see additional reviews on BBB, ripoffreport, YP and an enormous amount of negative reviews that are not recommended on Yelp). Jehanzeb Joe Yameen, Umer Omar Haseeb, Farhan Frank Sultan, Sami Hasan, Haq Samira, Cheryl Haseeb, Faisal Ashraf, Mike Hasazada etc operate under several business names including Affordable Sports & Imports, Amazing Cars LLC, Ultimate Automobiles, Ultimate Automobiles of Houston, PSL Autos, Car Champs, Shaz Auto Enterprise and several more. Have fun reading through all of those negative reviews. They also operate out of two addresses, 10311 Altonbury Ln and 12227 Murphy Rd. I purchased the suburban and it was supposed to be delivered in 5-8 days. It took them THREE weeks to deliver it and so I had it delivered directly to a local car mechanic. The mechanic called me immediately and told me all the monitors/codes/check engine lights had been intentionally cleared and it is highly likely there is something wrong with the vehicle. As well, the spare tire and jack kit are not here. You can see where this is going. Fraud. Making a long story a little bit shorter - +$5000 later and I still have not even begun to do work on the failing transmission.

Buyers take advantage of the low prices on this stuff.. but then are unhappy with the length of time it takes to get their order.. and most times the merchandise is very low quality and not as advertised. It is impossible to return the merchandise as most people do not realize that returning something to China will cost much more than the item is worth.

1035,"Be very careful, because eBay sometimes deletes negative Feedback for sellers, and you may not see valid negative feedback posted by buyers who were burned by a seller. Some sellers use eBay to sell ruined products that nobody would ever buy in person. Sellers also use a ""No Returns"" policy to maximize their ability to unload ruined items, and since eBay's ""guarantee"" is specifically limited, buyers may get stuck with unusable items.  On several occasions I have purchased pieces of Waterford and Wedgwood, a cashmere scarf, Cutco and other kitchen items, etc., listed as new, perfect, and in excellent condition, only to receive items that had subtle but very significant problems. They were ruined, due to being scorched, marked, dirty, bent, scratched, shattered internally, had finish issues, or were deemed second quality by their manufacturers for various reasons. eBay listings state that eBay guarantees items when a seller does not offer returns, but a buyer may not prevail in a claim when something is abnormal, as eBay may deem it to be a ""color"" issue, and they call that buyer's remorse. When a buyer offers to pay the shipping costs both ways, and the seller refuses to agree to that and refund just the purchase price, you know it's a scam. That is a seller who is very happy to have unloaded some ruined junk.  If you do not prevail in a claim, do not file an appeal online, call eBay to file the appeal. If you file it online, it will be handled by the same type of front-line employee who denied your claim in the first place. Once an appeal is denied, then even if eBay leadership later says that the case should have been decided in your favor, the case cannot be reopened. eBay leadership will tell you to contact PayPal. Plus, if you do not prevail against such a seller, any negative feedback that you post will be deleted by eBay. In fact, if you even mention the word refund in your negative feedback against a seller who has a ""No Refunds"" policy, eBay will delete it. Some sellers are pretty good at using eBay's rules to burn buyers, one after another, while maintaining an undeservedly good feedback score.   Sellers who list items with quality issues sometimes use fuzzy photos to disguise the issues, while those same sellers use clear, enlargeable photos for their items that have no issues. Yet these differences in listing methods, which facilitate a seller's scams, do not raise red flags with eBay when there is a claim against such a seller. In addition, even if eBay refunds you for a problem item, the seller may try to draw you into an invalid claim against the US Postal Service, claiming that the abnormality was caused by something that happened in transit. If you can find the same item on Replacements Ltd., or Amazon, or another site with stronger guarantees, or in person, where you can see what you are buying, you may save yourself a headache by avoiding eBay, because some eBay sellers use the site to scam buyers.",2,ebay.com

1047,"I use to use Ebay for everything. It was my go-to place to shop. Now I rarely check there first anymore. In recent years I've noticed that it is getting harder to look for a seller that isn't in China. Even the profile on Ebay sellers product description will say ships from New York City and until the shipper sends you a tracking number after the product is bought, you notice a delivery company from China pops up and the city of origin is even a Chinese city. When they go through such deception to hide that fact people should be weary. If I want to buy from a Chinese vendor that's my choice. To deceive someone into thinking that you are purchasing from your home country and its not, that is a different animal all together. I suppose Ebay does not put more stringent rules on its vendors. I suppose that Ebay isn't concerned as long as the money keeps rolling in.   It has gotten so out of control that I would look through Amazon first, then small individual sites, then check Ebay as a final resort. As a buyer you have to scrutinize each product ad to make sure you are buying from where it says. Even so, you can get duped. Most of the time you can sort them out just by looking how they word their product desciption. They don't know the correct English sentence structure. Anyway, their service has spiraled downward.

1050,"I've been a customer of eBay since 2011 and never had problems. However, on 5 Feb 2016 I bought a motorcycle jet kit. When the estimated delivery date as per the seller was exceeded with no sign of the kit, I opened a dispute (13 April 2016) and the seller responded by sending another package with a new tracking number and I closed the dispute believing that this time I will receive what I paid for. Here I have to state that BOTH tracking numbers are completely useless. All it ever tells you is that the package is in transit. It never even arrives at customs in South Africa, let alone are delivered to me. (Tracking numbers: LJ890387596US and LJ899331546US) When the allegedly sent second package once again did not arrive, I tried to contact the seller who was extremely rude and unhelpful. I asked them to please contact the US Postal Service and find out where the packages are, since it was sent by them and they must surely know what happened to it since it didnt even make it to customs. But the seller disregarded this request completely and ignored me ever since. When I tried to open a dispute since I havent received the second package, eBay just informed me that since I closed the original dispute, I cannot open another dispute plus the time frame for the money back guarantee is exceeded. I have tried absolutely everything to get assistance to no avail. eBay is simply not interested in my problem of having paid for nothing. They keep hiding behind the fact that I closed the original dispute in good faith. My observation is that the money back guarantee is useless. All the sellers have to do is to drag out delivery, and make promises they dont keep and eBay penalises the BUYER for acting in good faith.",2,ebay.com

1052,"Buyer View: It's a great place to buy things for a cheaper price than what they'd normally be, but like some have already said, know who you are buying from. Don't go with someone who has a lot of negative reviews [most larger sellers will have some though], and carefully read the listing and know it inside and out, otherwise you could get ripped off. I myself almost got ripped off when purchasing a pair of Ray-Ban aviator sunglasses. The seller seemed fine and the listing explicitly stated that they were a genuine pair of Ray-Ban, because of how often Ray-Bans are counterfeited, I took a screenshot and video of the listing in case any issues arose. The best decision I did. After a few fishy things happening, I received the sunglasses and saw immediately that they were fakes. Luckily, eBay gave me no trouble and promptly gave me a refund. The downside? Because eBay removed the listing I was unable to give the seller the negative review he deserved. Moral of the story? If you are going to eBay to find something for less that is a very popular item, Ray-Ban sunglasses for one, know what a fake and genuine pair look like, read the listing very carefully, take screenshots of the listing right before you buy so you have proof, and investigate the seller. Also, don't go reading the positive reviews about a seller, read the negative ones, they're what really tell you the story. Even if a seller has a lot of positive reviews, see why they have any negative reviews in the first place, see, if they don't hide the item, if it's an item you're thinking of getting also. So yeah, it's a good place to buy things, but just keep in mind it's like any cheaper end shop where you can get a deal, shop carefully and read everything carefully. Also, take screenshots because they may come in handy, video if you really want to. Seller View: It's okay to be the seller, but sometimes it sucks $#*!, not going to lie. Why? Well, let's start with basics, you can't freaking give a buyer a negative review, even if the buyer was terrible to deal with, ONLY buyers can give negative reviews to seller. What a bunch of $#*!. -_- Like what the heck? Oh, and I don't wanna hear everybody's stuff about how that's totally fair, it's not. How is it fair that a seller can't warn other sellers about how $#*!ty some buyer may be, but if some buyer gets their pants in a bunch, for no reason, they can give a seller a negative review. So as a seller, it can REALLY suck from that angle. In terms of other aspects, I sold something, person said they never got it, even though I know they did, so the hell to all those people saying eBay is ONLY seller savvy, nope, not always. The buyer won.... Also, like all selling places, they'll take a chunk of your profits, yeah.... [not too much, but still] So it's a nice place to sell things, just know, if you have an issue with a seller be ready for many issues because eBay will almost always side with the buyer and the buyer has all the power to screw up your rating.... All in all, being a seller is okay.... So yes, being both a buyer and seller, it's an okay place to buy things for cheaper, usually.",2,ebay.com

1054,"What once was a fun and charming way to garage sale anywhere on the planet has become a red-flag version of low-end retail: 1) It's cheap, meant in the sense that it's evolved into the Jerry Springer of web sales and purchases. Cool finds are almost impossible anymore on eBay.   2) It's expensive. If you're a buyer, there is a very good chance you'll find the same item for LESS elsewhere. EBay is no longer a bargain. Ridiculously-inflated goods, scam-price shipping, and eBay ""fees"" are a joke. Shop around and see.  3) If you're a seller who's recently cleaned out Grandma's attic and have found a few treasures, eBay is no longer the place to cash in. Polls of legitimate sellers (the original tag sale-type sellers) have moved on, finding eBay isn't the place to offer goods, and replaced by sellers who have 'stores"" with some high-priced overseas junk. The format that charmed us all in the beginning has evolved into something much less appealing. Nothing sells on eBay the way it used to. Not only will you be left with the item you tried to sell (and relist over and over following eBay's dumb ""suggestions""), you'll also be left with charming fees.  4) US Selling/Purchasing: Looking for something but want to filter out overseas items? Don't bother. EBay is either just fine with overseas merchants scamming the system into being able to list, OR, they don't have the intelligence or technology to filter them out. Either way, if you're trying to find items sold in the US, you won't be able to filter out those who should not be listed.  5) Support. Seriously, there is none. Try to find a meaningful link for help. Like the proverbial rabbit hole, each link brings you to another link, and then another, and then, well by that time, you think the FAQs simply MUST have some help but it's all just general junk questions. If you're looking for a real person to online chat with or, heaven forbid, an actual phone number to call, just give up now and quit trying.  6) Bottom Line: That's all it is for eBay CEOs.

I hope my testify reach out to many so that no one would have the same bad experiences as I did. I have saved emails and the bad item that I received from the seller as evidences and Im willing to share them if needed. So heres my story On 12/3/2015, I ordered an item($53 worth) from ""superbeam20"" in Ebay. On 12/27/15, I received the item and only found out it was wrapped up in a cheap plastic bag, the item was horribly made, and it had many scratches on. This item was to never to leave their facility and belonged in a trash can instead. I was so disappointed that, for the first time in my Ebay life, I left a negative review on the seller for selling me a horrible product. And I also contacted the seller (superbeam20) to inform the issue and requested a replacement. They contacted me right away and they asked me to change my negative review to positive in exchange for a replacement. So I trusted them and I did so (Mistake #1). After some email exchanges, on 1/6/2016, finally the seller claimed that they sent the replacement, so I believed without asking for the tracking # (Mistake #2). I waited patiently for over a month, and on 2/10/16, since still no luck of receiving it, I contacted them about the status. They kept telling me all these excuses of Chinese New Year and talk to your post office bra bra and made me to wait a little bit longer, so I waited (Mistake #3). On 2/15/16, still no replacement so I contacted them and they gave me a tracking #. But it was not a working # nor was trackable. I finally lost my patient and told them I would wait for another week and if I dont receive it by then, I would have to ask for the refund. On 2/25/16, up on my request, the seller agreed that they would get me the refund within 24hrs so I believed (Mistake #4). After waiting for another 3 days without the refund, the seller only gave me lame excuses as usual. On 3/1/16, I contacted Ebay and Paypal to step in. Ebay told me that they can no longer help me out since 30-day term has passed and also I was told that I could not reverse my review on the seller since I already changed the review on them before. Sucks. On 3/2/16, Paypal was able to help out since they have a 6-months term. So Paypal stepped in and requested the refund for me. Then all the sudden, the seller was now requesting that I need to return the bad item in order to receive the refund. And I was also told that I have to pay for the return shipping. What??!!! On 3/3/16, I found out it was $88 to send it back to China with tracking # on it. Got screwed big time. :( I called Paypal one last time to explain the whole story and they felt sympathy over me and generously offered me a first timer break and got my full refund back from their own pocket. Thank God! And thank you Paypal! The Paypal guy also told me that I should do a little more researches before conducting any businesses with the sellers from China. I told the Paypal guy, After all the troubles I went through, you made my day today! Once again, Thank You Paypal! And SHAME ON YOU superbeam20! Hope this testify reach out to many for good.

1076,"Do NOT use eBay for your regular purchases! Most of them are not a good deal. Just drive that extra mile to go to a larger city so you can get the items instead. You will pay the same or even less if you just go to a physical store. And if you have car trouble, they sell car parts on ebay which is usually pretty good. I even found a replacement car hood really cheap including shipping. They probably sold it at a loss. I buy gift cards and reloadable cards on ebay. No problem there either. I have bought vitamins, including vitamins for my guinea pigs and they ship no problem. Buy anything in bulk and it will ship no problem. Buy a heavy item and it will ship no problem. Buy a rare item and it will ship no problem. Buy an expensive item and it will ship no problem. HOWEVER, you have to contact the seller and REQUEST that it be delivered directly to your door. I find that USPS rarely does this. On the contrary the USPS usually LOSE my packages! Apparently it is not the seller's fault as long as they mail it. Most Cheapskate and sometimes Ghetto sellers refuse to ship UPS, even if I agree to pay extra shipping. eBay used to specify which shipping carrier the seller uses, but now it just says ""Standard Shipping"", ""Expedited Shipping"" etc. with no mention of the carrier. It is up to the Seller whether or not to even put that information! All the items I mentioned will usually ship UPS or FedEx, delivered directly to your door without any problems. The rest of the items, DON'T EVEN BOTHER. And the auctions are rigged! Make sure you have signed up for a free UPS account (they will bill you for various services requested) and if they ship UPS Sure Post that means USPS so make sure you upgrade it to UPS Ground. I had bought some items on ebay and requested ""2 Day Air"" which used to be UPS but they decided to ship with UPS Sure Post. They took my shipping money and ran with it! And then I had to pay UPS directly to change it to UPS Ground. That's right. Instead of Air, I now have Ground! What a loss of money! Actually it doesn't cost that much but it is still kinda of a rip off. Just buy from some other website. There are many that are even better than ebay, and the other websites don't mess with you on the shipping. Use these websites instead.",2,ebay.com
1077,"I've been on eBay for a long time since the late 1990's. Starting off as a buyer and several years later as both a buyer and seller. Here are a few of my gripes: 1. Buying stuff from a seller at times leads to a great amount of aggravation. Many sellers are not sophisticated people; to be generous, I'd say some sellers are truly morons. You'll find sellers without any sense of applying good business practices. Because of the mental ineptitude or the basic criminal minds of some sellers, buying from Amazon might be a preferred purchasing method in order to avoid buying aggravations. Here's an example of a purchasing problem my wife recently experienced. She bid on a second-hand, small mirror priced at under $10 which had a shipping cost listed as $40; and she didn't observe the $40 shipping cost when she placed the bid. The actual cost to ship this small mirror probably would cost about $5 to $10 (maximum). In essence, the seller was attempting to ""pull a fast one"" on my wife. The seller admitted the shipping cost mistake but demanded my wife pay the $40 shipping cost, which the seller said would refund the difference between the $40 and the actual shipping cost. My wife refused to hand over the $40 for shipping costs because the seller refused to rebill her for the actual shipping cost. This turned into a lot of back-and-forth seller/buyer communications which the seller showed her true colors ... and a very ""dark"" color, indeed a crook. The obnoxious seller was ugly and created a lot of aggravation. Turns out the eBay seller was ""new"" without any negative feedback; a big surprise. I would highly recommend you first buy things from Amazon, if possible ... definitely more sophisticated sellers at Amazon for new product items. But when buying old stuff, that's where you have a good chance of buying crappy stuff on eBay. 2. Now a more recent problem with eBay is the complaint contact method with the company. Once you could use e-mail and have a written record of complaints filed. Now eBay does everything with phone contact. The problem with phone contacts is the lack of having a written record, but instead being guided by an eBay representative that doesn't know what they are doing. In fact, you may be guided outside the policy rules that eBay supposedly governs. 3. Another issue is that the bad sellers (the ""crook"" types) continue selling on eBay. EBay does settle quickly in your favor to refund the cost of a bad product. But ... you'll later see the same high volume, junk selling crook flooding the marketplace with crap. So you'll go through a miserable buying experience and so will others in the near future. By the way, I've noticed this situation to be true on Amazon, too. Have had the exact same negative experiences with both companies. 4. What's interesting is when I just happened to purchase the same item from both an Amazon and an eBay seller. I had purchased an item from Amazon that was not as advertised. I needed this item ASAP, so I happened to see the same item on eBay unknowingly it was from the same seller ... oh crap! So both purchases were from the same seller and both times shipped the wrong item. It was obviously the seller was dumping it's inventory. The fact the first time I confronted the seller on Amazon made no difference when I once again received the same, wrong item on eBay. Because this particular seller was a high volume mover on both Amazon and eBay, I made an interesting observation of the quantity of negative feedbacks left on Amazon and eBay. First of all, this seller didn't have a pristine selling history review on either Amazon and eBay. But I examined in depth the volume of negative feedbacks left on both Amazon and eBay. For a given time period, Amazon recorded a much larger number of negative feedback complaints than eBay ... about a four-to-one difference. So I have to ask, ""Why does eBay show much fewer negative feedbacks?"" 5. Another problem you can experience from a seller is their very poor packaging of an item. If you don't return a damaged item, then you're screwed. Items costing below $100 simply aren't worth my time to return, so I ""eat"" the item I purchased. I recently tossed (in late 2015) an old printer into the trashcan I received; virtually no packing material was used by the seller. Might as well have placed a shipping label directly to the printer, no box needed. The above reminds me of the time I purchased an inexpensive (Made in China) impact drill from Amazon. When I plugged it into the power outlet, it smoked. This piece-of-junk was transferred to the trashcan without hesitation. It's the time period we live in ... a lack of human consciousness reigns. 6. An early 2016 year purchase problem was an inaccurate description of an item. Pictures of the item did not show cosmetic flaws. It was described as ""cosmetically perfect."" The item has a plastic cover containing micro cracks and a chip which can't be cosmetically repaired. Well, this seller obviously had a high threshold of when he thought an item contained flaws. So when I received the item, I filed an eBay complaint. I told the seller to knock off $25 on the purchase price, otherwise send me a return shipping label. Seller accepted the $25 refund. Of recent, I'm running into more eBay purchase problems due to inept or dishonest sellers; buyers beware! I've had mostly good luck with eBay over the years considering the volume of stuff I've purchased (and sold). Have purchased up to four-figure items and sold many four-figure items and sold a few five-figure items. But all it takes is a few bad deals to make life a bit more miserable!",2,ebay.com

1079,"Ever hear of Ali-Expess.com? Well, it's China's e-bay or so like it, but BIGGER! Did you know that e-bay is just a pawn in the game of chess? Ever wonder how new items are so cheap and you can't afford to sell yours for a profit? China produces about 70% of all manufacturing that comes to us in the U.S. There is a conglomeracy of China products based in California that China sellers use from a HUGE warehouse so they can ship items on e-bay faster rather than from China, a new one but much smaller has opened up here in N.Y. After doing much research, I now use ebids.net to sell on and Ali-express.com to buy from, ordering direct and bargaining with the seller using e-bay as a tool. E-bay is just another middleman who has gotten too big for their britches, making money buying and selling products on their website. Amazon is a true leader in selling products and is U.S. not from China based. E-bay is just another website that does not care about you or me but still must not conform to regulations as they hold themselves not responsible as per their agreement policy. We can complain all we want and lose money to e-bay but, it is up to us to do our homework and look out for ourselves. Shop around people, make offers to sellers privately and sell on the 2nd biggest selling site to help e-bay monopoly. Wall-mart has the best prices if you settle for their brands and Ali-express if you can wait the extra time on shipping putting the big time sellers out of business. P.S. China will sell from their warehouses but will not let us use them in the United States. To buy quantity, use Alibaba.com and warehouse yourself if you have the room.

1080,"They take a fee to sell your book on their website, but I'm not sure what it goes to pay for as their customer service is horrible. I sent in an email to change my bank listing information where they would be sending payments. I got a sketchy phone call more than a few days later from someone claiming they were going to help me change my payment bank account info. This is sketchy at best as the woman did not indicate this was why she was calling. With all the scam artists calling to try to steal info out there they need to train people better on how to reassure people they are calling that who they are and why they are calling. Or maybe send an email indicating how we will know what to expect or to even expect a phone call to begin with. I explained my situation to the agent who did not understand what I was saying. She basically kept repeating herself as if reading from a book indicating how to respond to certain questions. Like talking to a poorly programmed robot. Asked to speak to a supervisor who understood what I was asking but was horribly rigid about the rules. When I explained that my old bank account still exists but is no longer in my name she explained there was nothing they could do and I should call the bank to have them transfer, except my new account is not w/ the same bank. They said the system is automated and there is nothing they can do. I asked to speak to her supervisor (we are 2 levels up now) and at least got someone how was willing to admit that something else could be done. Looked and claimed there wasn't anything he can do. As someone who used to work for major company's in customer service there is always something you can do in a system. Maybe it requires a certain supervisor passcode or a special work around in the system but there is always something. They said I should talk to the person who has the bank account, but given that I am paying them a fee to use their service I shouldn't have to. And not to mention not everyone would be able to do that. What if I was a previously abused woman and the account was under my abusive ex husband's name?

Another problem is that sellers are often ""Suspended"" without prior notice to the purchaser, leaving a purchaser without any recourse for a refund.

Ok fine so I did. Then they told me to take more pictures to make sure the numbers were right. Ok fine did that. Then they asked me if I bought from another seller which at this point its been a week/week and a half of this so I ordered a few red roses (50 red from one other seller and 12 red from another seller )because Im not going without flowers for my wedding.

Ebay's rules and philosophy that they can run the business better than the seller is causing good sellers to leave in droves. With their restrictions and high fees it is almost impossible to make a profit as a seller on Ebay anymore. They are kicking out all the small sellers with collectible and one of a kind items and promoting the large sellers specifically those from China with cheap imitation goods.  The buyers are having a hard time on Ebay as well as most of the older more experienced sellers are either moving on or diversifying and putting all their good items elsewhere. Ebay has become the yard sale place and the place of inferior quality cheap Chinese goods. Not only that but buyers have to contend with new sellers taking the place of the older experienced ones and they do not have the experience to run a great customer oriented business.

1094,"http://www.ebay.com/usr/odem_nowadays Received my second order from Odem_nowadays shop in Ebay and gave 2 positive, one neutral and one negative comment on the 4 items received. That was due to one item bent due to having been packed folded, not enough padding for the items, so the bag had torn, and slightly slow shipment. They kindly offered to refund the bent item, and I revised my rating for the item to positive. Otherwise the items were nice quality, just as promised, and the price was good. Never received my fist order of 5 items, that had already shipped prior to me placing the second order. After 30+ days' wait and then a month of many emails nothing was done by them to correct the issue, but they kept hinting that they could not help because I had not given fully positive review to them, and as a small company they need and deserve perfect reviews. I could not change the review afterwards to an unrelated order and cannot see the relevance. They seemed to suggest that maybe both orders had been shipped together, but the shipping notice for the first order was prior to placing the second order. Gave me a promise a few times to reship the order and twice to refund within 48 hours, but nothing happened as time passed by. Got refund from Paypal. They still bothered to send me a message to say that it is important not to leave any negative or neutral feedback/review for them for the order that I never received. Free shipping does not really benefit either the customer or seller. The estimated cost must be added to item price for the business to survive, but not specifying the shipping cost as a part of the total cost makes the customs fees and duties higher for the buyer. As a buyer I would be encouraged to make only small orders, below the dutiable value, which causes added work and cost for the seller.  Well, on the other hand I would not place any large order to a seller that I have not found reliable. And sad to say, this shop was not reliable.  Lots of nonsense and trouble. No option for tracking number for shipment. Ebay itself is a great concept. Customer service only reachable by phone, and resolutions only available via Paypal.

It looks like I have to earn the right to do business with eBay.  Well it appears eBay puts a limit on sellers until they ""prove themselves"". I am a person of honor and proved myself past I feel. So here I set with hundreds of items and no place to sell them, and have to look elsewhere. So I guess eBay does not need my commissions.  They lost my respect, and pretty much said my past performance means nothing to them.  I will find other means to sell my antiques and collections.  It is not as if their fees are cheap to begin with.",2,ebay.com
1100,"I've bought a couple of hundred products on eBay in the last decade, including 2 cars. My most recent car purchase was problematic and eBay totally blew me off as far as backing me up. I chose to ""make an offer"" instead of bidding on the car and followed that with a $500 deposit through PayPal. The dealer requested a certified check upon delivery of the car and that, according to eBay, made it ""an outside transaction"" and a disqualification from any eBay protection. What?? I couldn't even leave a review because eBay ""had no record"" of the listing, bidding, or offer ( Again.... What??) and it did not appear on my Purchases. So much for my faith in the eBay Guarantee.

As a buyer I then had a couple of experiences where I bought some items (usually the higher end stuff of course) that the seller would take forever to deliver. They were in fact stalling me till the time i could no longer lodge a dispute, I wised up to this pretty quickly, however, eBay just washed their hands as ""it was out of the alloted time to lodge a dispute"", yeah well no wonder you are making 10% on all purchases regardless of whether they get delivered or not.

We are top rated, have been for years, yet every year ebay insists on adding another hoop we must jump thru to keep that status. This year it's the detailed ratings. Last year it was tracking uploads. We lost our top rated seller status this month because we were closed (and so was our post office) for 2 days due to the ice storm that hit our southern state. Ebay said they would handle it, yet we lost our top rated by .01% (that was 2 tracking numbers). Did you know if a buyer returns a brick to you instead of a pair of shoes, you will have to refund them for the brick? Yep, that's what a rep told me last week. We all know the buyer wins, but why bother with the reporting abuse of return feature if it doesn't really matter?

Seller wouldn't respond or anything so I could relist. I had to wait until ebay said i could close the case. To top it off, eBay does not take action on the buyer and they don't allow sellers to provide negative feedback on buyers who don't pay. They should provide sellers with equal review ability and protections as buyers. I am sure that bad buyers lead to future bad sellers. Hopefully I will find a better auction site on sitejabber; I am no longer an eBay fan.",2,ebay.com
1110,"I used to buy & sell a lot of items on ebay, although I did more buying than selling. I rarely use the site anymore. The fees rose to the point where it was no longer practical for a ""small"" seller such as myself to sell on ebay because I was nearly giving the item away after ebay & paypal fees and shipping. I do not buy much any more from ebay because the vast majority of the items are ""Buy it Now"", which means in most cases it is not really an auction site; this took the fun out of it for me and made it more challenging to get a good deal. I rarely see a ""buy it now"" price that beats the price I can find elsewhere.",2,ebay.com
1111,"It would be difficult to recommend EBay to anyone. In the past year the site has become even more anti-seller than before (and I think they often don't support the good buyers who are not scammers but honestly trying to resolve issues). If a site is anti seller it is also anti buyer. EBay customer service is a joke...they're in some -istan nation and often do not speak English as a first or even second language. EBay employs all these people...overseas, for pennies. At the same time, EBay has become very inhospitable to small sellers by limiting views of their items so that even though sellers pay to list things, EBay's most recent user agreement states they ""may not"" show in searches! That has to be fraud! Not to mention Paypal, owned by EBay, which freezes people's funds not only in Paypal accounts but in bank accounts linked to Paypal, for 21 days and longer. That has to be against the law! In a stunning purge of small sellers last year, EBay with no notice at all closed the accounts of over 15,000 small sellers. This is outrageous. This is during a recession, when so many depend on the business they do on EBay to pay for groceries. Apparently this was the result of a computer program designed to clean house but as is often the case, many who had done nothing to deserve this were swept up in the mess. EBay remains completely unaccountable and people had no appeal or recourse. They could not complete sales which were made, they couldn't tie up loose ends...they went from heroes to bad people in one fell swoop. EBay has made it clear that it has an agenda to support big box sellers and Chinese manufacturers (who do not compete fairly because of cheaper postage rates and other trade agreement benefits). EBay no longer wants small sellers. They have treated them with disdain. EBay is no longer a good place to do business. Sales are down for most small sellers because EBay limits the search views to favoured (big box) sellers. EBay also in a cheap move stopped paying Google for as much access, cutting their sellers off at the knees (while charging them more). Because of the flawed Detailed Seller Rating system, sellers are often victimised by unscrupulous buyers who have become savvy in the ways of EBunk ... they know that EBay will side with them against sellers every time. Sellers who want to maintain their high feedback (without which they too will be purged) must often knuckle under to sellers who demand ""partial refunds"" (i.e., discounts) and who rant against an item (often before it has been delivered) and then when offered ""return for refund"" do not take it (all they wanted was a bribe). To be fair, most buyers on EBay are good ....it's just that the scammers have been enabled by EBay and now are rife there. EBay was once a wonderful place but since it was taken over by John Donahoe (formerly of Bain Capital) it has been turned into something different....and is no longer friendly and hospitable terrain. I'm saddened to have to be less than optimistic but the changes especially in the past year leave EBay watchers dismayed and do not hold out much hope for a good future there. Look for it to be another place to buy whatever they sell at Walmart and not much else. Don't get used to caring, nice small sellers...their days are numbered.",2,ebay.com
1112,"Ebay is great for a buyer. I love buying on ebay.  It is bad for small sellers. I've sold on ebay myself since 1999 and I find the friendly atmosphere and feeling of community you used to feel there has been on a rapid decline since about 2008.  My biggest beef is that there is no more authentic feedback system. A positive feedback left for a seller may not even be positive due to the detailed seller ratings star system. Most buyers probably do not know how much damage they are causing to a sellers account when leaving these 1 and 2 stars, and probably do it unwittingly. They don't MEAN to cause damage, but they do.  After three 1 or 2 star ratings, a seller can and probably will be banned, even with a 100% positive feedback rating.  Sellers are not allowed to leave anything but a positive feedback for a buyer, even if a buyer was difficult, abusive, unreasonable or did not pay, so there's no warnings for other sellers to heed. If you leave a message about the buyer in feedback that is less than glowing, ebay will sometimes remove it and warn you. The last line of defense for a seller these days is to ban certain buyers manually, problem is, when you figure out who to ban, it's usually too late - they've already ruined your DSR or cost you in fees when you have to re-list what they didn't pay for.",2,ebay.com
1113,I am not happy with my experience here. I usually order from amazon but decided to give this a try because of how cheap the prices are. It has taken over 3 weeks and my books have not arrived. I called customer service and the representative pretty much told me to wait it out. I mentioned I had an email that said my books have been delivered and my rental days have started counting down but he did not answer the question why. I would rather pay more on amazon or college book renter and actually get my books,2,ebay.com
1114,"As far as buying stuff on ebay you are pretty safe, just use common sense. Ebay has put up a lot of protective measures for the buyers over the years. I have still been scammed once many years ago (when most payments were made via Money Order), but 99% of my purchases have gone smoothly. So why the two star rating? Stephen P nailed it in his review. Buyers have so much protection now that it has gone from sellers scamming buyers to buyers scamming sellers. I had a 100% feedback rating with thousands of sales and then ebay changed many of their policies in favor of the buyer. Suddenly I was having buyers try and extort money out of me, telling me if I didn't send money to their Paypal account that they would leave negative feedback or claim they never received the item and due to ebays new policies I, as a seller, was powerless to do anything about it. I did not give in to the extortionists and as a result my feedback rating dropped, and as a result of that bidding on my items decreased. All of that along with the huge increases in ebay and PayPal fees caused me to finally close my ebay account after 15 years. Ebay has gotten very greedy over the years and this greed will ultimately lead to their demise.",2,ebay.com

Buying...well that's at your own risk; sometimes you will get really good deals and get what you payed for but...you can only take the seller's word for the quality of what you're getting, and not everyone will be honest.

1127,"Things change over time. We live in a world where online consumers all over the world are growing exponentially more sophisticated and knowledgeable on the choices they have - including the non-obvious ones they can manufacture/conjure. But, pioneers who become dominant players sometimes think they know it all and can let their foot off the pedal. They forget that dissent travels virally and far quicker and more robustly than positive sentiment. Additionally, as the adage ""necessity is the mother of invention"" is as true today as it ever was, arrogant, dominant players provide reasons for alternatives and substitutes to arise. (Wikipedia is a great source of information which I shall credit with some of the info in this review.) Ebay and its powerhouse offspring (that is fast outgrowing its ageing parent), Paypal, seem to be guilty of the above. (One cannot talk about Ebay without referring to Paypal, Ebay's ""unfair advantage"".) Notice how they change rules unilaterally without consultation with or regard for those who contribute so much to their success - e.g. requiring every seller in Australia and UK to accept Paypal; and taking away the rights of sellers to leave negative feedback for buyers, no matter how criminal or perverse their behaviour. Some of these rules could well fall foul of unfair contract laws - but with their deep combined pockets and army of legal minds, they are understandably not particularly perturbed by individual action. When Paypal moved from the UK to Luxembourg in 2007, they removed themselves from the relatively conscientious and onerous jurisdiction of the FSA and with it, the English, Welsh and Scottish courts.  Ebay and Paypal may think that they are too big to fail, but the welter of disenfranchisement among its user community remains very much a reality. (There are websites dedicated to the downfall of these monolithic entities.) To Paypal's credit, it has not just survived but thrived whilst others e.g. BidPay and PayDirect, have bitten the dust. For all intents and purposes, Paypal is a monopolist that is getting bigger by the day. Perhaps it's time the M&MC checked it out. I have been an 'ebayer' since early 2000 but am now looking for alternatives. Ebay and Paypal are very friendly to buyers but sellers (especially newbies) have a tougher time. I have noticed that some superb sellers I have often bought from in the past - who have had thousands of feedback - are no longer on ebay. Happily, I have managed to track down their own websites... When there are problems, getting through to Ebay/Paypal can be a grind. There are times I have called during their office hours only to hear (after having laboriously obtained and entered the PIN number, etc etc) ""your call cannot be taken at this time...""!! Messages left verbally or through their messaging system (and email) not infrequently get lost in transit (or translation??).  Even though Ebay/Paypal are huge organisations, a bit of personal touch from well-trained and empowered staff and some situation-specific flexibility (followed by fine-tuning of their systems) would certainly pay dividends in improving customer affection, referrals and loyalty (which immensely reduce cost of sales). I rate Amazon far above Ebay. I think I shall sell my ebay shares and buy Amazon...",2,ebay.com

1136,"Well, when eBay first started they were 100% in my book. But not recently, i.e., the last few years.... eBay has been allowing foreign counterfeit designer labels to get right through. And I've learned my lesson from buying through iOffer, which seems to be like the fake designer shopping site of the world, that counterfeit designer products are cheap, smelly, low quality, and look nothing like the photos, description, let alone the real thing. For example, this seller has been trying to sell what they are describing as an authentic COACH (rare, too) handbaghttp://cgi.ebay.com/COACH-Bonnie-Jeweled-Canvas-Caryall-Tote-Purse-Bag-NEW_W0QQitemZ300507989190QQcategoryZ63852QQcmdZViewItemQQ_trksidZp5197.m7QQ_trkparmsZalgo%3DLVI%26itu%3DUCI%26otn%3D1%26po%3DLVI%26ps%3D63%26clkid%3D7301249094219903584#ht_2552wt_1141 without any photos of the exact handbag, they're using stock photos. They mentioned they ""mutilated the price tag,"" hmm, maybe because it is not a real price tag? They also said ""I am in no way affiliated with Louis Vuitton"" yet they are selling a ""COACH"" product. Reeks of scam to me! But of course, no matter how many times I report it to eBay, eBay does nothing. Anyway, I'm digressing. I have been a buyer and a seller on eBay since the year 2005. When I am selling, I get charged too many fees, so I make the same profit as I would at a garage sale. When I am buying, I am usually paying full retail price for used stuff! The sellers seem to *have* to jack the prices up in order to make a garage-sale profit! I've also gotten ripped off as a seller - I sold a girl some shoes which were brand new, in the box the box was packaged within a shipping box, and insured. She wanted a refund and to keep my shoes too. eBay recommended in the Resolution Center that I only refund her if she sends the shoes back to me. She refused. I did get to keep my profit, and she got to keep my shoes, plus eBay refunded her too because they found ""neither party at fault."" Okay eBay, if you have the cash to fork over to scammers like her, it's your loss. But what does eBay care? They make up for it bigtime in fees. And that's not to mention Paypal fees. I don't buy often on eBay but when I do I have to put extra effort into making sure I'm not getting ripped off...which is a lot lately. My advice is if you're selling take insane amounts of photos of your product, and take photos of the packaging process too. If you're a buyer ask for close up (macro) shots of some of the fine detail of the product. This is good for some designer labels that won't authenticate their products. If you get photos of a genuine product and receive a fake product, you can take close-up shots of the fake product's detail and hold it against the detailed photos of the product you thought you were getting. In short... Just go to the store.",2,ebay.com

1148,"I have been on ebay for many years and have not had any problems worth mentioning. For the time being, it is a good site for buying and selling. But as good as their site is, I think it could it could be much better. They just need to stop trying to be like Amazon. If I wanted to buy and sell on Amazon, I would be using Amazon. Ebay has been taken over. They are catering to the big corporations and drop shippers, each of whom sells tens of thousands of items, if not hundreds of thousands. These businesses are ruining ebay because they flood the search pages with thousands of identical duplicate listings that may vary in price by a few pennies, or just a letter or two in the title. It is near impossible to compete as a seller in a market that is saturated with cheaper quality items that always seem to be at the top of the search results, but in a way, that competition makes it a good site to buy on. But check Amazon before buying on ebay, because many of the big sellers and drop shippers are using ebay to list their items and then have them shipped through their Amazon Prime accounts. Of course, in cases like that, the ebay prices will be a few dollars more than Amazon. Maybe they will merge someday. Another thing I feel happening on ebay is that the seller is gradually losing control over how they run their business on ebay. Rules and regulations, and even more rules and regulations. And the fees! If they raise them again anytime soon, I think that the smaller sellers will begin to leave in waves and then ebay would become something like an online Walmart, a truly irrelevant online marketplace. They need to remember where they came from. They need to remember their roots before they are cut down.",3,ebay.com

1150,"As almost everyone knows, ebay has high seller fees which has made a lot of sellers leave, which leaves most of the seller's from overseas. The shipping charges some sellers utilize is absolutely astounding...crazy high, I mean, there is no way that a bottle of nail polish costs $8 to ship or a shirt ships for $12, but because ebay allows any shipping to be entered you will encounter eye popping prices, so, if you factor in high fees and higher shipping costs, ebay isn't really a great option..now to be fair not all sellers gouge on shipping and you can get a great deal, but they are few and far between. Unless of course you buy from China, which is the majority of sellers, than you can get a fantastic deal, but it is from China, so most likely to be low quality and a two month wait to receive if you receive it. Overall, it's okay but not my first or second choice in online buying.",3,ebay.com

1156,"Depending on what I use Ebay for my experiences vary wildly.  First, the good: the site is fairly easy to use, you can set up an ad and sell your unwanted stuff or take it a step further. It used to be a bit easier before they set their ridiculous standard of 500 pix minimum for pictures (yes, I like clear photos, but zooming in a tad further on some would get you more info). If an ad has a bad photo you can always ask to clarify. With a standard, unpaid account you get 50 listings free (auction or buy it now) which is nice. The bad: Yes, there are some scammer out there on both sides of the spectrum (I buy and sell there myself, so I have seen both). I strongly suspect the site has an algorithm working for it as well; if it suspects it can sell you something say goodbye to ever getting any 'extra' free ad space. I keep my buying separate from my selling (allowed) and I get free listing offers on my buying account all the time which are never mirrored on my selling account (which I don't use). And I do mean NEVER. The ugly: customer service. Good God, the customer service. As a seller, no matter what the issue, just save yourself the aggravation and don't call them unless you have a couple of hours to spare and are prepared to take it to the top. The 'seller protection' means nothing, that's just a marketing trick. Don't fall for the 'we'll call you back' either; believe me, they won't and you will have to start all over again. Honestly... there is no service there. Over the years i have used Ebay I have gotten so aggravated with this part of it that if a viable competitor were to arrive (and no, it's not you Shopify) I would jump without question.",3,ebay.com

Since I marked the item as no returns accepted she tried getting ebay to make me refund her money. I spoke with customer service probably 4 or 5 times. Every time I spoke with them they would say they had my back and that this is a clear case of buyers remorse.  They would say they will not honor the return and I did everything I was supposed to do and more. Every time I called they would tell me one thing and the next couple of days I would see on my account that the complete opposite would happen. In the end after being lied to so many times, the buyer was refunded and kept the product. So i lost $70 and my merchandise. Moral of the story, do not listen to a thing Ebay customer service says. It doesn't matter.",3,ebay.com
1159,"I've bought and sold on eBay for many years as it's still the biggest, most legitimate place for new and pre-owned items. eBay has changed the rules so that sellers can get completely scammed by dishonest buyers no matter how detailed and accurate the listing is and it's happening more and more so I don't bother to sell anymore. The fees to sell have risen drastically and the buyer has all of the rights, the seller none. The feedback system is a great idea-those of you who are complaining about things you have purchased need to look closer at a seller's feed back and actually read the comments before you buy. I have virtually never received anything I've purchased that hasn't been exactly as described. And finally, like most companies who are ""too big to care"", it is virtually impossible to contact a real human being for issues and questions. They simply don't want to be bothered and there is no phone number for customer service. If you email them, you will get back a ""form letter"" response that doesn't address the issue.

It's a little bit confusing if you plan on buying something that doesn't come from a well-known brand. Some products are cheap but the quality is good, some others are just terrible.

I spent thousands of dollars on eBay during the first 4-5 years I was a customer. However, over the last few years, I often forget it's even there. I go straight to Amazon, Overstock, etc. The primary reason is the site is less intuitive than it was in the past when I used it heavily. Site navigation is not optimal and it takes too long to try and figure out where to go. Being in IT, I am pretty internet/computer savvy.

1179,"I have been selling on eBay for over 17 yrs. Wow, it was great in the beginning! In fact, I was able to make it my only job for a period of time in the past. However as time went on, rules became more stringent for sellers and more lax for buyers. In the recent years, I have had buyers take advantage of the ""not as described"" reason for return. Once a buyer states this as a reason for return, it automatically means the seller pays for return shipping. A buyer can be a nightmare and no way to let the public know because no negatives or even neutral is able to be given to a buyer. I have sold one item that I know was working and the buyer claimed it did not. When they returned the heavy item (lots of return postage I had to pay) I got back a DIFFERENT item than the one I shipped out. However eBay still gave them their money and I was left with a damaged non working item AND my money. Recently someone claimed I sent a different item than the one in the listing claiming ""the stitching looks different"". I had no similar item so no way that was possible. This is all so frustrating dealing with the buyers that get snotty and accusatory. So after 17 yrs, I am hanging it up! I Will still be a buyer because now I know I can return anything at someone elses expense if the notion hits me. I can also buy a similar model electronics item and say ""not as described"" and return to them my old dead one at their expense! They do have many bargains so it is a great place to buy.

By contrast UK/US sellers seem to be for the most part honest and I have rarely had reason to doubt them.

1214,ebay can be a good shopping website to buy from if you can tell between scammers and legitimate sellers I only got scammed once on ebay but most of the transactions I made were pretty good there seems to be lot of bad sellers on ebay always check the amount of positive and negative feedback and you should be fine with buying off of ebay atleast with amazon.com there are hardly any scammers,3,ebay.com
1215,"I'm both a buyer and a seller on Ebay. I completely support the concept of people being able to run a small internet based business to supplement their income. I salute those people. What I do not appreciate is big businesses that offer horrible customer service and lack of business ethics ripping people like me off and Ebay simply allows it. I recently made a large purchase that was listed as ""free shipping"" yet when it was delivered I had to pay shipping. I contacted the seller and they pretty much told me too bad, I wouldn't be reimbursed. I contacted ebay and they said they couldn't help me. Ebay doesn't offer buyer protection, they offer protection to the sellers who sell thousands of items a day. Shame on you Ebay!",3,ebay.com

1219,Size has now been removed on the left hand toolbar when looking for clothing. I can't work out why. Size is the most important criteria for choosing clothing however to eBay that is obviously not a concern as it was removed over 2 months ago and despite repeated complaints it has not be reinstated. Why would you remove a search feature from a search engine to make searching more difficult particularly when this feature has been present ever since using eBay in 2008. Will be shopping elsewhere in the future. Suspect some marketing ploy so people have look over many more items of clothing to find what they want thus possibly increasing sales. A big Turn off.,3,ebay.com

1222,"When I think back on beginning to sell on eBay it was so exciting.all my stuff out their to millions of shoppers.after years realizing I have worked my behind off..just the other day took a road I had not been on in years to realize all business had shut down,all the hype about selling online and making money what you do not know is how many business have closed down.i bet it's more than what is open for business,um I will post more later got to try to make a dime for now. I am very very frustrated with buying wholesale women's clothing.i have really made changes this year by not buying much wholesale.i use to find great deals and for almost this entire year,nada.the prices are priced for boutiques not eBay..hello wholesaler if I were going to pay your high prices for what I call fashion name brand i would buy name brand not fashion clothing. I have sold one of everything on eBay,started with phones,electronics etc to gift bags ,clothing finally deciding to sew a few items and try that. I have found nothing that I want to repeatedly buy to sell and make a profit.a penny profit is not worth the trip to the mailbox is my story.if there is gold mine could someone let me in on it.a friend of mine said if you list it it will sell.B-o-l-o--g-n-y",3,ebay.com
1223,I used to love shopping and looking for bargains on Ebay. But the it's getting harder and harder to find good bargains. Seems there are more and more people who are addicted to buying from ebay and sellers are taking advantage of these people. There was a report on tv about this and it's getting worse. We need more competition to ebay. But not these sites I saw on tv. A real bidding site like Ebay. Maybe Ebay and Amazon will end up budding heads and customers can benefit from it. I hope so.,3,ebay.com
1224,Good overall but disappointed by sellers' tendency to try to buy you off so you don't post the truth about a poor product.,3,ebay.com
1225,I never really had to many bad transactions till lately. It seems like one after another. I did 3 charges in a week from being scammed,3,ebay.com

1227,"I contacted a seller with a question more than a week ago, TWICE and they never responded. I thought perhaps for some reason they may not be getting my question so I contacted eBay with the concern and they said they would not send them an email notifying them of this. I realize an emergency might have kept them away but still, a notification of some type must be possible and if not eBay should make one easily incorporated as an auto response to question in such a case. So what if half the sellers on eBay decided to put their items on there then just sit back and ignore potential buyers, is that good business practice? Rather a turn off to me and I went elsewhere",3,ebay.com
1228,"Selling on Ebay is pretty easy to do. Buying is somewhat risky. I own a webstore, and ebay can be helpful to promote your website by leaving a link to your 'Terms' page on your website on a listing. I recommend if you can't find a specialist for what you seek, use Ebay.",3,ebay.com
1229,I have bought 6 things on Ebay the past 2 months and 4 of them tried to scam me---Not good odds.,3,ebay.com
1230,"It was much cooler before, now it takes lots of time to find great quality on ebay. We need more new ebays with quality control.",3,ebay.com
1231,"To many people out there who seek to buy an item for a lesser price than average, there can only be two options: stealing, or the more legal approach, eBay. I've been an eBay buyer and seller since 2009 and have always used it as my source of secondary income or to find items for considerably less. It's been a good run so far and the fact that my product is exposed to a worldwide audience is what captivates me about the power of the internet. I list an item, within a couple days it sells, I get paid, I ship the item out, I get reviewed, and I build up my reputation with my expertise in sales.  Now, why the 3 star review and not 5? Although eBay is great for both the seller and buyer, it is tough to begin with. I'm not talking about listing the product and trying to get it out there, no. EBay has made it very easy for beginning sellers or buyers to buy/sell items all around with basic buttons and listing tools as well more advanced options for experienced sellers. I'm talking about their fees and their ""protection"" plans. Ebay takes 10 percent of whatever value you sell your product for, up to a maximum of a $250 fee (ex. I sell a product for $100, eBay takes $10. I sell a product for $2500, eBay takes $250. I sell a product for $2501 or higher, eBay still takes $250). Not bad considering it's an auction site when most auctions charge upwards of 20-30 percent of your items final selling price.  Now, what bugged me were the hidden fees such as the 10 percent shipping fee or with eBay's choice of payment, PayPal, taking 3.9 percent of whatever the buyer pays.  To break it down for you, say I sell a product for $100 + $10 shipping. The buyer must pay $110 to me through PayPal in order for the transaction to go through and for me to ship the product out. Once paid, eBay will deduct $10 as a final value fee, $1 as a shipping fee, and PayPal will deduct $4.29 as a transaction fee. That leaves me with $94.71. This can get confusing for some sellers, especially new sellers who may find it difficult to calculate the right price for their item without losing money on it. Another problem mentioned was their ""protection"" or ""eBay Money Back Guarantee/Buyer Protection/Seller Protection"" I understand eBay wants to help the buyer and seller as much as they can, acting as the police force for anything that may go wrong in a transaction, but it can be taken too far sometimes.  If a person were to sell a product to a buyer and it is not in the condition as described, the buyer may have the option to open a case against the seller to request money back from them due to false information. If the seller complies all is well. If the seller does not comply, big big uh-oh. Say I sold a genuine Louis Vuitton purse, valued at $2500 over eBay. I explain in the listing it is a genuine product and provide proof of it being real as well as my policies. A person buys the purse, I get paid, I ship it to them, but the buyer isn't too sure of it being real when he/she receives it, so he/she wants to return it and opens a case against me. I have strict evidence proving the purse is in fact real and will not accept such a return for that reason provided. So in a moment like that, eBay will step in, deduct the money from me out of the blue and refund the buyer. A loss of a sale there, but I still get the purse back right? Wrong. Ebay requires the buyer send the product to eBay for them to inspect and DESTROY. So not only do I lose the sale, but I lose the product too! All because a buyer may claim to be a Louis Vuitton purse professional and has suspicion it may be fake, even though everything checks out as real. All this is from years of using eBay and having to learn the hard way how these inner fees and services actually work. If you are looking to buy an item for well below retail price or a crown jewel, eBay is your place to be. If you are looking to sell an item for profit, as a business strategy, or to just get rid of junk, eBay also serves as that haven, but do your research ahead of time and beware of fees and possible troubles you may run into with buyers. To eBay directly, if you are reading this, please correct me in anything that may have possibly changed in your policies or operations. I am more than willing to listen and understand how these operations go and to ensure my experience goes smoothly the next time I sell as well as others experiences with your site as well. Thank you!",3,ebay.com

1236,"I have been selling on ebay for several years and have had an overall good experience. The one thing I do not like about ebay is how hard it is to talk to a real person. Also ebay is not very supportive of protecting the seller from irresponsible buyers who give negative feedback that is unsupported. The best thing about ebay is the international reach for sellers. Most people on ebay are good, responsible buyers and seller, but as has been pointed out watch for feedback ratings before doing business with sellers or buyers.",3,ebay.com
1237,I have purchased a system. I rate them an A+. The transaction and product are exactly what the seller states. I am very much satisfied with this product.,3,ebay.com
1238,Ebay will never favor sellers and it is not a very fair site to sell on. Buyers can and so (I know) claim an item is not as advertised. If you offer full refund including return shipping and they say no and continue their claim to ebay they DO AND WILL get to keep the item and receive a full refund from ebay. Ebay will tell the seller that the buyer is returning the item but that is an out right lie.  If you appeal ebay will do absolutely nothing. This happened to me again last week and no response from ebay after reporting the buyer and trying to appeal his claim. Ebay is not bad most of the time but is not seller friendly so BEWARE. dwhall12,3,ebay.com

I stopped selling altogether and when I did this my rating was significantly improved back to top seller. We both made no money and the customers could not buy my products. I understand them but you need to be flexible and not expect too much. The fees they charge is their business. What I get is my business and I did very well. I dont sell there regularly...not because of them (EBAY) but some buyers are unrealistic  and they represent a very small portion of the buyers. They are enough for you to not sell. Its a sad commentary that these few control the mood of the thing. So I gave up......Might I say most of the buyers are very nice and very honest.,3,ebay.com

Once they changed the feedback rules a few years ago (sellers cannot leave negative feedback for crappy, scamming buyers) it all went downhill from there.

Called paypal customer service it did not offer specific help and hard to understand(believed it is outsourced ,India?) Next I tried email them, got response pretty fast compared to the time it took to explain the problem to them. I was told they would fix it,tryed to use the checkout process again but was declined. Emailed again, same response or told to call giving me the same number i called before,just a big run around. I went through that several times, before i gave up. Their response was the same thing, it was automated web forms with a different name on it.     I had to remove my bank account and my credit cards from paypal to keep them from getting ruined.  Made payment for my purchase by good ole American Mother Lovin cashiers check. Now i have no confidence in their payment process or customer support, now will ask sellers if they will accept chashiers check or usps money order to pay for a purchase, if not I won't bid. I thought I might sell items myself , i would hate to be on sellers side that kind of problem.  To this day was not told what went wrong or if really really fixed.  Now just hanging out in space.

1246,I have had fun purchasing on eBay for the last 2 years and have sold 2 items successfully. I have recently listed an Hermes wallet only to have the listing pulled because they claim it is fake. I bought it on eBay and have since found a color I like better. I shop Hermes and I know it is authentic. I am redoing the sale site with better photos and am willing to pay to have it authenticated by a reputable online site. No problem. The problem I have is that there are several obviously fake wallets listed in my category and eBay will do nothing about them. Reporting the listing does no good.

1258,"My sister turned me onto Ebay before the frenzy a few years back. Over the years I have seen the good, the bad and the ugly. I will say that Ebay went through many growing pains over the years, trying to keep it as even a playing field as possible. They had to deal with bad sellers, scamming folks or holding purchasers hostage threatening negative feedback if you left them anything less than perfect feedback on their transaction. They have grown and tried to put in place protections for both the sellers and buyers. Ebay's Paypal is another profit making arm, however providing a great service for folks to be able to transfer funds without having to reveal confidential information. As Ebay has grown, so have other options (you go to Ebay for bargains or hard to find items that someone just may be trying to off-load to get some spare money) Far too often I find another major internet site that started off as a book seller has better prices, and much more of a track record in providing reliable, efficient service.

The T-shirt material and color was very nice and of good quality, even the frock was very nice, but the size of the frock was of a newly born child. I immediately called ebay and told them. Few hours later, I got a call from the company from where this product was delivered, from somewhere in Mumbai. They took all the details and told me that they will pick up the frock from my house and will pay me back the money. And to my surprise, really the courier came and took it back, giving me a receipt, and just as they promised, after 15 working days, they returned my money also. This was my first experience with them. Now again, I got one new link of ebay, daily.ebay.in.  Its a food store and we can buy international brand food items from there. I again ordered for one cookies packet, one dry fruit packet and one lemon chutney from there.

1282,"I was a e-bay buyer for many years. It was the first site I would call up when I needed anything. I liked the feeling that I was helping the small business person. Because I didn't have a bad transaction that couldn't be resolved by myself and the seller, I believed that e-bay would stand behind the offers made by their sellers and if a seller made a mistake, it wouldn't cost me . Then I ordered delicate beer glasses from Sharper Image during one of e-bays ""Black Friday"" deals and paid via credit card. When the glasses arrived, the box ""jingled"" and I knew there was broken glass. I enlisted the UPS delivery man to take the package back. We opened the box and he asked me to agree that there was NO packing material in the box. He said UPS was not at fault and I must go thru the seller for resolution.  With this information, I contacted Sharper Image who said I should throw out the broken glass and they would refund the full order price. Time passed and no refund. I opened an e-bay dispute and was royally screwed: e-bay INSISTED I must return the broken glass to the Sharper Image even tho I had a note saying I should throw out the product. Luckily my husband hadn't discarded the box and I was able to comply, but my enthusiasm for dealing with a site that doesn't use common sense .... I had the UPS statement outlining damage and cause .... I had the Sharper Image agreement .... why should I pay return postage ($10 on a $25 purchase)? But that is e-bay policy and that was that.  The day I mailed the box, I received an e-mail from Sharper Image saying they credited my credit card (they belatedly honored their agreement with me). I didn't need to return the product at all.  To add to the bad customer support, e-bay sent a note telling me how well they had done in resolving my case: 100% refund!  Their response to my feedbacks that I only received a 60% refund - I paid 40% in postage was a ""we got you 100% refund"". Who needs an advocate who adheres strictly to the ""script"" despite a solid case for an exception and who can't calculate an accurate refund amount. I consider myself lucky the shipping was only $10 ... it could have been much worse!  I now use e-bay ONLY if I can't find the product on Amazon or elsewhere on-line and use PayPal whenever possible. They do offer an amazing variety of products.",3,ebay.com
1283,"It is what it is. Joined in...1999? 2000? darkone67. Have seen many changes, and not all for the better. The latest insult (that I am aware of) was sellers not being able to leave anything but positive feedback for buyers, or anyone (not) being able to view someone's buying history to check for shill bidding - that's a sham. Sham, not shame, though THAT, too. I am, or was, a major buyer with over 1000 positive feedback (no negs), and a seller with something over 50 (no negs)...but selling has become expensive, overfee'd and not worth the time. I still peruse the site for off-season and EUC to purchase, but as for selling what I could offer as a great deal...costs me more than I make when considering time put in to put up quality images, list in detail and ship. Forget it.",3,ebay.com
1284,Fees are getting too high. They are catering to the big sellers and its not near as efficient to sell occasionaly. Ebay buying paypal hasn't been good. Now it is much harder to find and use your paypal account in relation to EBAY then it used to be.,3,ebay.com
1285,"As a buyer I love eBay and can get great deals - although not as easily as in years past. As a seller I am constantly aware of the high cost of doing business on eBay, so it stands to reason that, as eBay continues to increase my cost of selling, my prices must go up and buyers, like me, can't get as good of a deal as in years past. One simply leads to the other. eBay does a good job of providing a safe buying environment, and their site continually improves with regard to features and ease of use. On the selling side, eBay has some major issues. eBay now makes profit on the amount charged for shipping even though sellers like me charge actual shipping COST. Unbelievable!! I've read many stories of good sellers being suddenly shut down without any explanation from eBay. Many times these sellers made their entire income from eBay sales. Ebay has been, and is currently being, sued for callous acts of this sort. eBay makes it literally impossible for a seller to give anything but positive feedback to a buyer - even if the buyer is a liar, cheat and overall a--hole. eBay cares 97% for customers and about 3% for sellers. It's virtually impossible to get unfair negative feedback removed from a seller's record because of eBay's gigantic ""customer is always right"" bias. It's just a sad fact! Problem is, unhappy sellers can make for more unhappy customers. I urge eBay to consider the once all-powerful Howard Johnson restaurant chain. The owner(s) sat back and counted their money - resting on their sizable laurels. Meanwhile, a guy named Ray Kroc took a small hamburger stand and worked his butt off to build it into a behemoth restaurant chain - never resting and always re-investing his profits into more and more locations. The chain is called McDonald's! By the way, the Howard Johnson restaurant chain, once the country's largest, no longer exists. Not even one location survives!!!! eBay should keep an eye out for all the other web sites vying for the top auction site spot. eBay better not ignore and mistreat their sellers much longer. There WILL be another Ray Kroc out there who'd love to welcome those sellers to his site!! There simply isn't enough room on this page to explain ALL the bad things about selling on eBay. But, their huge size still enables me to make money, so I will keep looking for the right alternative selling site while I swallow my pride as an eBay seller. C'mon Ray Kroc, Jr. Where are you?!?!",3,ebay.com
1286,"I have thought long and hard on a review for ebay. I don't use them very often, neither ever did. Infrequently, I will purchase an unusual tchotchke; book or excuse me, fetish-sorta implement. I had one odd experience with them, several years back. The seller and then ebay became demanding on my slow response to rating the sale. I had not used the item - so I was rushed into a review. I refused to order through them for over 2 years, till I saw a book, that I could not easily acquire anywhere else. This sale was fine. Still, I don't use this site often.",3,ebay.com

1290,"I have been a Seller and a Buyer on eBay. In disgust, I gave up my membership. eBay has become a Buyers dream, as there continues to be many thousands of Sellers who allow eBay to charge them disproportionately high fees, then to disrespect them by never backing them up against unjustifiable complaints. To put is simply, all that a ""Buyer"" needs to do to vent their frustration is to enter a ""Negative"" against a Seller. To get the ""Negative"" removed the Seller must refund all of the ""Buyers"" costs, not expect to have the item returned, then the ""Seller"" must beg the ""Buyer"" to voluntarily remove the ""Negative"". This happened to me twice in about 750 ""Positives"". As always, I had done as I promised, but the first ""Buyer"" simply gave feedback stating ""This isn't what I had expected"" then gave a Negative ... not once did he write me as eBay says they should, and eBay totally backed the ignorant Buyer, not helping me whatsoever. ""The last time a Buyer gave me a Negative, he stated that a banknote which he won ""looked like a copy""; however it was crisp uncirculated and genuine. Again, no writing to me, which would have resulted in a refund, as it's much easier to refund than to try to argue with a fool. But eBay would not intercede, nor back me up. Instead it assured me that I could not give either ""Buyer"" a Negative, or to state that they had not even once attempted to contact me, as a Seller being able to tell the truth or to defend themselves is against eBay's policy! .......... I cancelled my eBay auctions and told them that once they apologized to me, changed the rules to protect their honest & decent Sellers, and refunded me my losses, that I would again sell on their website. Instead, they've continued to bill me for the auctions which I cancelled.  eBay is run by folks who have figured how to maximize their profitability, and to do the least work to maintain. They have created so many rules to protect themselves, and to ignore their own Sellers. Their seemingly honest efforts of working with the Sellers, always result with referring the Seller to this or that rule and regulation, and requiring documentation upon documentation, then going their happy way knowing that for every defense that the Seller may offer, that there was a rule with which they would find impossible to comply! For example, for a Seller to send an item to the ""Buyer"" who is determined to rip them off, a Seller must send the goods with Insurance, and Signature Required ... only to have the ""Buyer"" state that the package was empty or had rocks, etc."" in it instead. There's no way to defend yourself against an unscrupulous ""Buyer"", and eBay won't even allow a Seller to enter Negative Feedback against any ""Buyer""! ((With this rule, eBay avoids a lot of ""Unnecessary Work""!)) Although it may seem counter-productive, because they are still the major on-line auction, many Sellers simply pray that they don't become prey to the bad Buyers. I will not sell on eBay again until they acquiesce to my demands of fairness, apologize to me, and refund me. However, that day is not in the foreseeable future.",3,ebay.com
1291,"Good variety of products, used it several times to purchase cheap electronics. If you want to sell keep an eye out cause the fees are high.",3,ebay.com
1292,"Not a big fan of this site. I do like how sometimes you can find some decent and rare items but I don't like the bidding system or that the same user posts the same item a handful of times, it kinda makes you wonder if they actually have the item in the quantity that the post for sale or if they're trying to cheat the system and sell it to the one that has the highest bids and then delete the others.",3,ebay.com
1293,"I like using Ebay, lots of items at your finger tips without walking, wide selection without needing to track into different real shops. 30 day Money back insurance and the feeling of safety. Pay with Paypal and you get another 150 days (180 from the day you get the item). Just do not be dumb, if something looks to good to be true and you buy it, expect the worst to arrive at your door. YOU get nothing for free or for mere pennies in this world. Sometimes you end up lucky if you buy something cheap. I have purchased everything from a brand new mattress, fridge freezer, make-up, cheese and wine etc...so far no problems with service or returns as you can involve Ebay or Paypal to sort anything out. I never buy used just because l see that as gross, l have purchased antique Japanese carvings but never pre-owned clothing, electrics or anything. Delivery depends on the seller and distance, ball park times are given.",4,ebay.com
1294,"Everything on ebay tends to favor the buyer. I have been buying & selling on ebay for over 17 years. Unfortunately it is difficult for sellers because there are to many fees and the items for sale are very competitive (price wise). When you sell something you have to pay a 10% ebay fee, 3% PayPal fee and the seller has to pay for $&H. This is why I prefer to buy instead of sell. I am no longer afraid to buy from sellers with zero feedback. Ebay guarantees every auction. Transactions are very safe and Ebay and PayPal both have phone support. Ebay has the best exposure. On the top 10 list for hits on the internet. Amazon is number one.",4,ebay.com

I've never had a bad transaction on the platform, but don't do that many deals there. Compared to Amazon, it's about 100:1 in favor of Amazon. One complaint, the interface between buyer and seller is clunky and takes too long to get an answer; plus you have to go through several questions within their interface before they'll let you send an email. Perhaps its greatest utility is to value used stuff.  Overall, I recommend EBAY for select items.",4,ebay.com

When buying I check Seller Reviews and if something sounds hinky I'd rather pay more than get jerked around. My seller experience is okay except US P.O. took too long once and buyer complained to ebay furst, not to me. I monitored it and it finally arrived late and he was disappointed but sometimes mail does get delayed or take a long time if someone in rural area or gets stolen in high density residential area. And I am not responsible for porch thieves!",4,ebay.com
1304,"With eBay as a seller you know the rules and you can always feel protected say when a buyer says they did not receive their item even though tracking shows as delivered. CHa Ching. eBay works with tracking. If it shows delivered case closed. eBay used to work very very very well back in 2013 but then they had some security breach and the sales stopped very suddenly. Then they did a site wide delete of all products without a UPC code and you had to go through one by one to edit each ad! What a headache and just recently did the same thing for external links. Now I know I did not place a lot of those links in our listings, but still they push that on sellers to have to do that one by one. What a headache! They should pay us! Four times a years they offer free $$ of shipping supplies with ebay logo. They offer a lot of ways to try to generate sales like eBucks, Percentage off. They work hard to try to help the seller save some money but they also take so much and I sometimes feel we pay too much in fee's but when we do our taxes I see we do make an income. There are scams on ebay but not as much as Amazon. There is a lot to say as we have been on ebay a long time. I like eBay but sometimes we hate eBay and I am tired of feedbacks staying on an account for one year! Seems so excessive. Okay three months. And when you try so hard to be right and still get an idiot to leave you a neg. But then I place them in a bad buyers list so everyone can know he or she was an idiot.",4,ebay.com

I've found that if you check back often you may find some really great deals. You have the option to buy the items now or some you have the option to bid on. Which is one of my favorite features of this site. I won a pair of new plus size jeans for $5.89 plus $10.00 shipping & a new pair of black & white striped Old Navy flip flops for just $4.00 (shipping included). Since sellers are able to set their own prices , you will find some truly ridiculous prices throughout the site. Don't let that throw you , they are plenty of great deals & truly fair price listings there as well.",4,ebay.com
1307,I've been using eBay for several years and have spent several thousand dollars in purchases. All of a sudden they blocked my account so I can't even get on it. I called them and talk to customer service and wish they told me they suspended my account over a $32 bill that is 10 years old and I have never been notified of this nor believe that it's even my bill. They couldn't tell me over the phone what it was for. The lady said it's probably just insertion fees for pictures when I sold things through them. I cannot believe this because they always Bill my PayPal account and took the money out right away as soon as I placed any ads. I haven't sold anything in a long time through eBay and they still won't unblock my account unless I pay them for a bill that I'm not even sure that I owe. It's kind of funny how they took so long to bring up this bill and still no notification has ever been given for this matter. They'd rather lose me as a customer than admit that they might have made an error and just dismiss the bill that is like I said 10 years old. What a crappy company that can pull something like this on a person and then just expect them to hand over money 10 years later not knowing if it's really owed or not.,4,ebay.com

I also buy and sell and am not familiar with the majority of complaints I've read here. It's been a few years since I've sold things so maybe I will be in for a rude awakening.

It activated just fine, the problem is it doesn't keep time. It runs 5plus hours behind, wifi doesn't hold, I requested a return with no word from buyer. It is easy to charge a persons credit card, but hard to get people nowadays to admit they got a problem, I have decided for a few reasons that it is not a good season to sell or buy on ebay. Buyers & Sellers catch a bad rap. If you are not a big name, you probably don't get your item out there before you have to relist, more fee's. Auction style listings is just a license now to steal expensive products. People bid on your items and then don't pay, or claim they thought it was new. I just came back to ebay, and I will be leaving just as quick. I will pay my bill and delete my listings and close my account. This is not the season to support any business, that is shaky about supporting you. I will take a loss on the phone purchase and list it on another marketplace with truthful facts and the bigger loser will be the seller, who's reputation won't hold water as news travel that his or her products are indeed questionable. I am a vendor, who moves products, and work with people who also sold on ebay for years, but outrageous fees or too many problems pushed them right out the door. Ebay is a large marketplace, so you can expect problems down the road. I just assume keep it small, and have a say in my product.",4,ebay.com
1320,I have purchased a number of fake gemstones like dyed green quartz sold as emerald and amethyst that is purple glass. ebay is pretty good if you complain in a timely manner but they need to do a better job of getting rid of false labeled gemstones.

I still uses ebay but rely on mostly trusted sellers and reading reviews of past buyers helps to ensure your getting what you pay for. I did lose hundreds of dollars on fake and mislabeled gems because I did not have a gem tester earlier and missed the window to get a refund.

SO Unaware of those option (not like i'd pursue them) i set out to sell anything i found in estate & yard sales Etc. of Course as everything evolves so was the marketplace and Ebay's constantly changing policies. That's one of my biggest pet peeves against ebay how they constantly keep ""improving"" the platform... and now it has evolved to the point where sellers cannot leave a negative feedback for any buyer rather they can report a buyer, the vice versa is not so true.  If one being a seller gets a negative feedback depending on the buyers ""mood"" having nothing to do with service or quality of the item. but then again that's 1 out of several hundred transactions. IF you do Decide to Become A seller This is What i'd Advise : start casually. ebay gives you 50 free auctions a month. thats quite plenty. make yourself a neat template in Open Office of Word .  learn to do live listings so you are comfortable with the platform. no matter how much i hurry to do a good listing takes at least 20 minutes ** researching the item *** taking optimal photos showcasing strengths and weaknesses *** measure weight and dimension ** write a few specific words about the item ***  thats all is necessary to do a great listing. make sure you opt into global shipping.  For Domestic Shipping since Ebay is very competitive I list With free shipping meaning price included. so consider all that when researching price. In the listing it shows i Provide free Priority shipping, but when it comes to actual shipping if it goes to a major urban center and it is under 13oz it will go out as first class to save a bit of $... if it's rural or it's over 13 oz then it has to go in a bubble padded priority envelope (x2.3,4) i have shipped christmas brandy glasses wrapped 4 times in bubble wrap and they made it 2000k intact!!! so yes. the most important part of the sale. make sure you pack secure!! extra extras secure and keep the weights within range to keep shipping cost low. super important in e commerce. also if you can pass that on to your customer you have the edge over people that charge an extra 5-8$ in shipping for same item.  So. as much as we do not like Ebay. they are still very relevant.  i ship items across the world with the global shipping program so the headache of international shipping is not on me. Ebay is still top dog for items and traffic of all auction sites even though 2/3 op the inventory is fixed priced items.. hope this is helpful to someone out there.",4,ebay.com
1362,"eBay is good with the exception being the emails they send about items they have chosen 'especially for me'. The items they ""choose"" have NOTHING to do with Anything I have ever searched for! I have been unable to find out if I choose to discontinue those emails if it will stop emails regarding the items I DO want and have on my Watch or Bid lists...",4,ebay.com
1363,Had a few purchases via this site. Everything went well however my friend had some problems with a shady seller. I guess thats one of the major problems - review the seller b4 you are about to make a purchase.,4,ebay.com
1364,"Yes, you can easily find anything you need on Ebay. Ive had some troubles with individual sellers, but my overall experience is positive. Theres no better site for finding second-hand clothes and gadgets in perfect condition. I often order cosmetics and hair products that are not available in my country. It just makes my life easier.",4,ebay.com
1365,"Its a lottery, huge $#*!en lottey with bids of a few dollars so you can win in this lottery and get something cool for small money, but at the same time you can get nothing or just some kind of trash.

1366,Usually I can find what I need.,4,ebay.com
1367,"I've used it for four years and I have few complaints. I've even sold on it. The customer service is fast, considering it's a massive organisation. Most things are thought of and the site is comprehensive. I've had a few issues with buyer and sellers, but they've usually sorted themselves out. The protection on purchases also is really good. Allows the buyer and forces the seller to be ethical.",4,ebay.com
1368,eBay is good here always find what you want very convenient,4,ebay.com
1369,"I have been using eBay for a number of years and only buy items. I'm located in Bermuda and is quite limited to goods, so an online marketplace is my best friend. I buy from a wide range of sellers from different global locations.Generally, American orders arrive here faster but are usually more expensive goods. Likewise, Chinese goods are cheaper but sometimes a lower quality. Most of my disputes relate to packages not arriving and few arrive months after, which forces me to send a separate paypal transaction to return the refund. This being said, if I was a seller- I have to recognize that there's down-market competition, shipping time is vital for western sellers and not every person will return the items or repay if receive them late. I find eBay to be fair in their judgments. If you don't provide tracking or verified document from a courier stating the item was delivered- how can eBay decide in favor for the seller. I find most of the ""Scam"" of eBay is in their auctions. People make false accounts to raise bids. Some bitter people bid just to avoid a low sale of an item they just bought for more and never buys the item, so the auction is redone. I hate reserve pricing; a buy now price of $1000, a reserve of $900 and the bid starts at $0.99. eBay has room to improve in other ways too. I'm tired of going in a specific section like ""Game consoles"" and finding hundreds of listings for case and skins for game devices- these are and should be in ""Game Accessories"". Overall, the only issue I have with eBay at the moment is the Global Shipping Program. It maybe worth it to sellers but that program charges additional fees and duties that International countries (like mine) do not accept. Thus, as a buyer- I generally avoid global shipping sellers.",4,ebay.com
1370,"The folks down at eBay work hard at what they do and they do it well. The maintenance of the site is always done well to support a wide variety of browsing experiences; from Mobile Web to the latest version of polished chrome, I am never dissappointed by it's fresh looks. When it comes to actual purchases eBay can be a very customer friendly experience both for the buyer and the seller, However, as you may have guessed, It can also feel like one of the worst desicions of your life. Let's be real; bad things happen, but when they do happen you can be sure PayPal and or eBay will go out of their way to help make it right. On many occasions I have had sellers make stupid choices (Putting an iPad in a flimsy bubble wrap pouch...) After a quick contact with eBay or the seller I have always been reimbursed for damages to purchased products. As for the customer service? Well, it's off-shore that's for sure. Not much more I can say about that; Just expect a typical foreign customer service representative.",4,ebay.com

If you want to give your items away, this is a good place to start, scammers will take your money and your item and ebay will back them up. Used to be a great place to sell and buy, now the only thing you are doing is wasting your time and effort for the VERY few sales you will receive if you are not hidden by ebay. Not a fun place and I know why the sellers are leaving, all for the same reasons. No trust in the site, no customer service, scammers abound, ebay has become an awful place to try and sell any type of product, the small sellers can not compete with the Big Box Stores and the Foreign sellers. Had to find a new place and I did.....ebid.net....a great place to be...try it, you will like it.",4,ebay.com
1373,"First see feedback of seller, then buy. Paypal didn't defend you as you wish, for minimum you waste time about waiting of refund. So, as I say, first check feedback. Lots of stuff on ebay by cheap price, but lots of fraud sellers. Keep attention! More saving on auctions.",4,ebay.com
1374,"All in all EBay is a great website for buying or selling average to new quality items.. I wouldn't suggest selling tat or rubbish, as EBay always side with the buyer - under the money back guarantee.  That would be the only thing EBay should change the bias attitude as they always take the side of the buyer no matter how odd the case is!  I've sold over 65 things on EBay and not really had any problems other than some buyers having unrealistic expectations when buying one of my used products.  I'd definitely give EBay a chance, but be prepared for a few set backs if your a seller. If your interested in joining EBay as a buyer then its 5* as you either get the item or you get your money back, if your not happy with the description you get your money back or if your 100% happy with everything you usually get a really good value bargain.

1381,"I use ebay to mainly buy clothes, wigs, accessories and collectibles so I only have experience from those kind of sellers. My purchase went really well and that is probably thanks to my 'ebay routines'. I always check the bad ratings of the seller first. Why? Sometimes a seller may have a loooot of good ratings so that the bad ones disappear in the crowd. Look them up, read why they were unhappy with the purchase and then consider if you still can trust the seller. Maybe it was just a problem with longer waiting time for a customer or it could be something more serious that you are scared of happening to you.  I also have my own principle when purchasing anything on ebay: never buy expensive things. Why? actually it LIMITS the chances of me being scammed of a ton of money for possible $#*!. Also, I am on the internet to find lower prices, not higher than in stores. Then of course, if it is ridiculously cheap then always consider why that can be the case.  Lastly, if it is something that has a high risk of being fake (collector's objects or alike), then it is good to try and contact the seller for more pictures. If you get no answer maybe he is unavailable or just ignores it all together for reasons we fear. If he agrees it is good if you ask the seller to put something in the picture that normally would not be included so you know that the picture is genuine. Maybe a bottle or a cup, an item everyone has but would not normally be included in photos on the internet so that he can just copy it and send it to you. Sometimes we can get into contact with scumbags on ebay. But several times it is just a seller who wants to sell GOOD items and get nice reviews to help his business further.",4,ebay.com

I love buying on ebay because anything you buy is guaranteed for 45 days when you pay with Paypal so it is hard to go wrong. At the same time you can imagine what sellers have to do with scamming buyers who know this and use the guarantee to their advantage.

1396,"There are some keys to using EBay: 1. If you bid, make sure your payment is made according to seller's terms (e.g., some quire PayPal). 2. Don't be seducd by low price excluding Shipping, unless it says Free Shipping, which is the current craze that's continuing to blow up online shopping. Also, if Shipping details are omitted, move on (only buy from up-front sellers). 3. Most unsuccessful buys can be traced to poor communication. If the listing (esp. the Full Description page) is vague, maybe they don't really have the item(s). I've made roughly 100 purchases and never got shafted. I read carefully and don't buy when it seems overhyped or overpriced for what it is (except once I overpaid on a whim, my bad). All in all I'm happy wth EBay. I still hate how hard it is to recover a password, which happens about yearly for me (and that I can't keep one good secure password forever, or re-use my old ones). Sellers have been pretty accommodating. I've only had two or three returns. The worst part is when there is a dispute (which I had to initiate twice). Those always took months to resolve, no matter what. eBay is very hush-hush about those! Odd. I also dislike how slowly/never my failed transactions (okay there were just a couple of them, but they were distracting) finally disappeared from my lists. I had to request a couple of cancels for good reasons. Sellers agreed right away, but EBay was like, ""Oh, big no-no!"" That part feels like they are greedy and have no good-customer loyalty. 4. There is a well-worked-over process in place for returns, and it must be followed to the letter, so buyer beware if the seller looks inexperienced, there could be a bad outcome. Like buying anywhere, use your brain and you'll be fine.",4,ebay.com

1402,"I been with Ebay for 3 years now as a buyer. My advice as a buyer, and as a seller too, would be to do your homework on the person you want to bid or buy from, sell to.. By what I mean by homework is, look at percentage number next to there name, this tells you out of 100 percent what they measure up to. Look at what other customers say about them.

1425,"I love Ebay. The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because you have to know what to watch out for - you can run into a bad apple once in awhile but Ebay has a pretty solid system if you know how to use it to protect yourself. Here are a few valuable tips.  As a buyer - check seller 'feedback', (top right hand corner next to the seller name, number next the stars). This is how many people have purchased items from them. You are usually safe if they have lots of feedback. But read the negative reviews if you are buying jewelry, expensive items. Only a few people are diligent enough to discover 'fakes' or ""knock-offs'. Also check their seller history and past seller ID's. Sometimes it takes awhile for sellers to get caught selling fakes, etc. so they just change their seller name and start a whole NEW account until they get discovered again then start new again until caught again. But Ebay is usually pretty good about keeping history so unless they change banking info, etc. you will find them under 'seller history'.  You can usually get better deals if you buy from an individual rather than a full time seller so if little feedback, just make sure to stay on top of 'buyer protection' deadlines and policies so if you get burned, you can get your money back from Ebay. Just because it's a local seller, don't be fooled. Sometimes they buy the fakes from the Chinese or international sellers and resell them under the guise of being local. Check the sellers buying history or feedback as a buyer. You can usually see where they buy from if you investigate their feedback carefully.  Read each sellers policy. Some won't pay for return shipping if they sell you a bad item so then make sure to open up a case with Ebay through the resolution center rather than just working with the seller because if it's fake or 'not as described', Ebay will make them pay for the shipping. I usually open a case if I'm returning to make sure they don't say ""I never got it"" if I send it back. With an open case, Ebay monitors the tracking number so they can't do that and monitor it and have control over the sellers banking and Ebay returns your money, not the seller. If bidding, make sure to put your real top dollar price in at the end if the item is super low priced. Sometimes sellers have someone bid on it at the last minute if it is too low or a buyer is waiting on the sidelines to outbid you and you could miss out if you really want it.  Shipping is usually faster than promised. Always add insurance on valuables because sellers can say they sent it, send an empty box, etc. and you can open a case but it can be 'your word against theirs' if the seller has a tracking number. Established sellers won't usually do this but you never know if it's really valuable because one bad feedback won't hurt their score much. You can get great deals on Ebay but if it's too good to be true, remember, you are dealing with the public.",4,ebay.com

1433,"I've been shopping on ebay for maybe 7 or 8 years, mostly for vintage/pre-owned clothing and shoes and bike parts. I've purchased a few other random things as well.  Overall, my transactions have been positive: I've only had a few items that were either in poor condition or not as described. For items where size and condition really matters, I ask sellers questions before making a purchase - generally, they are happy to respond and do so within a day or two.  For the most part, my purchases have arrived quickly - including a dress from the UK and some hardware from Canada! (I'm in the US.)",4,ebay.com
1434,"I shop on Ebay for more than 10 years and i can hardly recall any cases when i was unsatisfied. Quality of the sellers is high, there is a claim process in case of any problems and support team works quite fast. But from my point of view - the prices are higher then on aliexpress or dealextreme. Of course it's not right to simply compare those marketplaces, but 50% of ebay sellers sell the same things as on aliexpress. Or they just drop ship. In order to pick the right product among hundreds of choices i used to read reviews on http://skuguru.com There are sections related to ebay, aliexpress and other internet shops.",4,ebay.com

There's very little about this site that I dislike but one is when you bid on an item it often takes some time to update so you don't know if your the highest bidder especially if there's only a few minutes left on an item. When I was offered to write a review by bzzagentuk I was very happy to. I have had very good experience from using eBay.

1445,"I give ebay a 4 stars because I am primarily a buyer and about 95% of my purchases turned out to be suitable. IF they are not, I can usually work it out with the seller without filing a complaint. There was only one abusive seller who wrote abusive emails. As a seller, ebay only gets two stars. I have very limited experience selling on line but my experience selling on ebay is only 50% good. And most of what I sell on ebay are itms I purchased on ebay. The first time, ebay removed a product from the listing after only one bid and the product reappeared one hour before bidding was over. Customer service could not find the listing and said that I must have removed it myself. Thankfully, the buyer understood.  A second time, ebay restricted my account so I could not access my account at all. When I reached customer service (2 days), I was told that there was no reason for it so they re-instituted it. A third time, ebay removed one listing saying I violated MC999 policy after there were already bids on the item. However, I did not violate the policy. I was told that I would be provided information on how to provide proof by a lady named Gel but never got the info. I called 4 days later and finally received the info. It is terrible that a specialist can act first without giving the seller a chance to show that their suspicion was incorrect. What was worse was that there were at least 30 other similar items being sold on ebay and some of them were counterfeit. Fourthly, if you are not a top rated seller, your listing appears at the very bottom of a long list. Sometimes, you cannot even find your listing at all. I have searched my listing using the lowest or highest price function. In both searches, my item appeared at the bottom of the list even though it was not the highest or the lowest priced. For some of what I offer, my items never appear on any searches. Therefore, I think ebay searches are somehow set up to favor their Top rate plus sellers, the ones who garner ebay the most money. Lastly, a buyer filed a not as described complaint. I wss willing to give a full refund AFTER the buyer returned the product. Ebay provided a continue button for me to proceed with my response stating that the continue button signifies that I was willing to give a refund. However, ebay did not indicate that clicking the button meant instantaneous refund. So now I am out the money and restitution is dependent on the honesty of the buyer. All of the above happened in my 4 month experience as a seller, I wrote the CEO, John Donahoe, who never responded. I guess the buck does not stop with ebay's CEO.  When I had problems with several online purchases at Home Depot and wrote the CEO, I got an email back within 12 hours. A specialist was assigned to help me and all my issues were resolved in one week. Home Depot's CEO does take full responsibility for that reason Home Depot will always get my business first as long as the value us there.",4,ebay.com

1447,Im and Ebay seller. And I absolutely love this site. Only thing I dont like about it is some sellers can be dishonest about a product there selling like fake phones trying to pass it off as a real one. Be careful when purchasing high priced items! And buyers can be just as bad... ebay is more on buyer side then seller side... a buyer can be greedy and want a refund for a merch they purchased which is in perfect condition and whats described and ruin a sellers rep at a drop of a hat. and ebay gives no f@#ks. I only sale new items and i check them before i ship out just to be sure.... I re-frame from selling used items and auction i tend to stay away from also. beeee careful when selling also.,4,ebay.com

1451,"I have been receiving occasional invites to the fairly new Coach online store located inside the Ebay web site. You do have to have an invite to get on the website, which I can't figure out. But when I have shopped on there, I have gotten really good deals on all kinds of Coach purses, cosmetic bags, wallets, key rings, lanyards, etc. etc. And they are the real deal. Most of their bags, even when heavily discounted, run about $90 and up, unless you get a swingpack purse (little tiny purse). I have purchased probably 10 handbags on there, both for myself and gifts, and only had to return two, as one was too big and one was too small. No problem with the returns, either. The quality is there, and there is a multitude of choices from sunglasses to jewelry to clothes. I have to restrain myself every time I get one of these invitations because I love my Coach handbags so much - and I want MORE! Items are paid for securely, shipped promptly from Coach, and are packed carefully, complete with the Coach care cards and the little tags that set off the alarm systems in stores if you don't get all of them out of your new Coach item!

1453,"Your ebay experience obviously depends on the seller. I've been using them for about 10 years, and this is the advice that I'd give: Only buy from someone with 100% positive feedback. The best ones have between 50-1000 reviews, because they will bend over backwards to protect their rep. You may think your safe buying from someone with 99.8 positive feedback with 50,000 reviews, but your negative is just a drop in the bucket to them. Use paypal, but also use a credit card with a customer friendly charge back policy. If something goes wrong, you have multiple options for disputing the charge.",4,ebay.com

E-Bay has a feedback system that I highly recommend any prospective customer to review before placing a bid or hitting the buy now button. PayPal is now the only form of payment accepted on E-Bay, it offers good buyer protection for online purchases. Now back to shopping...I can honestly say that I have yet to purchase any authentic Chanel items on E-Bay. The sellers list their items as authentic and promise the buyer that they're honest sellers and would never buy or sell a replica item. I've even had a seller tell me that a Chanel bag I purchased was confirmed authentic by MyPoupette.com (an online company that authenticates Chanel bags for a fee). You've guessed it, the bag is a fake. Don't be fooled by Chanel bags being advertised as vintage or rare bags because they too are most likely fakes. My suggestion to all designer bag fashionistas, if you truly desire an authentic designer handbag, only purchase one at an authorized dealer or a Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Hermes, etc. Boutique. Also, remember the golden shopper's rule, read the seller's feedback section, it is there to both inform and protect you the consumer. On the bright side, E-Bay has just about everything under the sun, so if you're looking for a hard to find item, E-Bay probably has it and several of them at a range of prices.

OVERALL, I love ebay, it's useful for about everything, it's pretty much safe when you purchase things, and you can find good deals. (: <3",4,ebay.com
1523,"Not bad, but fees are high.  You can easily make a living selling the right things.",4,ebay.com
1524,good site for purchase of different electronic products. one can compare an item with many many others and finally take a call.,4,ebay.com
1525,"<<< Avid Ebayer. At one time I thought of looking for an ""Addicted to Ebay"" group.... Anyhoo, I love it. I've been using it for a couple of years and I only suggest others pay attention to feedback scores, where it ships from and do a little more research; be patient - the item just might be a bit less the next week!",4,ebay.com
1526,Ebay is the best AND the worst thing ever. Best: You can shop and have great deals worldwide. Worst : There are scammers in buyers and sellers. Last advice: Get the best of ebay....always check before bid/buy and please do not have the same password for ebay and paypal accounts.... Please -no vote- thanks,4,ebay.com
1527,no problems,4,ebay.com
1528,"I've been a constant user of eBay - both as a seller and buyer and having said that, let's look at why I didn't give them a 4-star rating: 1. eBay is the land of fees. If they can find a way to charge you a fee for it, they will. I'm kind of surprised they don't charge a ""log-in"" fee for every time you sign in. Maybe they just haven't thought of it yet. 2. If you're selling, don't sell things overseas! The only items I've ever had that have supposedly gotten lost have been items shipped overseas - and I question whether or not they were really lost - and those have all been $50+ items. Hmmmm 3. As a rule, if someone has a low feedback rating (less than 100), it's probably best to steer clear of them for bigger ticket items, but give them a chance - everybody started out with a 0 rating at one time or another. Just order a small items initially and see how they perform. The seller will appreciate it and you might find someone you want to deal with again in the future. Overall, no real problems with eBay other than the overseas sales and the fees - they really do need to cut down on those!",4,ebay.com
1529,"I've never had any problem with any of my orders but always remember to pick sellers with good reputation, read the reviews and use paypal as payment method.",4,ebay.com
1530,"eBay is the original online auction site, its tuff to be a seller now because of all the fees but I have always had a good experience buying.",4,ebay.com
1531,"On eBay I was able to purchase items not found anywhere else. For example, a radio/cassette player for a 15 year old car. I was able to contact the dealer, who wanted over $300 for a replacement radio for my car.  I was able to purchase a refurbished radio/cassette player from eBay for $35. I paid $20 to have it installed in my car. Other than not having a light, it's still working great after almost 5 years.",4,ebay.com
1532,"Ebay is really good for buyers, but I think it's a little unfair to its sellers. I was looking into buying a certain product and found a really affordable seller, however when I looked into the seller before I made my purchase, I noticed that their review wasn't fully 100%. One of the people who gave them a negative review really seemed almost vindictive and mean, and it went against a lot of the other good reviews. Thank God I overlooked that review! I purchased my product from them anyways and honestly, I couldn't understand that one negative review! But poor company! Their rating got knocked so much! And it seemed so unfair!  So I think its reallyyyy convenient and awesome for buyers, but sellers beware!!",4,ebay.com
1533,ebay is not as good as Amazon is.,4,ebay.com
1534,"eBay gets a Meh from the seller side, but heart from the buyer side... Fees then fees then more fees.  For selling: Pros: Tons of buyers use eBay, and the messaging system is very helpful and useful. Cons: Fee to list your item, Fee when you sell your item, then another fee from your profits when you receive payment on paypal. Selling high priced items have entirely too high of fees. To sell a camcorder, I had to pay over $70 in fees + paypal fees. Buying: Tons of sellers mean that they fight for lowest prices. very possible to get really good deals in auctions. Cons: A LOT of Chinese knockoffs make it hard to find authentic items especially on clothing and sports merchandise.",4,ebay.com
1535,"I've bought a few books - received them in the conditions the sellers described and am quite fond of them. In trying to build up a collection of artbooks, for example, you can often find them in good condition on here without having to shell out 2x the price for new. I think the important thing to note is to look at the sellers' feedback and %, just like eBay or the sellers on Amazon.",4,ebay.com
1536,"I'll admit it - I use Ebay to buy strawberry shortcake figurines, my collector's item of choice. It's my little secret that's not so much a secret anymore. Anyway, I can't find a better place, other than a little store I used to frequent in Austin called Kids & Cats, than Ebay to get these items. And I think because not a lot of people are into Strawberry Shortcake, I get the good deals.",4,ebay.com
1537,"I've purchased a few things on ebay.com and out of all the experiences, have only had 2 bad ones. Once I bought a computer, which the seller completely lied about the os that was installed, ram, etc. (Finally resolved but I lost $60 in the deal). Once I ordered a software upgrade and the seller claimed ""We're out of what you ordered so we sent you this instead"" (Meanwhile they sold 8 more of what they were ""out of"", while I was getting my dispute resolved) I now will order from ebay but I set myself a limit, $25. The amount one could easily blow going out to eat or to the movies. That way, if the deal goes south; I just ""watched a lousy movie"". I recommend ebay.com because you CAN find some unusual and interesting items there, that you may not be able to find elsewhere. I haven't sold anything on ebay (though I have taken things to an ebay store where they sold them.) Therefore, I can't comment on the selling aspect of the site. Use it, but be cautious.",4,ebay.com
1538,"First of all, I have never been ripped off by a seller on ebay in the 10 years that I have been using it. My issue is with the ghost bidders, you know, those names that have a letter, ****, then letter. I avoid those sellers every time and look for honest to goodness humans auctioning/selling a product with real people bidding/buying.",4,ebay.com
1539,"you half to watch out for what iteams you bid on, but if its not too good to be true then its real, but if you think you can get 20 bare escentuals eye shadows for $15, then its not the real thing.",4,ebay.com
1540,"Lets face it, eBay is the world's flee-market! They don't like to think of themselves this way but it is true. Think about it... You can find almost anything you are looking for and most of the time a lot less.  About 6 months ago, we needed a part for our home heating system. The part was about $199.00 locally. We found it on the web for $119.00 and was about to purchase it (thinking we were saving $80 bucks!) when I decided to check eBay. eBay had one for $36.00 and another for $17.95!! A savings of $182.00 over what I found locally. Also found a new A/C compress for my truck for $80.00 when Autozone wanted $249.00.   How can anyone not like eBay? I have never been let down as a buyer of ebay items however, as a seller, we have had our share of ""problem customers"" because they do not read the complete description in the ad.   The only problem I have with eBay itself, is once you get use to it and how it works they change something! They use to show the bidder's user name. I could watch that name to see if it was a fake ad or a shill bidder. You can't do that anymore since they no longer display the bidder's user name (they do show it to you if your are the seller of the item).   Anyway, just remember to read the complete item description and if you see a $1000.00 item getting ready to sell for $25.00, be afraid, very afraid... It's a scam item and they want you to send them money using Western Union (which eBay advises against...) or to PayPal them to a different email address. Hackers do this because they have hijacked someone sellers account and need you to send the money to a different PayPal account - not the hijacked account's Paypal account.   Good Luck and Happy Bidding!",4,ebay.com
1541,"No fee for buyers. Fees are for sellers. I'm an occasional seller, so I wait for Ebay's promotion of ""free"" auctions, and only then do I list for no fee. I still pay Paypal fees, but that's okay. This auction site is better than Quibids.",4,ebay.com
1542,Ebay is definately better tha QuiBids - stay away from quibids (see my review).,4,ebay.com
1543,Know ahead of time the highest bid you would place and then forget it. Your other choice is to sit in front of the computer and get caught up in the excitement of bidding and end up paying more than you intended.,4,ebay.com
1544,"nice website, really good stuff, pretty much anything you wanna buy and you can also sell too!",4,ebay.com
1545,I was a faithful user of ebay for many years and never had any problems with them until they started changing everything. I had always sold handbags (authentic) had 100% feedback from all my customers and then they started removing my listings and eventually suspended my account. When I asked then why they said someone reported me for selling fake bags. Now seeing as how I have 100% feedbag from more then 700 satisfied customers I was outraged. And there is nothing I can do about it.,4,ebay.com
1546,Ebay is a far more reputable and trustworthy site than iOffer!!!,4,ebay.com
1547,"As a 11 year veteran of the site, I have noticed that over the past several years the site has leaned to the direction of the buyer in all aspects, this has made it difficult for alot of sellers to maintain their same business(some buyers are out there to take advantage of you) but ultimately the more accountable that you hold the sellers, the more comfortable the buyers will be. I don't agree with some of the politically driven policies, nor with the way ebay protects itself, but over all, thumbs up. No where else can you sell to the same size of audience, as you can on ebay.",4,ebay.com
1548,Ebay has always been my top site to look for hard-to-finds. But it's very complicated and discouraging to sell- policies are extremely unfavorable to sellers. But I must admit it's definitely a place with plenty of surprising great deals for buyers.,4,ebay.com
1549,"eBay is a buyers best friend. They will protect you and refund if you use PayPal. As a seller, there is no way to leave negative feedback for a bad buyer. (look at feedback left for others on a buyers page) The selling fees average over 10% plus 2.5% PayPal but still less than overhead of a physical store. Top Rated Sell designation levels the playing field for all sellers and is impossible to have if your aren't totally commited to accurate descriptions, good communication and fast shipping. It can be like walking on egg shells at times but still the best game in town.",4,ebay.com

Can't say I have always loved Paypal but the neutral party with your money is nice to have as a buyer or seller. Read the ratings of the buyers and sellers. Read the fine print. Insure your packages. Ask all the questions you have before the auction ends. I am hooked, and though we have an occasional dry spell.... ebay patiently waits for you to return. I give them a 4 out of 5 star rating.",4,ebay.com

I would have to say this much you really have to do your research before you get something from there. There are scammers on there sometimes. I have notified ebay about the sellers but all they ever say is they can't do anything about it. I, as a buyer should know better and should look into details before hand. Do watch out for that. Ebay doesn't really take sides. My overall experience has been pleasant with ebay. I been scammed couple of times but I took it up to paypal to get my money back, and they got me my money back. Ebay and paypal both do a great job at making sure that its users get a great experience out of it.

1557,Ebay is one of the most useful deal finders out there. There is so much selection you can spend hours browsing and you won't get bored. There are many good deals and most things have a protection policy. The reason it is cool instead of heart is because there is a small chance you will get ripped of and need your money back. Also be careful not to over bid.,4,ebay.com

1561,"I like eBay for shopping purposes and I can often find great deals. I have had problems when selling though, such as with feedback. If someone pays $3 for regular shipping, they give a 1 or 2 star rating on cost of shipping or if shipping takes one week (delays in Canada Postal services), then you get bad ratings, even though you have NO CONTROL over these issues. EBay should really change their policies because if (happened to me) someone buys two items from you and then thinks $4 is too much to pay for shipping from Canada to the US and it takes 10 days regular mail, giving you 1 and 2 star DSR, your account is restricted (when you get 2 one and two star ratings for one of the four DSR categories and you'll be unable to sell further items until the month passes and the bad ratings are ""knocked off"". To those people who do give bad ratings, it makes you want to ask them... WHY DID YOU PURCHASE from me if you think the shipping is TOO EXPENSIVE? I also get annoyed with the constant emails and papers from sellers demanding all 5-star ratings. I am slowly buying from other sites online for dvds, cds, etc. because I know I won't be harrassed to give positive feedback, even if I did not receive the right item, a damaged item, and have been refunded.",4,ebay.com

I used to sell a lot on the site, but then they came of with this lame 5 star rating system, and if you get a 4 (good service) star average you can't sell. IT is really stupid, since a 3 star rating is satisfactory. The buyer doesn't know that anything less the 5 stars is bad for the seller. From a buying stand point, I have been very satisfied 98% of the time, and like the buying experience on eBay.",4,ebay.com
1566,"You can find some attractive bargains on Ebay, but too often they will end up in a quite normal price (after I read the top comment, I knew that there were some tricky sniping programs, no wonder it's hard to win those attractive bids). However I am quite pleased with their buyers' feedback section, which is a track record of the seller's performance in the previous transactions. I feel safe to buy from those sellers with most positive feedback.",4,ebay.com
1567,"I'm a sporadic user of Ebay but my wife has been buying from it for at least ten years (somebody stop her, please? LOL) and has had no bad deals that I know of in all that time. I got into it I think about 8 years ago and it's changed a lot since then. It's opened the doors to professional dealers of varying trustworthiness, it's acquired PayPal and Skype, it's changed it's rating scheme to make buyers look better and sellers look worse, it's invented Ebay stores and Buy It Now, both fixed price transactions, and it's continuously messed around with the design of members' home pages in an ongoing attempt to make them as unhelpful as possible. The site itself has got gradually more slow-loading over the years too, as more and more Flash and interactivity has been deployed. Currently the front page is trying to be ""Web 2.0"" by having a word cloud, which slows the page down a bit and really isn't serving any useful purpose at all.  I've mainly been a buyer rather than a seller. I've sold maybe a dozen things and bought maybe a hundred. All my transactions went fine and I had no PayPal problems. I understand this is not everyone's experience. I've always paid promptly and have a 100% rating as a buyer (though this is easier to get now than before). I do enjoy the excitement of the chase in those last few seconds, and if I can manually ""snipe"" a bid in at the very last moment and win a great deal, it's a great experience. Sadly, people now deploy sniping programs, ""bots"" that bid for them in that vital last moment and can monitor and bid in multiple auctions simultaneously. Not cheating, but not fair either. Whatever you're looking for, Ebay is like a landfill, everything ends up there sooner or later. If you think of it just like a physical auction, and remember the golden rules of physical auctions - Only bring as much money as you can afford to waste, and keep your hands in your pockets unless you really mean to bid - then you should generally be OK. Never, ever assume that anything cheaply sold is anything other than cheaply made. If it's priced like a fake, it's a fake. If you don't know how to tell, walk away. Personally I wouldn't buy anything very large or very valuable this way unless it was specialized enough to be of little interest to your average second-hand junk dealer and the seller was knowledgeable enough to answer questions accurately. Though of course people routinely do, up to and including used fire engines and the occasional submarine. I just don't play in that league. You're well advised to take with the proverbial pinch of salt anyone who says ""I don't know anything about these"". That's potentially a dealer who bought the item at either a local auction, estate sale or even thrift store precisely because she knew *everything* about these. People commonly use such expressions to distance themselves from an item, and sometimes in the hope that you'll bite only because you think you've found a bargain that the seller doesn't know about. Volumes - literally - have been written about trading on Ebay and the temptation is to write another one, because the subject is so complex. Commonsense will take care of many of your concerns, though, and the strength to walk away from a deal you're not too sure of.  What's missing here is the sellers' points of view. Hopefully we can get some regular sellers to tell us about their experiences with Ebay as well, because buying is only half the story.",4,ebay.com
1568,"I really enjoyed my recent experience with Ebay. I had heard so much about Ebay that I went online , looked around for a while, and then decided to purchase a Dell laptop computer for my son, who was starting in college. I was realy excited about the ""great deal"" I got -a ""slightly used, working"" Dell for $284 with Windows XP, WiFi, etc. Imagine my horror..when my ""great deal"" turned out to be an old beat up computer with a burned out screen!! After multiple unsuccessful attempts to resolve the issue with the computer company, Ebay stepped in and within 72 hours, had issued me a full refund plus shipping costs AND told me to keep the Dell laptop computer for scrap parts!!",4,ebay.com
1569,"Really like the site up to a certain point. You will find pretty much anything at this place, the only I don't like is you can't really know if you're buying exactly what you're buying. Yea, the feedback system is a good thing but sometimes people that review it doesn't seem to know the stuff they got aren't exactly what they're looking for. Each person's standard's different. I buy games here and two sellers can have games listed as New but one came with it shrink wrap but when I open it you can tell it's been used via scratches and booklet having some kind of color stain. Yet the other one came non shrink wrapped, claiming it was opened to check it works, and the disc was perfect with no scratches, perfect booklet and even came with the ad inserts that usually comes with games now.

It's impossible to disginguish new stuff from used stuff, even though that's what the user wants an what eBay can easily facilitate if it listened or cared.  The My Ebay page is a disaster - a confoluted quagmire that tells me everything but what I want to know.  Still a good place to shop for records, especially rare and hard to find ones.

He then begged me not to leave bad feedback. And he asked me to send him pictures so I did just that. I sent him several pictures. He proceeded to call me a liar and a scammer and something about faking pictures. Then he said after doing a forensic investigation that the jeans weren't the same jeans he sent and even the coloring was different. He is so full of it the pants are the ones he sent. I don't even have another pair of that style. I have a pair of the $#*!ies Flex and several pairs of the duck pants that come in 3 different colors. Brown, Black, Green. The ones I ordered from pierregolfmanstore the con-artist are Blue. He was upset because his 100% customer satisfaction rating was being tarnished. Because I told him I didn't want a $22 refund that would cost me more than that in my time and then having to buy gas for someone else and pay them for their time to run me around to find someone to print the return shipping label and then having to find someone to print out a label for me plus having to pay someone for their time and gas to take me to the Post Office to mail the jeans back out. I think little French Pierre is a peter puffer. I am posting this to warn everyone to avoid him and his items that he has for sale on EBay. He is a crook.

1602,"I have been a user since 2006 and i am a shopoholic on ebay. theres only been 2 items that i never recieved out of the hundreds of items that i bought over the years using ebay. I received a full refund for the 2 items lost. I have sold hundreds of items on ebay as well and every customer loved my listing presentations. All though i will say that i dont like how ebay limits you to 12 pictures per listing and i cannot provide more pictures to be detailed descriptive to the customer. And ATTENTION to ebay sellers, when listing fragile or collapsable items, please use bubble wrap or foam peanuts and put them in the appropriate size box to prevent damage to the item. I had received a boxed action figure that had been damaged due to poor packaging. Do not cut corners and leave out the bubble wrap. if you cannot find the appropriate size box then make one from recycled cardboard. You can get lots of cardboard from any business that recycles. ATTENTION to ebay buyers when youre shopping and commit to buy always look at the sellers feedback before buying. Anything past 95% is good feedback. I recommend Paypal for your best transaction method. And look at the sellers location and time estimated of when your item is expected to arrive. If you have questions or concerns message the buyer/seller before you commit transactions and the response should be within 48 hours. Thank you for reading the reviews and enjoy your shopping experience on ebay.",5,ebay.com

Of all those total sales, only one transaction was an issue that required EBay's involvement. After investigation, EBay promptly refunded my purchase price because the Seller had 'disappeared' and wouldn't respond. This all happened within 5 days. I use PayPal so the money was returned to my account there. One other time, a small item wasn't delivered. I contacted the Seller by email (China) and they promptly re-sent another. It arrived on schedule...problem solved. Presently, I have another 5 'active' orders with 5 different Sellers and have complete confidence that everything will arrive as promised.

If I sell something on e-bay BE SURE TO TAKE DETAILED PICTURES OF IT IN EVERY WAY so in CASE you get something back that has been switched out, you can prove with your pictures that what you sent out was NOT what was returned. ALL-WAYS protect yourselves with pictures and proof because the scams out there are rampant and you don't want a bad experience as e-bay goes with who has more legitimate proof to prove the truth. Don't be lazy in buying or selling. Take lots of pictures, model numbers, all around, make notes and always have a USPS Tracking number to prove your integrity. Then you will be okay. E-bay cares. You just can't be careless if you want to be listened to and believed by e-bay. They deal with a lot of claims and scams.

I've had 2 situations that eBay decided in my favor: The buyer claimed they never received an item. eBay asked for my tracking number, which I provided, and within 2 days they decided in my favor. They do not allow the buyer to leave negative feedback in a situation like this. I sold an item and wasn't paid by the buyer. I did attempt to correspond several times with no answer. Again, EBay doesn't allow them to leave negative feedback even if the seller decided to.",5,ebay.com

1640,"I started visiting eBay when I wanted to replace my rented cable modem. By owning my own I would save $10.00/mo on my cable bill. I was going to buy the Arris gateway but it would have taken 2 years to break even. I noticed the exact cable modem I was renting was available for sale, but with one exception. They were all used. The one exception was a ""Lot of 7"" modems for around $500.00, so I decided to buy the seven, sell the six I didn't need on eBay and end up with my own for free. The plan was going so well I decided to buy another lot of seven, and then another. It was easy to get started selling and as the extra modems sold on eBay, I was actually doing quite well financially. However, suddenly the modems I had sold started coming back to me. Evidently the ISP didn't like having their branded devices owned by their customers instead of being rented to them. In the end I ended up refunding two-thirds of the sold modems, which was made easy with eBay and PayPal, and getting refunded myself for two of the three lots I had purchased, even though the seller was no longer an eBay member. eBay's return policy protected not only my buyers but me as well. Plus, I ended up with the Arris modem I had wanted in the first place from the profits on my non-returned devices. I also learned a lot and really appreciated the policies, assistance and help from eBay.",5,ebay.com

1643,"I love shopping on eBay because it's usually the cheapest place on the internet to buy whatever I want or need. I've bought over 100 items on eBay, and for the most part, I'm very glad I did because I'm sure I've saved 100's of dollars by doing so. Their selection is huge, and once you understand how everything works in their system, it should be an enjoyable shopping experience for you. I usually just pay the ""buy it now"" price for my item(s), but I've also won several auctions as the highest bidder on unique items, and also paid less by 'making an offer' to the seller when it's an option for the item (and the seller accepts my offer). I can't comment on selling anything on eBay, because I never have. Finally, I'm mostly satisfied with eBay's customer service/resolution department for any issues I've had. My only real complaint is that there are some seller's I've bought from on eBay that ended up being fictitious accounts (I never received the item I purchased). But because of eBay's guarantee, I was issued a full refund for my purchase price and shipping once the resolution department researched the issue and decided in my favor.",5,ebay.com

I ordered a special flour from Amazon which stated it would ship in 1 month. That month came, then 2 weeks later I got an email. Product would ship in one more month for 2 1/2 month total for waiting. Needless to say, I canceled the order. I am wise to shop at E bay, you would be too.",5,ebay.com

As, I thought I would leave some overdue feedback while I was there. Went back awhile later by typing Ebay into my browser. The website came up but my security said it was not a valid site and had an odd name on the certificate. So I closed and reopened my browser, typed in www.ebay.com and got to the real site. It looked almost identical to the scam website. Searched for that item and it was no where to be found. It was a scam add for a collectable that I know a lot about and I was going to report it. So be careful. Always type the full address in your browser. Don't rely on links nor the search list. I have never had a bad experience with Ebay, always positive. The sellers have always been top notch outside of a few slow shipment times.",5,ebay.com

1654,If you have a problem with a seller. Give eBay time to work on it they are very good about getting money back. I have not once had a problem. But my items are not $400 more like $50 $60. I just dealt with a company called concealed consignment they make holsters I sent the shipper a message I didn't like how tight it was on my firearm so I heated it up but too much heat melted the product. The seller said if I had a problem I should have contacted him in the first place. But I want to send you a replacement. I sent the seller a thank you message. He was so nice we clicked had a lot in common traded emails I talk to him all the time. I know they're all not like that but most of them are people just like me and you trying to make an extra dime. And bad reviews really hurt them so I'm surprised this person did not work with you. Or surprise eBay did not set in and collect your money. Or surprised PayPal did not step in. That's why I deal with eBay you are protected by two different companies PayPal and eBay split,5,ebay.com

It's not a perfect place all around, and it's strengths are definitely in it when it comes to buying and selling is a little more of a hassle and they take a decent chunk of money out of your revenue. But out of all the years I have used it, for probably every 20 or 30 items I've bought, I've sold one thing. When I consider all the great deals I've gotten on eBay, they regularly have much better deals than Amazon and whatever else I can find through Google shopping. Once in a while, I will check other websites and find they have better deals, but it is rare. Ebay is the way to go for getting consumer products for a fraction of the cost, and many sellers offer free shipping on their items. You rarely see that on Amazon unless you're a Prime member.",5,ebay.com

1673,"As a buyer only, I trust eBay more than almost any other secondhand website. The sellers here are more likely to post very clear pictures of their items and, in many cases, provide detailed descriptions as well. If I ask a seller a question about an item, I receive a response about 75% of the time, which is better than a lot of other platforms. The sellers ship on time, or let you know why they won't be.  Finally, the buyer protection is fantastic. If an item is not as described, you receive your money back + the cost of return shipping. If an item is never received, you receive your money back.

I incurred $100 trip charge paid to my installer who could not install due to missing regulator. After chasing the seller for over two weeks for partial refund (seller refused) and getting insulted by the seller, Ebay ruled in my favor that I get my full payment back and get to keep the cooktop.

The buyer could actually see the used item for sale functioning, in the video clip. This would work good for both buyer and seller. I think a lot of used consumer electronics, get dismissed due to age, how the item looks, etc.Or, some people are afraid to buy used. So a lot of used consumer electronics get looked over, because there is no way of proving the item actually works, without taking the sellers world for it.

Anyone who buys older videos games knows this is a huge issue. Due to my forgetfulness I missed the return by date and thought I was stuck with the game. EBay however decided to refund my money and did not require me to return the game! Simply wow!",5,ebay.com
1754,"Yeah, everybody knows about it, and many of us look there first for most everything on-line. I am no different. Great for craft items and bargain costume jewelry. I've had great prices on musical instruments, clothing from India and a lot more. The trick is to become an ebay-oholic and do heavy research, checking new sellers and used items for deals. But that can be dangerous if, like me, you can get carried away.  Unless something is truly unusual, don't buy from the first seller that offers it, especially from China. Also be aware of shipping fees which are not always obvious, especially if you have been looking at ""free shipping"" things for a while. Finally, some real deals can be had under ""ending soonest."" You might catch something others have missed. Again, when under a deadline, be sure to check shipping costs!  Feedback can be helpful, but eBay hassles sellers for good marks, who in turn hassle us, the buyers, albeit usually nicely.",5,ebay.com

1782,Awesome,5,ebay.com
1783,"I have yet to have a bad experience with Ebas customer service in regards to sellers. I have been duped when it came to sellers overseas that had a picture of item and when I received it looked nothing like the picture. Or when a seller lied and said they lived in California but they really lived in China and it took my order forever to show up, customer service has always made sure I got my money back. The second key is emailing the seller to show how you are communicating with them in attempts to get your money back. The extra documentation helps tremendously. I say this because once I tried communicating with a seller about refunding my money for shoes she sent with the stuffing coming out and she begged me to keep them and accept her discount. I said no and proceeded to return the shoes to China. She was upset and stop responding to my emails But I had taken pictures of the receipt and the money I paid to ship it back. I was charged for the shoes and shipping which came to 60.00. Thank God for Paypal. When Ebay couldn't get her to respond to them either they refunded all of my money which is why I will continue to use them when compared to Rosegal which is a complete ripoff.Some sellers use beautiful pictures of celebrities to sell items but only a few of them look like the actual item when you receive it. I will continue to use Ebay.",5,ebay.com

1802,"Love ebay, as a buyer...haven't tried selling, yet. The auctions are fun, if the wait is a bit frustrating at times. I've only had one bad seller there, all others have been great, especially when it comes to answering questions. As in all online sites you have to check on the seller reliability, that's what burned me when I first started buying...make to sure to check customer comments for each seller I buy from...Though this can be unreliable when it comes to the Chinese sellers. Personally, I don't buy from anyone with a rating below 99.0% rating and have only been burned once. Paying with Paypal has been great as I don't have to give any credit card info to each individual seller when making purchases. Hopefully I will still have this option when ebay and Paypal split. I've gone on to use Paypal when shopping other sites, keeping all of my credit card info private and in one place rather than spread out across the internet. You don't have to have a Paypal card to use Paypal... As far as Customer Service goes, The only problems I've had was in language and I requested, nicely, to have another representative with better English and everything was settled. I have always been treated with respect and my problems resolved within one phone call (1-866-540-3229, 5AM - 10PM PT, M-Sun). UPDATE: Just last month, Jan 2016, I was burned on a purchase from China. The seller expected to get favorable rating for item when 2 cords were missing. This is NOT ebay's fault but the seller. I got burned because I compromised on the 99% feedback rule I usually follow...this seller had 99.4%.  After reading some of the complaints I realized that many, not all, are blaming ebay alone for the sellers' ripping people off.  If buyers do their homework...check feedback and do Searches online for customer reviews of brands, there's less chance of being taken. Don't want to say ebay is perfect and always gets buyer's money returned, but it's ultimately up to the buyer for refunds. Too many complaints against a seller then ebay suspends them... Not sure how that works since not seller. Do remember that after the 30 days nothing will be done...you have contact the seller yourself....Been there, Done that and it doesn't work, at least for me.",5,ebay.com

1807,"I have been on eBay for over 9 years. Many of their selling policies have changed and they have to much to say about what one can sell. The fees are to high, so it makes it hard to give people a really good affordable price. A basic stores (9%) fees..that is insane + a shipping %..really now! Is it that serious...other selling platforms do not charge additional for shipping; so why should eBay.?....Oh! don't forget you still have to pay Paypal fees. (which I must say are very reasonable).I A seller has to really jack up their prices to make a decent net....So, personally I stay away from the auction because of this. eBay may have been the best selling platform in the beginning, but not so now. Controlling your business, what you say and how you advertise and communicate with your buyers. eBay.. Com'on really!... can't prevent communication. If my customer wants something that i am not listing... I am surely not going to post it just to make the sell. eBay wake up and get on board with other successful sites that have much better seller fees and exposure. So potential sellers...check out all the other options when you want to list....I waited years before I got on Etsy.. they are super..",5,ebay.com

On the whole I am happy with eBay and hope to do transactions for another 17 years.",5,ebay.com
1864,For what this site does it is probably as good as possible. It brings millions of sellers together with millions of buyers. This naturally creates a lot of potential problems and ebay handles this as good as I can imagine. The feedback on a seller/buyer is the key. For a seller with anything less than 100's of reviews or less than 98% positive feedback simply stay away.,5,ebay.com

I have already managed to buy a brand new addition for my beautiful growing coin collection and will continue collecting these beautiful items located on Ebay. Ebay is a very awesome site and I hope it stays up for a very long time :). Ebay and the Ebay Team you guys rock!",5,ebay.com
1871,"**PLEASE READ** If you are a buyer, eBay.com is a wonderful, cheap site to do your shopping and is very reliable. It is filled with many distributors that sell their products much cheaper than what you would pay in a store. At least, depending who you're buying from. It's one of the few sites I'll purchase from online. And here's why: I've purchased from eBay for years and all from different people and every time has been successful. The key to having a successful purchase is to read the ratings people have given the seller. This is shown beside the item's picture under the seller's name. If the seller is rated above 90% by many people (not just 1 or 2), you can assume it's safe to order from them. I suggest you scroll down where there's a page full of detailed information about the product (usually in bold, colourful font). There you will see information regarding the size of the item, the materials it's made of, the average time it takes for the product to arrive in different countries, and how to contact them if there's an issue. A good seller will always encourage you to contact them if there's a problem and they will gladly fix it for you. But, you'll probably never need to contact them. The item usually ships between 1-2 days business days after you pay for it. The seller will specify. It will take longer if you order an item that needs to be specially made. It took a little over a week for the seller to ship a costume she had designed for me. That's understandable. The item will usually arrive between the time frame the seller says. Note the ""usually"". It may take a few days more or a few days less. It is just an estimate. But it's usually pretty accurate. It has been for me anyways. I hope this has been helpful for you. You can trust eBay if you buy from them.",5,ebay.com

1941,"I do love ebay....I have been a happy member for years. I have had a few bad experiences with some people-browsers, buyers, and sellers-but there are lots of ways to protect you in place. I love used items- the best kind of recycling!:)",5,ebay.com
1942,"Is the world's biggest, longest-running garage sale, as well as its most extensive auction house. Buy, sell, browse, bid, and be amazed at what you find at this wonderful site!",5,ebay.com
1943,"I love shopping on Ebay.com! You can find so many unique things that you can't find anywhere else. Some that you need and some that you didn't know you needed until you discovered them! I've purchased 350+ items on Ebay.com and have only had two negative experiences.  Some tips for those new to purchasing on Ebay. You can bid on items or use the ""Buy it Now"" feature to purchase an item for the specified price. While it is exciting to bid on items, be careful that you don't get too caught in the excitement of winning that you end up spending more than you wanted to or get hooked on bidding on lots of different items. I did for awhile and found myself in debt so I learned my lesson. Just know your limits.  Always do your homework on the seller that you're thinking or purchasing an item from. Check their percentage score. The closer to 100% feedback the better. I won't touch anything under 90% and am even leary of those under 99% but that's just me. You also should look to see how many items the seller has sold as that does factor into how good or bad their score seems. If they haven't sold very many items and have a very low score that's a huge red flag while others that have sold thousands might not be as bad but still worth doing your homework. I always go to the seller profile an while it scrolls their most recent feedback, click on where it says to ""View all feedback"". You can then see how many good, neutral and bad reviews they've had for the last month, 6 months and 12 months. I often will scroll through many pages of feedback to find the neutral and mainly negative reviews to see why they received this feedback and then determine if I want to do business with them. Also if you find a seller that has sold very few items, look at the ebay id's that left feedback for them. If you see that there are many of the same ebay id leaving feedback, that could be friends of theirs building up their score to give you confidence in buying from them in hopes that you won't look at the id's. Early on when I started using Ebay I got bit by this very thing. They were a fraudulent seller and I never received my item and they closed their account! Overall Ebay is a great experience that I highly recommend, just do your homework to get the best experience. Happy shopping!  :)",5,ebay.com
1944,"I have had only good experiences using e-bay. Of course you have to be careful what you buy and read the sellers reviews and profile before you buy something. I have never had to return something, but I think the support would be there from ebay if I needed help.",5,ebay.com
1945,"I have used this site for years, and have had few problems. Purchases are easily completed and arrive quickly, and many of the sellers are very accomodating if you have problems with the purchases. I have also sold successfully on this site and had good customers.  In ten years, I've only used the dispute process three times, but found it to be very easy and obtained a refund with no problems though paypal. I love this site and will continue to use it for many years to come for all my online purchases. I have also successfully sold several used items on ebay and never had any problems from my buyers, although browsing the forums will turn up some horror stories about dishonest buyers. There is scamming on both sides of the deal, but most people who use ebay are honest and just looking for a fair deal for their money, which I try to provide. I'm not too into their new rules about waiting for your money until you can prove an item is delivered or 21 days, but using DC will help fix that problem.  I have also called their customer service and managed to get my problems taken care of quickly and with little problems. I like ebay, its all around a great site.",5,ebay.com
1946,"We have ordered from ebay for eons it seems. Very little problem, and when we did have a problem with a seller, Ebay has always stood by us. We have ordered everything from ink, computer, CDs, books, dresses, ties, to essential oils.",5,ebay.com
1947,"I have shopped on this site many times. It has never been a problem. Sometimes there are scams and rip offs so it's good to check the ratings, and the reviews. Read the description slowly and make sure you understand it. Communicate with the buyer. Try not to spend so much. Keep your self on a limit. So if you do get ripped off or scammed, it will be unfortunate but you wont lose as much money.",5,ebay.com
1948,I've used ebay many times for buying everything from xmas gifts to computers. I had some issues with the quality of goods a couple of times but each time I was able to find a way to solve problem peacefully. Ebay is a reliable site to buy things from.,5,ebay.com
1949,I think Ebay is a great site! The only thing you need to look out for are people trying to scam you. Make sure you fully read the description of the item and look at the sellers feedback. Sometimes sellers will put crazy shipping prices but I normally stay away from those,5,ebay.com

1953,"I am an ebay junkie, if I want it and can't find it on the internet shopping sites, I always head over to ebay, type in one or two words, hit FREE SHIPPING, and let the internet do its magic. I have been ebaying for 5 years just about, have my own jewelry line and do Digital Art and can find all and more products I need to be successful. I am an avid collector of rare and out of print books and only a few times could not find a copy of a jewel I really wanted to own. And did I mention the freedom and availability of Paypal??? That could be a whole new review....Just enough to say I adore Paypal and have never ever had a problem with ebay or its policies.  Last month I ordered a book and when it got here, it was the wrong book. Almost on the heels of the book came a e-note from the seller telling me he sent me the wrong book and the correct one was on its way and I could keep the mistake and our transaction wouldn't cost anything extra at all... I donated the book to our Library and the replacement was here in 5 days... Awesome site for me, if there were 10 stars available, I would light up all 10 M",5,ebay.com

1979,I just recently won an auction for a vintage Paul Revere whistling tea pot. It was a 6 cup size pot that was so cute. On both sides of the pot it had the Paul Revere signature. The bottom of the pot said 1801 made in Korea with the stamp of Paul Revers head on it. The bottom of the pot was made of chrome and copper clad bottom. This tea pot was so cute. The seller was so kind and sent all details about the pot. When it arrived it was almost in mint condition. There was just a small scratch on the top by the spout. The little tea pot is really cool. Things like this are only found on ebay. I lucked out getting such a nice item. They still have a few left but some are not in quite the same condition of the pot I won. I hope anyone who might want something vintage looks at ebay to find it. I will always love ebay,5,ebay.com

1992,"I've bought and sold on eBay for more than ten years. If you want to sell something online, it doesn't get any better than eBay. I like to think of it as an online garage sale. The advantage of selling on eBay over having a garage sale is exposure. Instead of having random people from a limited local area looking at what you are trying to sell, you get a nationwide, or worldwide, audience. And your auction listing will also get a targeted audience. For the most part, the people looking at the item you list are people who are interested in exactly what you are trying to sell. They had to search for your auction to find it. With a targeted nationwide audience, that item that you would be lucky to sell for $10 at a garge sale might now find buyers willing to pay many times more. You can make a greater profit when selling on eBay compared to selling through other common venues. As a buyer, sometimes eBay is the only place you would be able to find stuff. If you're looking for used, vintage, antique, collectable, rare, unique, one-of-a-kind items, eBay is still the best place on the internet to find them. Over the years, eBay has evolved into a marketing tool for sellers offering brand new products, and sometimes you can find good deals on those items too. I love eBay.",5,ebay.com

Ebay has great phone support, YOU CAN""T LOSE MONEY or get ripped off -- all you have to do is contact EBAY or PAYPAL and they IMMEDIATELY take your word and refund your money (unless you have bad feedback or something and call all the time LOL). Its friendly, personable, great prices, I am a seller AND a buyer and ALWAYS check ebay first when looking for something!",5,ebay.com
1995,"I think eBay is a tough site to rate because you are not buying from eBay, you are buying from the tens of thousands of buyers - some good - some not so good.  I think the only way you can rate the site is by how they deal with you as a customers if anything goes wrong and how user friendly the site is.  All in all the site is really good for both sellers and buyers buy unfortunately a playground for scammers - both buyers who say items haven't arrived when they more than likely have just to get a freebee or a refund and sellers who sell fake/dodgy items and do a runner with your money.",5,ebay.com

I'm not much of a seller though but more of a buyer. I just make sure that I read feedbacks from the seller and check if they are power sellers just to make sure of their credibility.

2004,"I have both bought and sold on ebay. Most of my experiences have been very positive. When buying an item, I have had a few issues with purchases but the issues were always resolved by ebay and my money was refunded as they do have buyer protection. I have also sold items on ebay. In a few instances as a seller, I have encountered buyers who don't honor their bid. Ebay has always credited my account for any fees that were taken.I guess the only complaint I have about ebay at this point is as a seller. Their fees have skyrocketed. It's almost not worth selling small ticket items because of this. If I was allowed to take away half a star for this I would, but you can't beat the great deals to be had when bidding on an item. Just be sure to research your sellers feedback before bidding (click on their score and read what buyers hve to say). Hope this helps.",5,ebay.com
2005,"From an ebay buyer's point of view... If you know what you're doing in e-bay (aware of ebay's terms and conditions, sellers feedbacks, sellers terms and conditions, the good ole fine print, ect) you'll do fine or even great in ebay. Everybody's protected in ebay, so if you want to buy something outside of ebay' terms, don't do it. If something goes wrong, you're on your own.

2017,Ebay is an excellent well put together site. There is a basic search engine on the home page and options to view various different categories. The users can sell or make bids for items and the site is constantly updated with new prices and new auctions. The site works very quickly considering there are around 100 million users. My only criticisms are :- It is difficult to get in touch with anyone to phone or speak to anyone. It is very addictive - its like having a shopping centre in your living room. As with any auction sites> They can attract scammers. However eBay takes security very seriously and transactions always require a secure server. Generally on the whole - Marvellous.,5,ebay.com
2018,"I started using ebay approximately 10 years ago as a buyer .. then as a seller. It's a good website ... I've got many good deals, few bad deals because I'm really picky 'trusting' my seller.  you need to do some research 'from whom' you're going to buy your item. if they have zero feedbacks and no history at all .. it's kinda risky to buy from that person. I like reading the seller ME page .. and see what they say about themselves.  Just be very careful and know when to stop bidding .. coz otherwise instead of saving money .. u'll end up losing money. ALSO .. know the 'retail price' first before thinking an item is CHEAP .. coz with all those bid war .. people forget that the item end up cheaper if you just go to the store and buy it there, they get caught up with the 'bidding war' and want to win the item so bad w/out thinking that the price starting to pass the 'retail price' ..",5,ebay.com

2022,"I've been a member of ebay for more than 10 years and I've managed to do very well in buying and selling on ebay. Sometimes the shipping charges are outrageous but shipping charges are posted by the sellers. I like the fact that we are buyer and seller protected but their charges to the seller are getting larger and larger as the years go by. The best way to pay or get paid with ebay is through pay pal but they also have charges to the seller.   One thing I would recommend is to not buy shoes on ebay. Usually they are seconds and don't fit correctly. Make sure, before you buy, to read each seller's feedback list. Sometimes it's worth it to spend a little extra on something that is listed by multiple sellers to know you are buying from a good and reputable seller. Just yesterday I had that choice and chose to spend an extra $10 on something because that particular seller had 100% positive feedback. All in all, my experience with ebay has been a good one.",5,ebay.com

I set up a $5.00 max on most itms, and if I really need/want/can use it, I bid aggressively. If it's something that's wholesale, other things WILL show up!

2034,"E-Bay.com is one of the best example of American ingenuity. It really creates a lot of jobs and makes buying and selling just a pleasure. In addition, customer support of E-Bay is extremely professional.",5,ebay.com
2035,"www.ebay.com can be a great place to shop for many things, including toys. I've recently started shopping for toys at www.ebay.com, so from what I'd like to share what I've learned as an amateur batty bidder to help you get started. When starting out on www.ebay.com, you'll want to link your account to a Paypal account. Most every transaction you make will be through Paypal, and you can either do instant bank transfers or pay by credit card. I would recommend paying by credit card, as that can add a thin layer of protection if a purchase should go awry. When shopping on ebay, you have to do a lot of research. For example, let's say you're shopping for a toy. First, you want to know every little thing about the toy. You want to know what the toy looks like, what the box art looks like, when it was issued, what it includes -- everything. When you're shopping on ebay you will be buying loose or sealed items, usually looking at user uploaded photos of the product should they be provided. You need to know exactly what you want so you can match them with the photos and their description. Now, let's say you've found your item. You want to look at several different things when evaluating the posted product: *The shipping and handling -- make sure the shipping cost is reasonable for the product. If it's ridiculously high, then it's highly suspicious. *The photos, if provided. Look at them closely if you're able to zoom in. Check to see if there's any damage to the toy. See if there's anything missing with the toy. *Read the description of the toy. Read it twice. If they mention any problems with your product, you may want to consider contacting the seller to get specifics. If they mention loose joints on an action figure, ask them which ones. If they mention scratched stickers or paint and you can't see them in the photo, contact them for more information. Do not be afraid to contact the seller and ask them questions! You're dealing with regular peeps on E-bay and not all of them have a professional portrayal of what they're selling. *Check the seller's feedback. When people make purchases or sell things, they can be left by feedback from other users. If the person has recent negative feedback or no feedback at all, you should avoid them. Now, there's a variety of things about bids and buying you should know about. I doubt I'll cover it all, but hopefully I can get the bread and butter out of the way for ya. There's two common ways to acquire something off of ebay. For one, there is the ""buy it now"" option, which is straightforward. By clicking on this option you commit to buying the product. It does not pay for it immediately. However, I recommend paying for your purchase, soon. And then there's the auction dealie. Ebay works by using incremental bidding. What does this mean? Since it isn't a live auction, per say, they conveniently have everyone place a ""max bid"". In other words, they place the maximum amount they're willing to bid during an auction. It will then place a bid in order to keep you at the top bid, while calculating everyone else's max bids. That is unless the bidding exceeds your max bid. For example, a ""Shiny-Thingy-Ma-Doo"" may be bidding at $0.99. You find yourself willing to pay $10.00, so you place that as your maximum bid. The bid then shoots up to $2.00 or what not -- it places a bid on your behalf in an increment to make you the top bidder. There is some beauty to this. Let's say the auction ends at $2.00 dollars, with you at the top bid. You'll only have to pay $2.00, and not the full $10.00 you placed as your max bid. When placing your max bid however, here's a tip. Don't make it an even, guessable number. You can lose a bid by a couple of cents! If you are willing to bay $10.00, make it $12.87 or some bizarre number. By adding a few dollars and cents, you increase the chances of winning a bid should no one's max exceed yours. A lame schmo might place $10.00, or a more clever schmo might place $11.90, but by adding those few radical dollars you've topped them all. Finally, let's talk about how to place a bid. There's the decried method of ""sniping"", which is manually or automatically placing your max bid in the last few moments of an auction. Sniping is a great, if not rueful method to win an auction. *It prevents people from increasing their max bid should yours top theirs. *It prevents a bid war from occurring -- people inflating the price as they bid back and forth over and item. *Fewer bids on an item means it has less attention. An item with lots of bids on it will attract more attention, which means more bidders and more money. To learn how to snipe I suggest you scour the interwebs for more guides. It can be done manually or with utilities. As for what utility I use to snipe, I recommend www.myibay.com . They can place bids for you without you having to be present. I've found them to be reliable. I invite more experienced ebayers to comment. I recommend reading up on more guides if you're new to ebay or toy shopping, just as well. But, I hope that this little guide can help you on your merry way to happy shopping on ebay -- for it's a great auction house indeed.",5,ebay.com

2038,"I shake my head when I read reviews from negative buyers ... READ the ad description..

2039,"As I Buyer, I give Ebay 5 Stars!!!! As a Seller...4. Ebay is a great site for great prices on everything and anything but just like others have said...READ THE FEEDBACK FIRST!!!! I do a lot of business on Ebay and I've never had a minor dispute that wasn't fully resolved with a seller in a short period of time. I never had a major dispute as a buyer or ANY dispute as a seller. Just read the descriptions and give accurate descriptions and Ebay will work out just great. The Seller fees are a little higher than I'd prefer but all and all I do thousands of dollars of purchasing and selling, I have 100% and I'm very thankful for Ebay!!!! My suggestion is to find sellers you've done business with in the past and go through them in the future, build a network of trustworthy sellers and you'll never have even a minor dispute on ebay. Hope this helps. P.S.S I won't purchase from anyone with feedback less than 98%-99%. Some people are just unreasonable but those folks are few and far between.",5,ebay.com

2044,I heard about ebay before but I am in England only little time. I have bought a lot of things now after my host family showed me what to do. I was so happy that everything has come quick - always on time so it is great. Problem 1 - I can't stop looking for new things to buy!!! 2. I don't have credit or bank card and need to sort this so I have to keep ask my host family to use their card and pay them. It is costing all my weekly pocket money!!,5,ebay.com

I think the deals were better a few years ago, but there are still good deals. Atleast ebay doesn't charge buyers for bidding (like bigdeal.com at 75 cents per bid) and ebay doesn't charge fees to buyers! The seller fees may continue to climb but they are still good to the buyers!",5,ebay.com

One situation did arise once where I was selling an Ipod and a scammer tried to buy it off of me but I checked their feedback and knew immideately and halted the auction and that was that. I do know that some people have had bad expereinces that that is unfortunate, I wish they could give it another shot because i've gotten some really great deals and i've found it has much to offer!",5,ebay.com
2049,"Ebay is by far the best auction site for many items on the web. I have been a member for several years. Over time, you learn how to avoid the bad sellers. As has been indicated, the feedback listings are a good way to avoid sellers you don't want to buy from. A few hints on making sure you always get your stuff quickly:  Look for sellers with 100% positive feedback. This really isn't that hard on most items, I have found. READ the feedback. A lot of times people will provide a positive or neutral feedback for a seller who is somewhat sluggish in getting stuff shipped. I hate slow shipping, even when the item is sent within a day of you winning the bid. When buying a video game system, be careful. The best option is usually to buy from a seller who has an ebay shop and seems to have a rather large professional looking ebay listing. These sellers tend to sell hundreds of units and are generally the most reliable sellers of new items like this and used items. Finally, ALWAYS use Paypal. If a seller does not accept paypal, something is up. It is the simplest and easiest method of paying for an auction won on ebay. It also has a very good dispute resolution process in case an item you pay for is never delivered. The fact that Paypal is owned by ebay makes it even better. So simply put, avoid sellers with slow shipping, regardless of feedback...it can be deceptive, buy certain items from sellers with good looking listings, and finally ALWAYS use paypal to pay for your purchases.",5,ebay.com

Don't blame the seller for only accepting Paypal, fees, or taxes that you did not know about because you did not fully read the auction first. Being a smart shopper is a must with eBay.

I called them a few times later receiving an e mail saying that I ever the had a relationship with some seller, or I was getting free or discounted stuff and that's the reason I was posting a good review and also my account had been banned from writing a reiview ever since. What really pisses me off is that there is always a botton there where you can choose to leave a review but when I do, I get a ban. After called them 10 times and speaking to 5 different managers, about a month after the issue. What I got told on the phone was basically, we will not provide you with anymore information, we will not prove anything to you and the decision is final, happy or not, deal with with it' how bad does it sound? All I asked was, if they are determined' I was violating against their 3 policies like I have said above, prove it to me that I actually know the seller or I was getting free stuff?

Back to the reviews, my package arrived at the UPS pick up location on time, unfortunately it was missing an item I had ordered. No big deal right? I'll just contact customer service let them know it wasn't included in my package and we can sort this out right? Nope! I contacted CS and they asked me to wait a few days so they could investigate and that maybe it had just been misshipped alright cool no problem. The next day I get and email stating that I've had a high number of ""missing/stolen orders"" returns and that I should review the return policy. I'm obviously confused cause as I had said its been well over a year since the only incident I've ever had with stolen packages. I contact CS again and they tell me I need to file a police report before they can go any further and provide them with information about the report....??? By this point I've explained to them several times that I had the item set for pick up from a carrier location so it wasn't stolen it just wasn't sent.

Now they are just returning the item to the seller without even telling me, after they told me they would deliver as soon as possible. Prior to the last month, I had never encountered any problems with Amazon, and now all these problems are occurring and I am wary when placing an order, almost anticipating some kind of error.

Martin at 208-529-1375. The FBI has also been notified and may also become involved as well since this case involved three or more states and many more people as well, maybe hundreds. This operation has been going on for some time and continues to this day with new fraud cases being added every day by the crooked sellers under the umbrella provided by Amazon.com which allows them to operate with impunity, and rip off Americans every day for hundreds and thousands of dollars and Amazon and Chase Bank also say it's not their responsibility. Chase has not retrieved all my funds from Amazon and Amazon has made no attempt to refund my funds. They have given me about a dozen different excuses, all different, all meaning nothing. Everyone says something different than the last person, adding up to nothing being done. Some of the excuses they used were: You filed the claim too early, also too late; I changed the dynamics of the order, I haven't returned the phone, the case has been closed, we're waiting for the seller to respond, you have to write to the seller, you are owed a refund, we'll send you $200.00 a week, we put $100.00 into your account for your problems (Sierra), I put $50.00 into your account for your problems, (Stephan),  and no money was deposited into my account.The seller: New and Mint Collectables located at 400 W.

I'm talking about my experience in buying a Huawei P20 Pro cell phone from your seller, who was/is a thief and sent me a piece of junk phone for my $709.00; Newandmintcollectibles.com in Chicago. The way your staff handles problems like this is deplorable, and shouldn't be handled like it is. You treat the buyer like he's the thief, and give the thief so much leeway that he can get and do just about anything he wants without any repercussions. YOU APPARENTLY DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO YOUR SELLERS RATINGS LIKE A NEGATIVE -88% WHEN IT SHOULD BE A +90 PERCENT BUSINESS RATING. And now I see you can't even find a trace of him on your site, but you're a little late, it appears he's already made off with the money and you expect me to absorb the loss, and you have no penalty. Then you have the audacity to have someone send me an email stating:Hello, We have closed your claim for order 112-1737567-3637863 because we have no evidence that the seller received your return. The seller has not received the return, and the information you provided does not prove that the package was delivered to the seller. As a result, this order is not eligible for the A-to-z Guarantee.

This whole thing would have never happened if you had a good IT man in your employment. I thought I was placing an order with FGS Trading, and because I changed the color of the phone from Black to Twilight, without my knowledge, it also changed the supplier to the con man that has been hiding under your umbrella for who knows how long and allowing him not to deliver a package or the wrong thing, as he has done in the past, and you allowed him to continue his fraud until he defrauded me out of $709.00 dollars. And you believe him and not me; that I returned the cheap piece of garbage to him. Well, there was a police officer here and he saw the package before I sent it out. And my postal guy will remember the package going out as well, I made sure of that. I also made a report to our sheriff and to the Chicago police as well.

Are you that greedy?SincerelyJerry SinkovecP.S. Beware of Amazon and their sellers!             Amazon is a thief just like their sellers, and worse, they endorse their thiefs        My worst shopping experience ever and I'm 82, and it was/is at Amazon.com. They are as big a thief as their sellers. They and the seller ripped me off for over $708.61, about 140.00 more! It was a Huawei P20 Pro cell phone that I never got. And they: Amazon.com and New And Mint Condition Collectables Attn: Ronen Gold, 400 W. Belmont, Chicago, IL committed a case of fraud against me.Chase Bank/Amazon/Amazon CC									12/21/2018Attn: Customer ServiceRef: Bonneville County Sheriffs Case # 201840833Ref: Claim ID: C-20181005-5465, Ref. CC 8636								To Whom It May Concern:The above claim with you has been turned into the Bonneville County Sheriff's Office and is case File Nr. 2018-40833 and is being handled by Sergeant J. Martin at 208-529-1375. The FBI has also been notified and may also become involved as well since this case involved three or more states and many more people as well, maybe hundreds. This operation has been going on for some time and continues to this day with new fraud cases being added every day by the crooked sellers under the umbrella provided by Amazon.com which allows them to operate with impunity, and rip off Americans every day for hundreds and thousands of dollars and Amazon and Chase Bank also say it's not their responsibility. Chase has not retrieved all my funds from Amazon and Amazon has made no attempt to refund my funds. They have given me about a dozen different excuses, all different, all meaning nothing. Everyone says something different than the last person, adding up to nothing being done. Some of the excuses they used were: You filed the claim too early, also too late; I changed the dynamics of the order, I haven't returned the phone, the case has been closed, we're waiting for the seller to respond, you have to write to the seller, you are owed a refund, we'll send you $200.00 a week, we put $100.00 into your account for your problems (Sierra), I put $50.00 into your account for your problems, (Stephan),  and no money was deposited into my account.The seller: New and Mint Collectables located at 400 W. Division, Chicago, IL has a long history of fraud on the internet which continues today and tomorrow. Amazon is protecting them from repaying or delivering the products promised to the buyers. There are many examples of this on Amazon's website under the seller's companies name which is owned by Ronen Gold, at 400 W. Division, Chicago, ILThe sad performance of Amazon (Dec.11th/18)           						         12/11/18In all my years, 82, never had I ever had such a bad shopping experience as with you; the crooked seller you allowed to operate under your umbrella for so long, and your staff who tried to mislead me, lied to me so many times and didn't do their jobs properly. I'm talking about my experience in buying a Huawei P20 Pro cell phone from your seller, who was/is a thief and sent me a piece of junk phone for my $709.00; Newandmintcollectibles.com in Chicago. The way your staff handles problems like this is deplorable, and shouldn't be handled like it is. You treat the buyer like he's the thief, and give the thief so much leeway that he can get and do just about anything he wants without any repercussions. YOU APPARENTLY DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO YOUR SELLERS RATINGS LIKE A NEGATIVE -88% WHEN IT SHOULD BE A +90 PERCENT BUSINESS RATING. And now I see you can't even find a trace of him on your site, but you're a little late, it appears he's already made off with the money and you expect me to absorb the loss, and you have no penalty. Then you have the audacity to have someone send me an email stating:Hello, We have closed your claim for order 112-1737567-3637863 because we have no evidence that the seller received your return. The seller has not received the return, and the information you provided does not prove that the package was delivered to the seller. As a result, this order is not eligible for the A-to-z Guarantee. If you need to return an item in the future, we recommend following these best practices to be sure that the seller receives your package: -- Include the order number on or inside the package. -- Insure the package. -- Use a signature confirmation delivery service. To learn more about coverage, visit our A-to-z Guarantee Help page on our Amazon.com site .amazon.c/a-to-z-guarantee.-- Date of Claim: November 23, 2018Sincerely,and there is no name on the message, so it makes it impossible for me to contact them. This whole thing would have never happened if you had a good IT man in your employment. I thought I was placing an order with FGS Trading, and because I changed the color of the phone from Black to Twilight, without my knowledge, it also changed the supplier to the con man that has been hiding under your umbrella for who knows how long and allowing him not to deliver a package or the wrong thing, as he has done in the past, and you allowed him to continue his fraud until he defrauded me out of $709.00 dollars. And you believe him and not me; that I returned the cheap piece of garbage to him. Well, there was a police officer here and he saw the package before I sent it out. And my postal guy will remember the package going out as well, I made sure of that. I also made a report to our sheriff and to the Chicago police as well. And maybe they'll find him even though he used a false address in Chicago. I'm sure they'll find him at the end of the trail which he'll leave behind. And you still owe me the amount mentioned above, because even some of your staff has told me I did everything correctly, and should have received my money back, as you state in all your little regulations that also say I should have received my money back in 7 to 10 days and haven't.

2091,"I have been a huge Amazon fan for years... Prime member for years.... almost all on-line shopping dine through Amazon. I have relied heavily on their customer reviews because I felt that they were an HONEST evaluation of a given product. I discovered this week that their reviews are a LIE. They CENSOR and BLOCK negative reviews of verified purchases. This is OUTRAGEOUS. I am shocked and dismayed and wish there was some way I could tell the public at large that AMAZON REVIEWS ARE A SCAM. They will block negative reviews so that people will continue to waste their money on junk products.  Here is the story and the proof.  I purchased a stupid Christmas beanie cap on one of their Black Friday lightning deals. It was only like $6 or $7. The fabric has Christmas lights around it and they supposedly lit up. I thought my high school daughter would get a kick out of it. Despite being Prime, it took like a week to arrive (their ""2 day guaranteed free shipping is another scam which has frustrated me, but not like this... not enough to make me quit the convenience of Amazon). It shows up yesterday and I pull it out of the package and discover that - not only does it NOT light up, it has zero wires and no battery pack. There is a small pocket sewn in the inside where the battery and switch are supposed to be, but again, there are no wires and no battery. It was cheap and I didn't really care enough to return it, but I went onto website to leave a review. (I will generally leave reviews on products that are either 5-star fantastic, or 1-star terrible. I think those experiences are most valuable to other shoppers.) I went into my account and started my review by clicking the one-star button. This should have allowed my to then title and explain my poor review. Instead, I git a message saying that Amazon could not accept my review if this product (mind you, all I had done was click the one star button.) They said that they had some unusual review activity' so they were blocking reviews of this product. I went back into the product image and lo and behold, I see the questions and comments part, I discover that multiple customers received hats just like me. No wires. No battery. And they were also very upset that Amazon was not allowing them to review it. So I sent Customer Service an email expressing my dismay at them blocking honest reviews of products by verified customers on their website. It took a full day (not the 12 hours promised) to reply, but this was the response: Hello Stacey This is Deleon from Communities. We couldn't accept your review for Windy City Novelties LED Light-up Knitted Ugly Sweater Holiday Xmas Christmas Beanie - 3 Flashing Modes (FA La La Beanie) because we detected unusual review behavior on this product.

Looking at the customer questions/answers, this has happened to a lot of people who ordered this as one of your Black Friday deals. I went to leave a review and it says that Amazon cannot accept my review of this product. What?!!! You are deciding that customers cannot review a product if something you are selling is total garbage? It is not worth my time nor energy to return it but I wanted to be able to at least warn other customers about this product. I have always relied heavily on customer reviews and is why I have always been a fan of Amazon despite numerous frustrations with shipping expectations that you set but rarely meet. Now I know that your reviews are a fraud. You shut down reviews of products that do not even meet basic standards. This company should NOT be allowed to sell through Amazon AND you should allow every verified customer to review any and all products that they have purchased. Shame on you. I will likely quit Amaxon because of this and will post on a review website that you are sensoring and blocking negative reviews. --------------- The bottom line is this: Amazon is a DISHONEST COMPANY who is censoring customers reviews to protect their bottom line. They want everyone to waste their money on this stupid garbage hat because it makes them money. They want us to believe that the reviews we read are real and are from verified' customers, but they don't tell you that it ya all a lie because they pick and choose which reviews to accept. It is really a disgrace. They were the first company to publish customer reviews in 1995 and now they have lost their way. SHAME on Amazon. I will miss the convenience of shipping with them but I cannot support such a loathsome, dishonest company any longer. I hope all who read this will boycott Amazon as well.",1,amazon.com
2092,"I was Amazon prime member from 2014, in last year and half they started doing things like: I order something and they keep delaying delivery for a days, when you order something they guarantee delivery by specific date, after they take your money they start explaining you that you didn't understand and is not always like that. They don't wait no even one day for me to pay, they cut membership in second and they take money in second, but, when you have problems, they keep explaining that you are wrong and they are right.

2097,"Amazon has their own ""delivery drivers"" now. The ONLY thing they deliver is NOTHING! I live in a small apartment complex that is mostly elderly people who order their meds and supplies online. Most of them never see their orders come in, as most of them use Amazon. According to the apartment manager, Amazon drivers will drive through the complex, but never stop. The few that do stop, NEVER bother to try and deliver to the address on the package, they try to dump it off on the manager. She tells them they cannot leave packages there as she isn't a postal center. These drivers get pissy and nasty because she forces them to deliver these packages to the actual addresses on the packages! She says most all of them will just get back in their trucks and leave, and won't even TRY to deliver to the address on the package. The manager came to work one day and said the maintenance man found a pile of Amazon packages dumped behind one of the bushes outside the building!!! The douchebag Amazon driver just dumped stuff in the bushes and left!!!!  DON'T ORDER ANYTHING FROM AMAZON!!!! Their ""drivers"" won't even attempt to deliver it to your door, and will end up dumping it in some bushes to get rid of it. They've even been seen dumping packages in local garbage cans!!!

This last time I recieved nothing and only found the charges when reviewing my credit card statement. I called and was told it would need to be reviewed as one of the charges was gifts cards that were already redeemed. The security on their website is shameful and even though the charges so far have been minimal I am tired of the one that is always has to do the work for their incompetent ability to have better security measures in place.",1,amazon.com
2101,"For months I've been trying to solve a billing dispute with Amazon and Chase (who does Amazon's billing). Last April Amazon offered a free month's trial of Amazon Prime shipping and I agreed to give it a try. During that month I realized that I don't order from Amazon enough to justify paying them $14.00 a month so I called them to cancel my membership. I also brought up the fact that they were charging me $7.99 a month for ""Amazon Digital Services"" (whatever the heck that is) and I certainly didn't order it. I was assured that they'd cancel my subscriptions and credit my account. They finally canceled the charges on my September statement but they added them back in the same statement! They had been charging me the $21.99 per month for five months and it ended up they didn't actually credit my account for even one! Every single time I've called, I've received the run around. Amazon's Customer Service Reps (five of them!) tell me I have to call Chase and Chase tells me I have to contact Amazon! An Amazon CSR sent me an email stating that I owe them nothing but Chase refused to give me their fax number or an email address that I could forward the email to. After an Amazon Rep pulled a ""we can't call Chase for you"" runaround yet again I replied that Chase has refused several times when I suggested they set up a conference call between them, me and Amazon, he stated that they weren't allowed to make conference calls either. I pointed out that (1) Amazon is the one who notifies Chase how much to bill me for and (2) he knows as well as I do that Chase is not going to take a customer's word for anything...it had to come from Amazon. I argued him down so he staged the conference call. When we got a Chase CSR by the name of Rajesh (ID # L348143) on the line, he asked me to verify my identity. He asked me my email address and I gave it to him. He said my answer was incorrect so, even though I doubted that since I gave him the one they send their emails to, I held back my anger and gave him my old email address. He again told me it was incorrect so he couldn't help me. While he was talking I signed into my Chase account, went to my profile page and sure enough, I gave him the correct address the first time. When I informed him that I was starring at my profile page and I had given him the correct email address, he denied it. When I asked the Amazon CSR (who had been silent throughout the exchange) to verify my identity, the Chase Rep realized he was a party to a conference call and he hung up on me. That's how ridiculous this whole mess has gotten. I called Amazon one last time this morning and spoke with Shahrukh (ID # I370786) and explained that my cancer meds cause memory loss and confusion and that's why I simply glanced at their statements and paid them whatever they said I owed. But it finally hit me that the last things I ordered were a microwave in February, 2018 and 2 very cheap software discs in March and since I'd paid them $40 to $60 every month, they had to be paid off by then. His solution was to credit my account for the two late charges that have been levied while I've been trying to settle the dispute. I told him that wasn't good enough because I'm not paying them another cent...in fact, they OWE ME $50.97. I'm going to report both companies to the FTC and the BBB and when it's settled, I will cancel my Amazon account and, believe me, I will tell everyone I know or meet about this experience.",1,amazon.com

2103,"Hello, Wanted to bring something to light that just happened to me when purchasing a high dollar scope from Amazon.com. I just purchased a Steiner T5Xi from Amazon the seller, not a 3rd party seller (want to be sure that is clear that this came direct from Amazon as the merchant) and when I received the package today I received a shrink wrapped sealed T5Xi box with a Steiner seals on both sides of the box underneath the shrink-wrap. However, all I actually received in the original box were 2 freakin Ice Mountain water bottles inside! I almost got sick.  Someone tried very hard to defraud either Amazon if it came from Steiner this way or an Amazon employee stealing and knowingly sending the package out this way. It had the LPN label on the outside of the box which usually indicates a previous customer return at some point which means, they were trying to pass it off as ""New."" What strikes me as very odd was that the manufacture stickers were still sealing the box inside the shrinkwrap. I cut them both myself. That, and the fact that whoever did this knew the weight of the scope to get almost exactly the same weight with the 2 water bottles.  I'm just in complete shock and awe. I've had someone try to rip me off before on eBay trying to say I sent them junk in a box. Thankfully, I record every package I send prior to shipping so I have the process on file for just these instances but the fact that it came from a billion dollar retailer sealed in this manner just baffles me.  I can attach some pictures of the box and seals and contents of the package.  This is the 2nd purchase of a scope in 1 week that was received as the wrong item. I also ordered a 3-12x44mm scope, again from Amazon the merchant, not a 3rd party merchant, and what I received was the same model but the 4-18x44mm version INSIDE the 3-12x44mm box. So obviously, they are selling used or returned items as ""New"" and their now $15 p/h employees are not even checking the boxes to verify the contents. I am done purchasing anything from Amazon, period. They are clearly falsely marking items as ""New"" that are previously used or returned items and the folks in charge of checking these things to ensure that they are returned correctly and properly retested are failing miserably.  Thanks for your attention, William Burnett",1,amazon.com

No, that's not what i want considering all of my packages were supposed to be signed for at delivery (previously like 4 months ago customer service set that up).

2115,"My hobby is building AK-47s. They are immaculate but sometimes when looking for parts I try and find a reasonable bargain. I usually add scopes to them and almost always buy from a military supplier in Belarus...a small country just west of Russia. I sometimes find good scopes on Ebay but I never knew that Amazon sold the Belarus scopes until recently. Amazon had a model scope I like and usually buy but I had never bought one from Amazon. These were cheaper than normal but since the wording was incorrect and some of the specifications displayed incorrectly I at first thought that who ever listed the article just was ill-informed and perhaps mismatched the prices. After all there were some of the correct scopes with the normal prices listed next to the scope I was interested in. Over the next hour I looked closely and the item had the Belarus markings in Ukrainian. The title had Russian terms. The scope was exactly the same as the ones shown on the Belarus site in every detail. I thought to myself that surely Amazon would not allow imitations and knock-offs to be sold on their site? So I bought the scope. The next morning I got an ""Your item has shipped"" with a Chinese post tracking number. The delivery date spanned two weeks which was a good indicator it was coming from China. I found out that indeed the scope I bought was a Chinese imitation. I tried to write a review of my experience but Amazon rejected it saying I could not say it was an imitation and of poor quality. The next morning I noticed the price went up $40. I noticed these scopes were intermingled among authentic scopes but there is no indicator that these scopes are mailed from China which would be the one key warning that all was not right. I have a whole new opinion of Amazon and their business practices.",1,amazon.com

I call Amazon to address the issues and their excuse was they were out of the tire I ordered. So maybe try calling your customer and making them aware of that instead of charging them $400 for a completely wrong tire that I can't even use! Now I am still stuck without a vehicle, short $400, and waiting for a driver to be ""in my area"" again to pick up the tires before I can even begin to get my money back!

I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill.

Evenflo Pivot Xpand Modular Travel System, Stallion https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077Y967XC/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_ciEJBbFXPFZ0B I ordered this stroller on August 17th. A week and a half later on Tuesday August 28th, the stroller was STILL not shipped out. I called amazon and I was assured that it would be shipped out soon and arrive by the 30th since it was a gift for a baby shower i have to TODAY (Sept 1st) Well guess what? The stroller was shipped out on THURSDAY and it's not here! I now have to go to the baby shower empty handed because Amazon took over TWO WEEKS to ship out the stroller! I have NEVER had service like this with amazon ever. Amazon used to be so great with their prompt service (I do not have prime) if I ordered something two weeks prior. Amazon also screwed up and sent me my items (of the same order) in a plain brown box without the amazon logo box that products always arrive in and I was missing two items! When I called amazon AGAIN I'm getting one of the items shipped to me at no extra charge, and the other item they wanted returned. How am I supposed to return something I never got? When I spoke to customer service, the woman I spoke with wasn't very apologetic, she was rather rude and tried to give me an amazon gift card so I could repurchase the item. I said no and to put it back on my credit card. That I would not be purchasing from amazon again. All I've had was headaches the past two weeks in dealing with them. I could have gone to Target, and paid the SAME price ($400) for the stroller and had it already and would have been prepared for my baby shower that I need to go today. Thank you amazon for ruining my gift for the baby shower. I should get the $7 dollar refund that the stroller is now up for ""sale"" with for my troubles. After speaking with amazon about my troubles they REFUSED to give me the $7 back for my troubles and ended up giving me line after line of bull$#*! of why they couldn't give me a credit of $7. They also deleted my review of the ""stroller"" (which was titled appropriately ""this is a review of amazon not the stroller"") because it did not meet their ""guidelines"", it doesn't meet their guidelines because I was speaking badly about amazon and god forbid they have any negative comments floating around, my god they might lose business.

The first order was a birthday gift, the customer service said they have notified UPS to deliver it by the birthday date. It did not happen, and the package was delivered 3 days after the birthday. My most recent purchase was a mobile phone worth $1000. I scheduled the delivery one week after because no one will be home to receive it. I was surprised that they changed it to 2 day shipping. So, I called UPS and UPS told me to talk to Amazon to change the date. I chat with Amazon 3x and all 3 representatives assured me that it will arrive on my expected date and not the date that I was seeing on the tracking. Representatives said that UPS will not leave it outside if no one is at home and that they already notified UPS. When I saw the tracking saying out for delivery, I immediately contacted Amazon for a 4th time. Representative told me again not to worry, that UPS just put it in the truck but it won't be delivered and that UPS will not leave it outside. Guess what?! UPS left it outside the house. Amazon will say ANYTHING to assure a customer, but I doubt they even talked to UPS on the phone to make sure it really will be delivered on the date I wanted.  So, I chat with Amazon 2 more times after that and told them to send UPS back to pick the package for return to Amazon and issue me a full refund. Amazon rep is stupid to ask if I can send someone to check if the package is still there. If I had someone to check it, then I would ask that person to take it until i can get it.

Don't think for a moment that WAPO isn't looking out for the Amazon billionaire's interests. There is another possibility, the company is advertising the sale of an item they don't have and won't have available unless a sufficient number of people express interest before they order from their China supplier.

2140,"I use to highly enjoy Amazon at first then it all became about Prime. Less and less became accessible to clients unless they upgraded to a Prime account. I ceased purchasing several items because they became Prime only members. When I did try Prime I found you needed to make at least 10 purchases a year to make it worth while. Other wise it's not really worth it. I found they lie about the shipping dates all the time. Especially during the holidays. Starting around early October shipping is unreliable and they can barely keep up with the order volume.  If an item becomes backordered your purchase sits until it comes in. No way to cancel it. This keeps happening to me. Not one word of notification it was backordered just pending, pending and pending for weeks. I had to call and ask. They told me they could not cancel it. Amazon use to be high quality items that would last a while and reasonably priced. Now it's a China junk store with all the c*rappy merchandise you could want that's been sold to the cheapest bidder that will break after a few uses. Amazon is not regulating the items they sell and the quality is just going down hill. Customer service is also another issue. Customer service is terrible. If you get a gift card that does not work it's hell being on the phone for up to an hour or two just trying to get the dumb thing to work. No point in going to the store you purchased it from because gift card booths are contracted out. They're just selling the item they do not own it.  I've also noticed Amazon reviews to be some what fluffed and most if not all are lies. Every Amazon review I post seems to either be A) edited beyond what I originally wrote and is not even close to what I wrote. Hence plagiarism. or B) Denied if it's the slightest bit negative that hints the product is defective or bad. I am a price shopper and go with the highest quality item at the lowest bid. Amazon over charges their clientele and I wonder just how long I have been over paying for things. Most retailers on Amazon over charge their items any where from 15-25% all the way up to 50% marked-up compared to your local retailer.

Fist, they sent incorrect return addresses twice, then after tracking said they received the dress, they would not respond to either me or Amazon!

2150,Amazon USED to be great years ago but now treat their customers like dirt. Too many times have I encountered rude and unprofessional behavior from their reps. Each time it has been a simple matter that should have been resolved easily. Not so. I have worked retail and was an engineer by profession. I fully understand how difficult the job is and how critical good customer service is to the success as a company. In my experience Amazon doesn't care or take the issue seriously. I WAS a longtime customer but no longer. I'm taking my business elsewhere and urging everyone else to do the same!,1,amazon.com

2152,"I've only ordered a few things on Amazon but I've had several heinous experiences including the current one that I'm going to go to other suppliers. On Memorial Day, I had to choose between buying a mattress online or going to a local mattress store. I've asked elated and place an order through Amazon and then was going to change my mind but Amazon had already ""shipped"" the item. That's shorthand for took my money. The item was supposed to be here Thursday of last week and FedEx said it was on the truck ready to be delivered, but their driver drove right past and then lied and said nobody was in the apartment office or at home. There were three people in the office waiting for the delivery and one person at home waiting for the delivery. So we called FedEx and ask them if they could please deliver the item as they are contracted to and do their actual job. On Friday of course the same driver drove past we watched him drive past and refuse to stop again he entered into his terminal that nobody was there which is a complete fraudulent lie there were three people in the office and one or two people in the apartment. We called FedEx and they had no sympathy other than to say the driver had grossly made an error and other than that go screw yourself for using FedEx. I communicated with the mattress company on Amazon and they said my communications were inappropriate and that it would be there on Monday. Then I noticed that any negative review Amazon is deleted immediately. I truly believe this is why one should not invest in Amazon stock I believe they are greed based, fraudulent, and ready for a crash. Why? The same exact thing happened on Christmas with Amazon, and other items I've ordered from Amazon have been stale and needed to be returned. I guess ordering from Amazon is like ordering from a really bad 99 Cent Store except you don't get to keep your product. Boycott.",1,amazon.com

2154,"Been a sub-Prime member for years. First was $80 per year, then $100, now $120. But, free, ""GUARANTEED 2 day delivery, on items that qualify, wow. You also get sub-Prime video, think of it as Netflix-lite-lite. Great video selection, not. My main gripe are the tactics used to purchase an item. Sub-Prime? Check. Free 2-day shipping? Check. Item Prime and in stock? Check. You are also told, ""order within the next ""count-down timer"", and get ""Guaranteed Delivery by ""this"" date. Here is where the problem starts. After purchase is made, you start getting messages that the item, items, will be coming later, and later and later. The only ""GUARANTEE"" is to expect this regularly. I contacted AMAZON to ask what the ""GUARANTEE"" means. Was told, ""We are sorry for your experience and will extend your Sub-Prime membership another month for free"". Wow. Thats like getting food poisoning at a restaurant and the owner offers you a doggy-bag of same food for your troubles. Amazon employs used car salesman tactics and time sensative pressure to make you purchase an item. Once they have your money. They laugh all the way to the bank. You will get your item whenever they feel like it. I suggest this. DO NOT pay for useless Sub-Prime membership. Pay for 2 day shipping per item, if supplier offers it and cannot meet requirements, Amazon will refund your shipping cost. So, either you get it on time, or shipping is free. And you dont pay $120 a year for nothing. I also verified the refund thru Amazon, but not if your Sub-Prime.

Like many of the Amazon drop shippers, they post ads for things on different websites. When someone buys something from them, they just turn around and look for something else on the web that's cheaper and have the real seller send it to their buyer. They are actually dropshippers that have been around for a long time. They were banned on Amazon, Amazon closed their account and they had to wait 3 months to set up a new account, which is why they appear to be new sellers. We're not sure, but based on the timing, we believe they may be the old seller ""DailyDeals"", whose scams got them shut down on Amazon.  Chris's Bargains prices are outrageous, because of course as scammers they are just skimming money off the top. We're shocked people fall for the scam, but Amazon is doing nothing to stop it, since they are raking in fees when every book sells twice. Just know, That like the rest of the dropshippers, if you buy a book from them or anything else, you are paying a lot more than you need to, and all they are going to do is by a cheaper book from another person that had it posted on Amazon and send it to you.

The TV did not come on the promised day which caused much inconvenience. Finally, the package arrived. I removed the TV from the box, and much to my surprise, the entire screen was cracked. Upon closer examination I found a huge hole in the side of the box. The television had not been properly packed; there was nothing in the box to prevent screen damage. Needless to say, I immediately returned the product. It was a big mistake to purchase this item used! Later on that evening, I went to Best Buy and purchased a new 990e for $115.00 more. I couldnt believe the extra measures that were taken in the packaging to insure that there would be no damage to the set. Id also like to mention, that a set of new Dolby Atmos headphone were also ordered at the same time. What I received was a used set of headphones poorly packed with important parts missing.

Since their email did not elaborate what the issue was but merely asked for information on my credit card, I had to make assumptions on the possible problems and responded with the details requested and explanations.  More than a day later, in response, I get another email from amazon asking me to log in to my account and upload my credit card statement.  However, since my account was blocked I was not able to log into my account and hence I could not upload the card statement either. I sent amazon a note on my predicament and at the same time thought I might as well speak to their customer service consultant to expedite the matter.

It takes several emails to solve issues and most of the time Amazon's employees don't even understand what the customer needs. Amazon only cares about their profit margin. Customer satisfaction doesn't matter. They have also stopped using the Post Office for delivery, and their Amazon drivers aren't competent. I've had orders misdelivered since the Post Office was dropped as their shipper. Amazon drivers were also caught using USPS boxes for their deliveries, which is a Federal offense. These packages were confiscated by USPS and customers were having to pay postage due. Amazon soon learned NOT to use USPS property for Amazon delivered items. This is just one example of how Amazon does business ... they lie, cheat and defraud whenever they are allowed.  I've just about given up in Amazon, as they never improve.

2172,Ive been a faithful amazon customer for yrs because it is convenient as a stay at home mom. I loved getting my purchases a writing detailed reviews so others wouldn't have the hassle I sometimes had a a product with no reviews.

Therefore I continue to buy from that store because of a good experience so I'm considered biased and have relations with tgat store. Go to hell amazon. Now I can't do what I enjoy doing. Writing reviews. In my opinion you should stop all reviews if y9ur going to point fingers. Better yet get y9ur fingers out of your bosses ass and look at the big picture.

2175,"In relation to Order # 205-8187368-2071530: On 18th December I placed an order with Amazon for around £250 worth of items using their Prime 'Guaranteed Next Day' delivery service. The order consisted 11 different items (a range of toys and other gifts bought for Christmas to give to family and friends). Amazon in the past have been a very reliable and reputable company with exemplary customer service so I felt that this was a convenient and safe option to make sure I had everything arrive in time for Christmas. This, however, was the start of my Christmas nightmare. The following day, nothing arrived. This was not an issue however, as my family were not coming to visit until the following Saturday so there was still another 4 days left before it would present any sort of problem for me. On the Wednesday, 3 of the 11 items turned up. On Thursday, nothing. On Friday morning, I finally receive a phone call from my sister (whose address the parcels were due to arrive at) telling me she was starting to get worried as most of the items had still not arrived and they had to be ready and wrapped for the following day to give to my visiting family members who live in a different part of the country. Given the urgency of the situation, I decided to take a break from work and give Amazon's customer service department a call. I initially spoke to a member of their team who looked into the situation and found that the items had indeed not been delivered, but that it should be fine and they would most likely arrive later that day. I explained my situation to them and told them that essentially if the items did not turn up I would be stuck with nothing to give to my family to open on Christmas day. I asked this member of staff to look into the situation again so that they could absolutely guarantee this, at which point the line goes quiet and a few seconds later the call terminates. Not being satisfied with the outcome, I decide to call back again at which point I get through to another customer service agent who again appears to hang up the call. By this point I was getting very frustrated but given that I had no choice I decided to call them again. By this time, it was 3:00pm and I had already wasted around half an hour of my working day trying to sort the situation out. I then get through to customer service agent number 3, who I explain to that I haven't received my items - to which he replies that they will definitely arrive by 9pm that night. I then explain to the agent that I need this absolutely guaranteed as if they do not deliver the items by 9pm I would then not have an opportunity to go out Christmas shopping that day in order to replace the items they had not delivered. After some deliberation he agrees to go and double check for me, and, surprise surprise, he tells me that the parcels won't be arriving after all. By this point, I was absolutely fuming. I could not believe that after 5 days of waiting on their 'Guaranteed Next Day' delivery and an hour on the phone speaking to 3 different people they were actually telling me they were not able to deliver my parcels. All of this given that they DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE DECENCY to contact me and let me know what was going on. Had my sister not bothered to contact me, I wouldn't have even known until the following day (by which point it would be too late). Anyway, I continued my conversation with agent number 3 and explained that I was absolutely disgusted by their level of service and that my only option was to finish work early (costing me around £50 in lost pay), travel to the town centre and spend the rest of my afternoon/evening shopping for presents that I didn't have the money for (since I had already spent it with Amazon). The initial response to this was to offer me a £5 Amazon gift card and 1 month free Amazon Prime (frankly an insult given the situation). They then offer me a refund to which I tell the agent it does not compensate me for the situation they have caused and I would be making a complaint and closing down my account (which I have had for over 10 years and spent many thousands of pounds with them on). He then decides to go and speak to his manager, and agrees that they will still fulfill the order and I will receive the items in due course, and they will issue me a full refund (which would instantly arrive in my account) for the items not yet received. Although I was not happy about having to leave work and roam around the town centre buying presents, I felt this was fair compensation and the best they could do given the situation. We then end the call and I head out of work. I arrive in a very busy town centre and attempt to look for anything which may be suitable given the money I had on my card. I enter Toys R Us and grab some toys for my niece and nephew, head to the counter and get my card out to pay. I enter my PIN and find that my card has been declined. I then try again, but it appears as though there is no money in my account. I then leave Toys R Us (the time is now about 5:00pm) and head to the Cashpoint machine to find that my refund has not yet arrived. I go on Amazon's live chat and the person I speak to tells me that the refund will arrive in 5-7 working days. Desperate, I call one of my friends who agrees to lend me £50 (not exactly enough for 8 gifts but better than nothing). I then spend my evening around town buying anything I can so at least there is something for my family to open for Christmas (aware that the items should arrive later on and I could always try and post them later). Christmas then comes and goes without too much bother. It comes to my attention in the first week of January however that the items had still not been delivered, so I decide its time to give Amazon another call. I get through to a customer service agent, and after saying a few words the call hangs up, so I call back again. I then get through to another agent who explains to me that my refund has been issued. I tell him that I have received the refund but I was still waiting for the items, for which he says the items had been returned and would not be sent out again. I then explain to them that I was still supposed to receive the items as per the agreement I made with them on the 22nd of December, to which he replies (surprise) that there are no notes on the system to this effect. He agrees to raise the issue with a manager for it to be investigated and I would definitely receive an email back about this in 5-7 days. 2 weeks later, I still have no email or items, so I call Amazon again. After calling them three times and being hung up on and spending around 45 minutes on the phone I am finally put through to a supervisor. They tell me again that there is no notes on the system and there has been no investigation into my case. This time, I am promised a call back the following day at 5:00pm once the investigation has been done. I sit next to my phone at 5:00pm the following day but do not receive a call. I then check my Amazon account to find a message sent saying that they 'weren't able to reach me' and they were sorry that I was 'misinformed' that I would still receive the items. They tell me I should call back again for more information about it. I can tell you I have now given up trying to deal with their shambolic customer service team. The entire experience has been absolutely disgraceful and they should be ashamed of the way they have treated me as a longstanding and loyal customer of 10 years. I am now going to be closing my account with them and I will be posting my experience on every major review site online as well as telling all my friends and family. Amazon has embarrassed me at a supposed happy time of year and they don't seem to give a monkeys about their customers anymore. I will now be reporting them to the Advertising Standards Agency regarding their false advertising claims and I will be speaking to BBC's Watchdog about my case.

Today January 8th Amazon.fr send me an email saying ""THEY ARE SORRY"" but the item was cancelled by them because there was a ""error"" on the price (Which is not my problem because I didn´t do anything wrong more than be a regular customer who bought the item and is waiting for it as a responsible website they claim to be). What makes me think they want to cheat customers with this prcie changes, if there will be a ""mistake"" the system shouldn´t allow me to buy the item I think ... but imagine if I take an item on X price in their website (which I use to be a customer for several years and I will stop after this) and I pay less than the price because is ""my mistake"" they wont send me anything right?

2180,"I purchased an Amazon Echo in the US to use in Canada. I originally used a US address to set it up and always wanted it to be based in Canada. I was delighted when Amazon announced the Echo would be available in Canada. I changed the address easily and all was good until I wanted to add a skill. When I tried to add the skill it told me my language need to be set to Canadian English. I went into the setting and Canadian English was not available.  I called Amazon and after being passed to 5 people, I was told it had to be resolved by Amazon Canada and someone would get back to me. They never did, but all of a sudden Canadian English could be selected but could not be saved to the Echo. I again phoned Amazon, and after trying to get me to do the same things I had already done I was told that was just too bad, it was a US device and would only work in the US, even though the language selection was there it just would not save to the device. I spoke to a supervisor (Chase) and he said he would put in a problem report, but I have no reference or timeframe. So a big International company like Amazon has a fundamental problem like not being able to save language preferences and it seems it is just too bad, In the end they just want you to go away or buy a new device. The customer service is just bad,",1,amazon.com
2181,"Today, I submitted a review and Amazon decided not to post it. They sent me an email stating they were not going to post it. This only upset my further. Here is the email that I sent them. Please note that this website does not allow me to upload pictures I mentioned in the following email. _______________ I ordered both of my grandsons in Texas this jacket. When the jacket arrived, it did not match exactly what was ordered from the picture. Please see the pictures I have attached. What interested my grandson's most about the jacket was the uniqueness of the colors, the color scheme, and the jacket that was received did not have the white zippers. We live a thousand miles apart, and it was too much of an inconvenience to return the jacket and ask for the money back.",1,amazon.com
2182,this company sells thru Amazon This is not an American company or Amazon Company However they sell their products. I bought a heat press only pressed 5 shirts total before it quit working contacted Amazon I could not get this resolved and have had to take a 269.68 lost because I did not have it shipped to the company in 45 days. I did ask for a return label as well as a refund and received neither. I am new to the online shopping world and have not had a great deal of experience with these types of problems. The problem was reported to Amazon/Happibuy before 45 days however it was never resolved. Please be cautious when buying from Happibuy they don't honor their products and actually suggest I take 150.00 and sell it to someone else?? and yes I have this in writing.,1,amazon.com
2183,"Amazon collected last minute orders with the promise of Christmas Eve delivery for free with Prime via 2nd day air. 6 days later, the package is ""delayed do to capacity"" which means that UPS was so oversold on Xmas Eve, they couldn't even deliver it the day after Christmas. In this customer's case, I compromised and ordered an inferior product just so it would be on time for Christmas and it's still nowhere to be found. UPS is covering it's own hide by not even tracking it anymore, saying it could be as late as the 29th. Given the nature of Christmas and it's timeliness, this broad fraud scheme was a bait and switch and is illegal advertising. Amazon probably defrauded hundreds or even thousands of customers with their false and misleading promise.",1,amazon.com
2184,I ordered some shirts for Christmas with a delivery date of December 12-15. Unfortunately I still do not have the items yet amazon has my money! This makes me very leery about using Amazon regardless of vendor if they dont do what they say they are going to do. At this point I am expecting a full refund and wondering how the refund process will go. If it takes more than a phone call to get the credit back on my credit card I for sure will not use amazon again. Is this what happens when you get too big?,1,amazon.com
2185,"As everyone knows, it is virtually impossible to avoid shopping at Amazon. I certainly would avoid it if I could though! I have placed at least 3 orders in the last 6 months that just never get delivered. Yes, they don't charge me for them. But they just don't deliver. What kind of website takes orders and just ignores them? I even bought the ""Prime"" membership to try to get my orders - but no such luck. I don't know what happened to Amazon - I guess it is the secondary suppliers - but they are TERRIBLE. I still have multiple orders from months and months ago that are unfulfilled. When I order something, I am NOT indifferent as to whether it gets delivered or not. I am usually counting on that product for some use.",1,amazon.com

2187,"I recently called Amazon to request a refund of fees for a service for which I'd not contracted. Amazon's very cheery customer service assured me it was no problem. I then explained that I no longer used the credit card to which the fee was being charged, so could they refund it to my bank account or to another card?  As these words were issuing from my mouth, the happy-go-lucky customer service representative sent the refund to the card I no longer used. When I asked why he did not allow me to explain what I needed, he became less cheery. Needless to say, the credit card company where I no longer had an account had little time for my request to resend the funds to Amazon -- and who can blame them? A second email to Amazon produced a boilerplate response. You get a prepared message that has some peripheral relationship to your request, and it tells you to look at the FAQ or something like that.  A reply to this produced a response from a representative who seemed capable of logical reasoning. His reply, however, was grim: He explained that Amazon could do nothing, unless maybe the funds came back, and maybe not even then.  It is somewhat amazing: Amazon is reputed to have the best customer service in the world, but it appears to be fraying at the edges. Too many bots, and not enough representatives? Or is there little difference these days at this company? I recommend you to take great care with your dealings with this mastodontic mess.",1,amazon.com
2188,"I signed up for Amazon's Prime Membership trial. There was no fine print during the sign-up saying that I was actually subscribing to the full membership. There was no disclaimer saying that I had to cancel my subscription (not trial sign-up like it was advertised) if I did not want to pay $90 for something that I was not sure if I wanted or not. I was not hooked on Prime during the trial and so I did not subscribe to it afterward....... thinking that was the process......... So... when the trial ended, Amazon automatically TOOK $90 from my credit card WITHOUT my knowledge. As far as I'm concerned, this company is shady and disreputable. I'm not using any Amazon products or services again and will be sure to pass along what I've learned to family and friends.",1,amazon.com

I requested a call from customer service, there was apparently an issue w/ my debit card, my bank issues a daily limit, which my order had exceeded. No problem, I asked the customer rep if I could give him my routing # and Bank acct # and he could withdraw the total. He put me on hold and said he couldn't do it, it didn't work, I said how could you have tried it I haven't given you my bank info yet. He tried to run my debit card again after I told him about the bank limit. After trying to explain what I was asking again, I realized this moron doesn't know what I'm talking about. I gave him a credit card, which took him about a 1/2 hour to figure out, I pull up my order while we're talking and it says 2 day delivery, guaranteed delivery by Tuesday, December 26th, meanwhile, today is Thursday, December 21, (2 days would be Saturday Dec. 23rd). I brink this to the attention of the representative, I really want it delivered by Christmas...his solution is to cancel the order on his end and for me to go online and resubmit the order...are you fricken kidding me, I've just spend 45 minutes on the phone with this moron, telling him it's a Christmas present. He can't change the delivery to overnight it on his end. I ask to speak with his supervisor, I'm extremely uncomfortable at this point with anything he has to tell me. He puts me on hold for a second and gets back on the phone and states that he's not going to put me on with a supervisor because he's one of the supervisors in his department. I've never wrote a review for any company before, good or bad, but the person I spoke to clearly had no idea what he was doing and I would have thought w/ all the trouble I had with this order that they may have given me better assistance in expediting the order. As much as I like the selection of items on Amazon, I will never use them again, there are other companies like Overstock,com, that have much better, knowledgeable Customer Service Representatives willing to work with you to solve your issues.",1,amazon.com

Best buy was to put a return credit bk to it . I look and see I used Amazon well long story short they purchased things from 6 different sellers and had shipped to another state. The biggest one was 2 prime Accts 100 bucks a piece. This makes the 3rd time for myself both my parents had it happen as well. Before everyone says get better anti virus I do I.T and networking.

2196,I use to go to Amazon for everything. I would save a ton. If I made a mistake they would help me and refund me promptly. Recently I have had some troubles with them. Refunds never refunded and items sent damaged to the point I was cut open not knowing the bottom of an electronic was cracked which led me to the hospital today due to an awful infection I got from the unit. Amazon wouldn't replace the item even though it was covered in my blood and returning it would expose others to blood borne pathogens. I discarded the dangerous contaminated unit and Amazon refused to help me remotely. They offered me $5 gift card for my troubles and I never got that even. So sad I loved Amazon,1,amazon.com
2197,"I am NOT a fan of Amazon, but it was not always this way. In spite of the shipping costs; which add anywhere from 50% to 150% of the cost of the item being ordered to the final cost of that order. No, that I was able to overlook. My problem with Amazon is actually with their third-party sellers. Amazon is not doing its due diligence in determining whether these are reputable sellers worthy of having access to Amazon's advertising and customers. My kindle is full of books bought with free books given me by Amazon due to countless gaffs by; ""Yep, you guessed it""; third party sellers. Unfortunately most of the items I require are not offered by Amazon, and therefore NOT stocked in their warehouses. I have been sent items that I did not order instead of what I did order, I have NOT received anything at all, I have been informed the day before the item was supposed to be delivered, that it would not be coming at all. My laundry list of reasons why I am BOYCOTTING AMAZON. But none of them are actually Amazon's fault. Well, not directly their fault. But their negligence in rectifying this state of affairs, has created or allowed this deplorable inconsistency in service to exist. That being said; if Amazon were to take my countless suggestions about eliminating Third-party sellers, or were they to find a way to find some way to ensure me that I would receive what I ordered, when I ordered it, or if they could guarantee a significantly earlier email telling me the item cannot be delivered. If they didn't rip me off for a large portion of my shipping costs when those items are not delivered then I would go back to them in a second.",1,amazon.com

This was supposed to be credited within 1-2 hours. Nope. So i called again and spoke to someone else who magically was able to immediately credit my account. So i immediately ordered the shoes and called back like i was told to do. I was then told the shoes would be overnighted on December 6 and i would receive them on December 7. I was even given a tracking number. Turns out she lied and gave me tracking number for the shoes i already had. She also said i would get a $20 credit on my account. Great. So Thursday morning i again called and was told no they werent shipped but they would be overnighted Thursday. And guaranteed to arrive by Friday at 8pm. Still no shoes. Disappointed daughter. And still no help from Amazon. Excuse after excuse. Im actually a Prime member, so Im apparently paying to be screwed over. So angry. Ive never seen this much incompetence from one company.

Within about 15-20 minutes when I went back to my basket on Amazon, they had changed things. My shipping was no longer free and the body lotion I ordered went up $1.00 - in my basket, they said there had been a price change in the body lotion.

As amazon gets bigger it will only suffer the same problems that got me shopping on there in the first place and for me I started shopping on amazon because I was tired of poor customer service and inflexible store policies. (ie. Walmart, Target, etc.) I bet they won't even see this post or care but they just lost a customer who used to buy thousands of dollars of goods a year exclusively with amazon and would rather stand in line at Walmart then deal with their lies.

I was not comfortable buying an expensive phone from a 3rd party vendor on Amazon due to warranty issues and not knowing where these vendors are getting their merchandise. I received the phone. I was shocked to find that it was not a new phone but it was already used. It came just thrown in a box. It wasnt even factory sealed. The phone even had a screen protector on it placed by the prior user. The box that it was in was very beat up and had an address label from some 3rd party vendor who had previously shipped it out a month ago. Needless to say, I was very dissapointed. I contacted Amazon's customer service who acted like it was not a big deal. Clearly this happens alot. However, this was the first time I had personally experienced it.

October 9, 2017 5:25:27 AM Michael W. (CSA) : I completely understand, but we cannot force the manufacturer to honor a warranty that's being shipped outside the US. In terms of compensation for the incorrect information, I'm willing to make a one-time exception, and issue a $50 Amazon promotional credit to your account. You can use the credit towards your next purchase that is shipped and sold by Amazon.com. October 9, 2017 5:26:23 AM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : Well, I know you cannot force the manufacture, but dell provides premium support for international warranty, but that costs extra fee, So if you could compensate the seller the cost of premium support for the laptop which includes international warranty for 2 years. October 9, 2017 5:27:18 AM Michael W. (CSA) : Do you know how much the premium support costs, Kaushal?

Please send me the copy of this chat to my email. and also mail me the further details about your actions for compensating me. Thank you October 9, 2017 5:30:42 AM Michael W. (CSA) : I've looked through the correspondence between you and the seller, and I'm afraid I see no mention of premium support in regards to the warranty. ***** October 9, 2017 3:51:42 AM Initial Question: Does this ORDER # 113-2215371-0609818 includes warranty?

Spoke to 5 different customer service people that explained there is nothing they can do. They have a deeply flawed system and dont believe their own customers, so the gift was just wiped out. No offer of credit or even to discuss it with fraud prevention, just wanted to get us off the phone. Now my wife is crying.",1,amazon.com

If you want to contact someone to get more information all they do is copy a link to their help section of their website, they state they cannot help in their department and place you on hold.

Amazon refuse to tell me how to repack it to ship it back or give me a refund. Then after days of calling finally a amazon rep promise me I would get a refund for my trouble. I ask her twice she said yes I would. Just to make sure I called back and ask a second amazon rep she said yes you are getting a refund. The next day I am told I am not, they cant help me with shipping it back either. I am stuck with something I have to pay for that I have no use for. Will not ever shop with amazon again.

Last contact to them involved several phone calls within a 30 minute time span where they kept disconnecting me. They won't accept my reviews (even favorable ones) for products I have purchased from their site, which now leads me to believe many of the reviews are fake. Prime video I think is a joke. I don't believe this company is what it used to be. IMHO you can get Walmart and Target to match Amazon's prices. In my opinion, the purpose of Amazon is to get you to buy products you don't actually need. IMHO they do not have the lowest prices, and I have actually purchased products such as vitamins and supplements for far less cost on Ebay.

I can go to Walmart or jet or any other company and they ship it out within 24 hours so I have called them multiple times about this but it seems like it doesn't help so I have decided not do business with Amazon no more until they change their policy maybe if everybody does this they'll change there policy or maybe it will make them go out of business and would just start shopping at Walmart and jet,1,amazon.com

2227,"I purchased a 65 inch SUHD TV through Amazon.com. I purchased within their marketplace sector of their website. The TV was delivered damaged. Amazon has refused to help. Here is the main problem. Amazon marketplace is a wild west of vendors that apparently have no vetting process and some are not even companies. This was my experience. I purchased the TV from a vendor called Infinity Loop. Infinity loop initially talked to me and gave me a phone number when i reported the damaged TV. I called and the warehouse didn't even know who Infinity Loop was. I had to explain my purchase from Amazon and the operator directed me to a rep. That rep said they would have get the owner to call back. Well that never happened. They stopped communicating all together. I had to use Amazon messaging (dozens of attempts to get them to respond). I eventually contacted Amazon who gave me a warm and fuzzy about helping me. Well after . several supervisors and several warm and fuzzies they eventually said they couldn't help and wouldn't continue to respond.  Here is the problem. I received the TV damaged. It's obvious by the pictures it's a forklift punch through the box and into the screen. I asked the driver about the hole in the box and he told me it happens all the time and put my hand through it and check.  He assured me the TV's are always fine. I checked and only felt that soft velvety cover they put over the screens. Nothing at all made me think that the screen actually was touched. I was in the process of moving and didn't unpack the well packed TV just to repack it for my move. My mistake. I should have unpacked and checked it. HOWEVER it doesn't change the fact it was delivered DAMAGED. When i unpacked it i saw a small tear (about the size of a dime) in the outer cover. I took the cover off and found the deep gouge in the screen but no cracking or any other visible damage. I plugged it in and the screen was totally unusable. Since then it's been a very disappointing experience with Amazon. No matter what evidence I've sent in regarding the size/shape of the hole fitting a warehouse forklift fork....the link between Mizari and Infinity Loop....the shipping company acknowledging the damage likely happened while in their control (only Mizari can file a claim as the account holder).....my horrible experience trying to work with Amazon customer service......they disappeared and forced me to seek legal advice. I've had to file a small claims case against Amazon to try to get my money back.  Infinity Loop doesn't exist. There is no business license for them anywhere. I did research the warehouse and phone number and found out they are actually called MIZARI Enterprises. Mizari denies any knowledge of Infinity Loop. Mizari and Infinity loop have the same address in Commerce CIty, CA and have the same phone number. The shipping receipt has Mizari's address on Wilshire Blvd in Los Angeles. Mizari shipped the TV. The shipping company confirmed this. It's amazing to me that AMAZON is defending MIZARI and their fraudulent marketplace vendor INIFINITY LOOP and not their customer.  Amazon marketplace is a huge gamble and risk should anything go wrong",1,amazon.com

It never arrived and when I checked the status on Amazon website, I was shocked to see the status updated as delivered and parcel handed over to the residents at my address. Nobody rang my door bell or knocked. I was home just to receive the delivery. Now I am entangled in an unnecessary dispute resolution involving american express and amazon. Amazon hasn't so far provided any proof of who signed for the parcel. Every time I call them I reach a new customer service rep who keeps saying they will get back to me within 48 hrs. And later send an email saying the parcel has been delivered to my address.

2236,"Being a seller in Amazon's marketplace is now a bit of a joke. Like eBay, it's been one round of 'compliance' after another, sometimes due to EU rules treating everyone as potential money-laundering terrorists. As a seller, I was working for peanuts, as the competition is so great and the 15% commission excessive.  With increasing use of Amazon's FBA (fulfilled by Amazon), I was increasingly failing to win the 'Buy Box' and so losing out on orders, as many people don't bother to compare prices and sellers. Even when I was cheapest and with 100% feedback, Amazon and FBA sellers were just about always, if not always, rewarded with the Buy Box. From now on, I am going to try to grow my brand without Amazon. For one thing, customer loyalty is almost zero with Amazon marketplace. The danger for consumers is that, because Amazon has been happy to work for next to no profit for years, they are able to undercut almost everyone. And because of Amazon's vast reach, many businesses feel that they have to sell there, often selling at lower prices than on their own website, despite Amazon's charges. The consequence could be that in another decade or two, nearly all internet sales are handled through third party sites like eBay and Amazon. Businesses will basically no longer be independent, increasing merchandise will be banned as they are deemed politically incorrect (such as all Confederate flag items, as just one example). They will be able to set prices by setting their fees and we will only have easy access to the books they think we ought to read and the music and films we should own and the food we should eat. Join me in boycotting Amazon, as a seller and as a buyer, otherwise we will be at the mercy of these kind of companies and in my experience, they don't do much in the way of mercy.",1,amazon.com

Your Customer Service did not provide any applicable service, since they do not have the ability to process an order over the phone, only view the order and offer upgraded shipping options, which in fact did not improve the arrival date. 5) How does a company this size not have a mechanism do deal with order shortages.",1,amazon.com

The product is called Razor Cuts by Hotstuff. Suddenly it's ""Currently unavailable. We don't know when or if this item will be back in stock"". Here's the review: BEWARE OF BUYING THIS PRODUCT FULFILLED BY AMAZON!!! BEWARE OF BUYING THIS PRODUCT FULFILLED BY AMAZON FOR THE $12.95 PRICE. RECEIVED BOTTLE AND LOOKED FOR EXPIRE DATE, IT WAS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BOTTLE PRINTED ON A STICKER THAT WAS SLITED INTO 4 SECTIONS. I AM FAMILIAR WITH THIS PRODUCT, I HAVE PURCHASED IT IN THE PAST SO I KNOW WHERE THE EXPIRE DATE SHOULD BE. WHERE IT SHOULD BE WAS ON THE EDGE OF THE BOTTLE'S LABEL, BUT COVERING THE EDGE OF THE LABEL THERE WAS A LONG AMAZON LABEL WITH THE NAME OF THE PRODUCT AND AMAZON'S BAR CODE. I PEELED OFF AMAZON'S LABEL TO FIND THE EDGE OF THE BOTTLE'S LABEL HAD BEEN CUT OFF, I COULD SEE THE RAZOR BLADE MARK LEFT ON THE BOTTLE. I PEELED OFF THE STICKER ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BOTTLE TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING UNDER IT, THERE WAS NOTHING. THIS STICKER LABEL SAID EXPIRE DATE 7/18. I CALLED HOTSTUFF AND TALKED TO PAUL, HE VERIFIED WERE THE EXPIRE DATE SHOULD BE...ON THE EDGE OF THE LABEL. SENT IT BACK. I'LL BE SURPRISED IF AMAZON POSTS THIS REVIEW. Paul from Hotstuff ran the lot # on the bottle's label and it's actual expire date is 8/2017....Go figure!

But why did I really stop shopping at Amazon? Because Amazon is the reason why over a million workers (between their business and USPS who delivers for them) do not get to enjoy major holidays like Easter, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day,Thanksgiving, and Christmas with their families - because now they're forced to have to be out delivering for Amazon, which could and should allow ALL deliveries to stop for all major holidays. People survived for hundreds of years not getting mail on major holidays or Sundays. Now USPS workers do not get that one (saving grace) day a week to rest their bodies (Sundays), especially between November and February when they need it the most. Amazon is DIRECTLY responsible for lowering the quality of life and family time and rest time for over a million American workers. And because odd that, I had to quit the USPS and have been unemployed and struggling to find work ever since.

Getting a refund Items 2-4 advertised in stock 3-5 days out when didn't show up I checked and they are now 2 months out. But these can't be cancelled because they already started the process.

2277,"PLACED 42 VORDERS IN 30 DAYS, SAW IST WEEK I WASN'T GOING TO PAY TO SHOP THERE, ENDED UP RETURNING HALF. SO MUCH MISSING OR INCORRECT INFO IN PRODUCT DETAILS, AND SITE VERY HARD TO NAVIGATE, MOST SEARCH ENGINES REQUIRE AT LEAST A TWO WORD HIT TO SHOW AN ITEM WHEN SEARCHING, AMAZON'S SITE USES A ONE WORD HIT. SEARCHED FOR FOLDABLE PLASTIC WORK HORSES, GOT 2,208 HITS, 6 WERE WORK HORSES, 2 WERE PLASTIC. TAKES HOURS TO FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AND THEN THEY HAVE SO MANY RESTRICTIONS ON SHIPPING, PROMO'S, ECT. IT JUST ISN'T FEASIBLE TO USE THEM. AND WHAT OTHER SITE THAT SELLS AT RETAIL OR ABOVE CHARGES TO USE IT? NONE. ONLY REASON I TRIED WAS THE LARGEST AND OLDEST ONLINE SHOPPING SITE HAS BEGUN TO ALLOW 3RD PARTY SELLERS. THE LAST 5 ITEMS I ORDERED THERE CAME FROM AMAZOM, I FIGURED I'D CUT OUT THE MIDDLE MAN, BUT IT'S SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE. I HAVE 73 EMAILS FROM THAT 30 DAY PERIOD FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE, WHERE I HAD TO CALL IN ABOUT PROBLEMS WITH ORDSERS, BEING CHARGED TWICE FOR SAME ORDER, ONCE WHEN PLACED, THENAGAIN WHEN SHIPPED, AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT PENDING CHARGES, BUT CHARGES THAT WERE PROCESSED. NEEDLASS TO SAY, I MADE SURE I GOT ALL ITEMS REURNED BEFORE THE 30 DAYS WERE UP. ANYONE CAN SHOP THERE, BUT YOU DON'T GET THAT 2 DAY FREE SHIPPING. AND NOW THAT THEY CHARGE TAX ON EVERY ORDER, WHICH ID AGAINST THE LAW IN MY STATE, SINCE THEY DON'T HAVE A DISTRIBUTION CENTER WITHIN THE STATE, YOU MIGHT AS WELL BUY LOCALLY. WHEN I ASKED THEY SAID IT WAS FEDERAL LAW. THAT'S A FLAT OUT LIE, SALES TAX LAWS DIFFER FROM STATE TO STATE AS DOES AMOUNT, AND SOME STATES DON'T CHARGE ANY SALES TAX ON EDIBLE GOODS, YET AMAZON COLLECTS ON ALL. BUT THEY CAN'T BE TRUNING IT IN TO THE STATES, JUST ANOTHER WAY TO INCREASE PROFITS. ONE ITEM I ORDERED FROM PRIME, CAME FROM A 3 RD PARTY VENDOR, HE LEFT THE INVOICE IN THE BOX, THE MARK UP WAS 100%, I PAID 48.05, AMAZON PAID 24.67. THEY HAVE NO OVERHEAD BUT THE COST OF THE WEBSITE AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REOS OVER THE PHONE, WHICH IS 70% OUTSOURCED TO MANILLA AND INDIA, ONE AMAZON REP,USA BASED, ADMITTED HE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE MANILA WAS, OR THAT INDIA WAS A COUNTRY, THOUGHT IT WAS THE NAME OF A CONTINENT. AGAIN POORLY TRAINED, SITE DIFFICULT TO USE, TOO MUCH TIME TO RESOLVE ISSUES, AN AVERAGE OF 3 CALLS AND 2 HOURS ON PHONE EVERYTIME. I WENT BACK TO OTHER SITE, NOW I JUST ASK IF THEY HAVE IT IN STOCK, OR A QUESTION ABOUT THE PRODCUT. IF THEY RESPOND ALL THEY KNOW IS WHAT'S LISTED I DON'T BUY FROM THEM. THERE ARE PLENTY OF SELLERS WHO STOCK THEIR OWN ITEMS AND ARE INTERESTED IN CUSTOMER SERVICE TO HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THIS MESS.

When Amazon Prime Day started at 9pm I checked it out and realized that the TV was now being sold for $1000 less than I paid for it. I contacted Amazon to see if I could get some type of refund to compensate for the $1000 difference. They said I would have to repackage the 90 pound TV (box has been broken down) send it back and buy a new TV at the lower price. I am unable to do that as now I have no box and explained to the customer service rep that I don't see how them getting back a now used TV is any smarter than me losing $1000. After speaking to 3 people they refused to budge on their stance. I would have been happy with an $500 credit. I have always been extremely pleased with Amazon's customer service in the past.

Once they advised me to write to the supplier which I did. All this was well within the return window as defined by Amazon. I also posted a review on their website of K-6 and implored Amazon for not responding. My other comment was not posted by Amazon. Since I reported the defective good as soon as it was received by me and since Amazon took NO ACTION, technically I am within my right to still seek a replacement. Upon contacting Amazon Customer Care, I was told that Amazon only advertises the product on its website (???) and that since the window of return is closed, they cannot help me.

They kept insisting I joined, I kept saying I never joined. Stop emailing me. Next I received a product ordered with prime even though I told them to cancel any order associated with prime. From here it became nasty. They are idiots. Amazon needs competition. I fired them. To resolve it, remove any existence of prime to my account. It never existed.

Amazon failed to take proper notes of my case and gave me the run around. 3 weeks later my bank reversed the charge and said from beginning Amazon should have simply refunded me.

In other words, they feel no obligation to make good on my purchases unless I intend to sign up and pay them every month for the right to what I already paid for. Absolutely none of them will give me back what I paid for. So, I will not buy from Amazon again unless they give me back what they took from me. You can count on that Amazon.

Once they were ALL finally listed it took a LONG time with their SLOW SLOW population of my goods before they started to sell. NOW I HAVE MONEY IN MY ACCOUNT THEY WON'T PAY ME. That is because they have no problem at all accepting my MasterCard for payment of ANYTHING they want to sell me but they will not put my profits on the card OR in my bank account. They way that they want me to open a new bank account and get a VISA to be paid. It is the MOST ridiculous way to keep my money that I have EVER heard of!!!

Clearly he needs the money so much more than I do. I will not be replying to any further comments. You have wasted two months of my time, and even e-mailing Jeff Bezos results in no reply.

2353,"If you had asked me to review Amazon.com 2 years ago, I most likely wouldn't have had a bad thing to say about them. For the past year and a half, it has gone so far down hill. I would always order from Amazon and use the Super Saver Shipping, and most of the time, I would get my purchases earlier than the expected delivery date. Once I became an invitee to a Prime membership, I would get my packages in the guaranteed 2 days. Lately, there have been numerous late packages. I would say 9 out of 10 packages are late. When I see ""Guaranteed Delivery"" by a certain date, I absolutely count on that. Especially, if it's a gift for someone. As if late packages weren't bad enough, 8 out of 10 items arrive damaged. It's a shame that the convenience of ordering products from Amazon.com has come with the inconvenience of damaged item returns so frequently. I had asked a representative about accessing Prime music or video through my account, and was told that as a member, I can access it. When it didn't work, I had to speak to someone in music department and was told that as an invitee to Prime, I am not entitled to the free music downloads with my own account. Customer service has been terrible in giving wrong information, and promising replacements the next day that don't arrive, then nonchalantly say that it'll be there the day after. This becomes a problem when you're expecting it that day, and sometimes, even wait for it. 2 years ago, Amazon.com would've gotten 5 stars from me. Being a customer for over 10 years have seen how far down hill they have gone. Their customer service used to be tops, and delivery was always on point. I hate to say it, but Amazon.com truly earned this 1 star for their lack of customer service and not living up to their guarantees.",1,amazon.com
2354,"I used Amazon to purchase most of the items needed for my son's wedding. I had no issue with any of the vendors but one. It was for two sets of engraved dog tags by TagZ. Both sets engravings were wrong and had two different dates, neither of which were the actual wedding date. Since they arrived too late to return we had no way of replacing them and they just had to be tossed out. When Amazon sent me the email to review the different products I had purchased they accepted ALL EXCEPT the review for this company stating that they arrived late, vendor did not reply to email sent, and the engraving was wrong on both of them. BEWARE of the reviews on Amazon as they are very selective of which one they will allow to be posted. The only thing in their guidelines that they sent me for why they could have possibly denied my review is that the purchase must be $50 or mores. The irony is most of the other purchase they had me review for the same event were all under $50 but as they were mostly positive it seems that was the criteria used as to which ones they allowed to be posted and which one they denied to post.",1,amazon.com

So I spent 15 minutes going through the house looking for essentials to order. Another 15 minutes was spent finding ones I actually could add top my cart because half of them had a prime only button. So now, we're a half hour in on what should be a pretty simple and FAST ordering process. My cart finally shows I qualify for free shipping, so I hit the checkout button... and voila, there's a 14.95 charge for shipping! Well, if I've got to pay for shipping I might as well just order the couple of items I really needed, right? WRONG. Amazon no longer has delete buttons next to each of the items in your shopping cart... not even one to clear the entire list to start over!!!

A week later I started getting emails saying customers wanted to know why I had sent their purchases to the wrong address, After that I started getting notices from Amazon, they would be charging my account for the 48+ refunds. Fortunately, my gut told me to cancel the accounts associated with the account a week earlier and I acted on it. I once had a seller account in 2007 but stopped using it because the only sales I made were from fraudulent accounts. I guess the hackers knew how to activate it. I have called several times and have been assured the account has been sent to their ""tech"" department. I have only spoken to 1 person who spoke English as their first language. Most of the other folks I spoke with were Chinese or Indian and could care less what was going on. I have tried to explain I have the name of the store name the hackers are using but I am them told they can't add anything to my case once it's been sent to ""tech"" but ""tech"" would be getting back to me...it's been 9 days now and I'm pretty sure I won't be hearing from them anytime soon, if at all. I do have an email that states I do not have a sellers account with Amazon but no other details and it ends with asking me to email them at the enclosed link if I have any questions or concerns. I clicked on it and it goes to the logon page which of course, I can no longer click on. I am worried I will be prosecuted for something I have not done. I am also worried I will be sued for the refund amounts since they are not able to charge any of the accounts I had attached to it.  My advice, DON'T USE AMAZON. It's not worth it. Buy and sell your products elsewhere, you'll be glad you did.",1,amazon.com

I called up the customer rep and was told that someone will call be back within 2 days. No one ever called. I repeated the above about 5 times. No one ever got back to me. I thought that my account got hacked and sent a letter directly to Amazon UK. Just like with the phone calls, they didn't bother to respond. It became obvious that the company has something to hide. I have a reason to believe that I was a victim of discrimination and they don't want to admit that so I can't sue them.  I spoke to a lawyer about the whole thing and I requested copy of my documents via letter. They refused to provide me with information whom should I address in that letter (so called data controller) which is already an offence in the EU. I got it somehow and sent a letter but just like before they ignored it (offence number two: they're legally obliged to respond within 40 days) I had to use legal letter to get ANY response. Their response was that they wouldn't give me anything until I verify my ID. So I did. Now they request a copy of my lease :D I believe I'm on something here. A company that doesn't have anything to hide doesn't act like that so I will continue my journey.

Associates are running around having to beat their time instead of focusing on getting the job done in a safe manner. The store only had 2 days without injury which speaks for itself. On my first day, an associate was bleeding from his cheek. Injuries range from knee, arm, head, foot, etc. Working conditions are not what they are suppose to be like for human beings. Vending machines are broken in order to get proper PPE (e.g. gloves, glove liners). I am canceling my Amazon Prime membership and never buying from Amazon again. Working conditions are disgusting. Being fast should not be what is important, SAFETY is what is important. Amazon would not be the world's most ""customer-centric company"" without its associates. One can't even utilize the restroom unless they are on break or lunch, because it affects their time, and management will take note of it, so additionally employees must also train their bladder. Sad. To the CEO Mr. Bezos: Instead of having employees yell ""CORNER"" and ""CROSSING"" when moving along the aisles, you would benefit from not timing employees like they are animals fetching, and concentrate on a humane work environment that is safe for all.

They ask us to submit blank documents! They ask us to send them documents using fax, instead of email!

The representative I spoke to was in a rush to get me off the phone and lied to me telling me that I got the reward dollars. But I just got my Sears credit card statement and it shows that they took all my reward points and charged me full price for my items. I may just cancel my account with them. I don't like thieves or liars,1,amazon.com
2391,"This is the first time I've ever had a complaint about Amazon.  The #AmazonPrime payment process is ridiculous and borderline unethical. I went in to pay through the student page so that I can see the student price. It didn't come up when I hit ""continue,"" nor was there a button or drop arrow to get the student discount. There was no breakdown of payment or ""confirm payment"" button, as there usually is, so I hit continue and was informed that I was signed up for #Amazon Prime. THEN I got a notification from my credit card company that $105 had been charged to my account. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. WHEN YOU SAY ""THE FIRST HOWEVER-MANY-MONTHS IS FREE,"" THAT MEANS YOU DO NOT PAY UNTIL THAT FREE PERIOD IS OVER. THAT IS HOW IT WORKS WITH EVERY PAYMENT PROGRAM. Additionally, nowhere does it SAY that we will be charged immediately.",1,amazon.com

2395,"I madde a purchase from Amazon on 12/14. now i have been purchasing from Amazon for years and never had a problem. I was not aware at the time of the purchase that this item was coming from an individual. My order gets updated on 12/15 with a bogus tracking number and the status has not changed since 12/15. I contact Amazon and all I get is you will have to contact the seller and wait 1-2 weeks for a refund. I have contacted the seller several times and there is no phone number and you can only email them. Amazon still will not take responsibility for scammers on their site. When my account was debited it shows Amazon. But they are saying that they gave the money to the seller and will not refund me because the item has been shipped. Even though they can see that the tracking number is not valid on the USPS site. They have no records of the tracking number. The has been the worst experience ever. And all they keep saying is that we cant refund you and this is the only order that you have placed. I guess because they are under the assumption that I have only placed one order they dont care. We have over 10 accounts with them because everyone in my house has their own account. So with that being said I guess because this account only shows 1 Im not important to them. And yes all of my accounts have prime membership and on top of that its not the free trial. Its a paid subscription. They have people who get on the phones and claim to be managers of the company and when you call back for them no one knows who they are. I also think that thats unfair to lie to your customers to get them off the phone. I have given them nothing but good reviews in the past but after this I will never think to use them again. Everyone be very careful of what you purchase on this site. Because its not up to Amazon to give you a refund its up to the seller. So if your item ships and you never get it you will wait forever for a refund and to think this was a Christmas Gift. And yes my money is very precious to me when I work for it everyday.

2397,"I am amazon.com user for a long time but I was just a buyer. for last 7 months I start to sell on amazon. I already have experience selling on ebay and couple other sites. First it was looking just wonderfull. I sell new cases for tablet pc and other staff but in used directory. Because you can't sell on amazon new staff without official license from manufacturer. But then I sold used Canon digital camera and my account was stopped for a while. With all my money on it - there was 112euro. Amazon explain it so: I violate intellectual property of Canon. When I asked how could this be when I was selling USED CANON CAMERA!? there where no answer. then after 2 weeks I received letter that amazon decide to close my seller account. Ok. But I ask them to withdraw my balance to my bank account. They told me - that it going to happen automatically. 3 month later - nothing. No money no connection with amazon - because my account is already closed so I can't enter it and withdraw my money by my self. All I hear from amazon: if you have a problem contact us directly from your account. When I explain my problem they advice my to login and contact them directly from my seller account. So amazon.com for me is just another global fraudsters with huge money which they've stolen from persons like me. without any explanations. I understand that maybe there where reason for closing my seller account but my money which was hold for stuff I sold are still mine! And I am not Santa, at least not for amazon!",1,amazon.com

I found this company to be an absolute nightmare every time I published a book. Your formatting will always be wrong and your book will look terrible even if you use their own software. They will accuse you of copyright infringement and reject your book over and over. Sure I sold a few books, but I don't think it was worth the aggravation. I would advise you to look elsewhere. The last straw for me came when they started rejecting images. Not content but images from an online source that offers freely available content.

2401,"I bought a Grundig Satellit 750 Radio from Amazon, when it arrived in Bago City Philippines the shorwave did not work.  I had been warned that Amazon will often ship defective items to people who will have difficulties returning these!  I could not afford the $100 out of pocket after spending so much for this radio (plus customs and shipping) $558.59. Amazon did not offer to reimburse me for the total costs to ship the item back to them DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE ITEM WAS DEFECTIVE (offering only up to $20.00 of it). So since the AM/FM works I decided to keep this DEFECTIVE RADIO! Well due to the fact that our voltage is 220V here, I ordered a power cord for this radio from Super Power Supply and according to Amazon it was shipped via DHL but when I contacted DHL they said it was shipped via Global Mail ( REGULAR MAIL) but I paid $18.00 for this item to be shipped here via DHL EXPRESS! I then went online to write a scathing review of this product and received this""Your review could not be posted."" According to Amazon's TOS... This is the copy of that review. ""Buyer Beware SCAM ALERT! I live in the Philippines and paid Amazon to ship this to my home address. According to Amazon it was shipped by DHL. According to DHL this item went Global Mail! I have not received the package. I can not ask for a refund due to the fact that I can't send back a package that I have not received! I have asked them to send another one but I doubt that this company will. I paid $18.00 with shipping and customs! This was not CHEAP SHIPPING! Yet this company decided to ship it via regular Philippines Post and lie and say that DHL shipped it! Do not trust this company! I have not received the item. I have waited a very long time to write this. I wrote a review earlier (thinking it was with DHL due to Amazon but this review is about the fact that it WAS NOT SENT VIA DHL) I guess we can't trust AMAZON either! Since their site says it was shipped via DHL!  We encourage you to revise your review and submit it again. A few common issues to keep in mind:  Your review should focus on specific features of the product and your experience with it. Feedback on the seller or your shipment experience should be provided at www.amazon.com/feedback. We do not allow profane or obscene content. This applies to adult products too. Advertisements, promotional material or repeated posts that make the same point excessively are considered spam. Please do not include URLs external to Amazon or personally identifiable content in your review."" This review you will notice does not have any foul language in it, other than mentioning Amazon several times and my expectation that when they say they shipped something via DHL that it actually is shipped via DHL and not REGULAR MAIL!. You can not trust Amazon. They will send you broken items that cost you hundreds of dollars due to the fact that you would not wish to trust them, or pay the very high return shipping costs! But also they say that they ship a item via a carrier and it turns out to be a LIE! Do not trust these two companies!   There are very few companies that allow one the selection Amazon does and for me and others who are living in a foreign country (I'm from the USA) a company like this is very useful. But when they send a radio as they did me, that is DEFECTIVE and which I paid such a large sum for, and then only offer $20 to return it...well enough said(?) Do not trust Amazon with expensive purchases. Do not trust the company I bought the cord from, as it was not the correct cord and was not shipped by DHL but by regular mails which has a history of theft here! Ok? So that is all I have to say about this.",1,amazon.com

2414,"So, my Kindle Voyager died that I purchased in Feb. 2015. I jump on chat, they take me through the paces, and decide it can't be fixed. What do you mean it can't be fixed? It's just a dead battery. Oh, we can't fix hardware problems. Okay, well, I'm not paying $199 retail for a brand new one, so, what can you do? Answer: $20 off a new one. NOPE! I call, speak with a guy named Arthur. I explain everything, and he says not to worry; which immediately made me suspicious. I tell him I need to purchase it on a payment plan after he tells me he's selling me the new device for $100. He says he'll give me $40 credit to be used as the first payment, and put $59.99 in my account to be used to make subsequent payments. I made him explain this 3 times. He kept saying not to worry, and he'd send me an email with all the details and his name ... just purchase the device, and he'll do all these things on his end. So, I do it and wait for the email. I get the email, and it says $159.99 for the device with payments to begin the first month and his name is missing. Now, all the messed up crap begins. I decide they lie over the phone, so I start a chat. The woman is a moron and can't understand what I said happened during the transaction on the previous day. We go around and around, and then she then says she found $59.99 sitting in promotional credits and can't be applied to payments. WHAT? What does that mean? It means the $59.99 can only be used for future purchases. I tell her that's not right, and someone needs to fix this. She passes me onto someone else who says he will refund $59.99 to my card. Hours have past, and it's like 1am. I'm so tired at this point, I'm almost falling asleep. I tell him to do so, and I'll check back the next day. I check my account & emails the next day, and nothing happened. I'm saving some of these chats since amazon.com conveniently doesn't allow you to save them. I call to speak with a supervisor, and I'm already tired and frustrated. I get passed around, put on hold for 45 minutes, and hang up. I call back and get hung up on at least 5 times. Now, I'm steaming mad. I'm back to chats since people are jerking me around over the phone. I tell them someone needs to fix this, redo the payment schedule so that the device is $100 like Arthur promised me it would be. I get passed around some more. I ask to speak with a supervisor, and I'm absolutely sure I wasn't speaking with a supervisor who blew me off. Every month, I'm chatting with people, pasting previous chats in the window from Word documents, and asking them what they plan to do. I get the device, and one of them tells me to send it back and they'll redo everything for $100. I ask him if he thinks I'm stupid, because everybody is saying something different and now I don't trust any of them. Send me an email saying this is what would happen if I send it back. He says no, which makes me know he's lying too. In September, I file a BBB complaint. Whoever answered refunds $41 because they took so long, I bought some mp3's which reduced the credit, and before I could ask about redoing the payment schedule, the BBB closes the case. So, I enter another BBB complaint about that. Nothing happens. I get into another chat whereby that rep says he will have someone from the BBB division of Amazon.com address the complaint. Nothing happens again after a couple of weeks. So, then I enter in a complaint with the Attorney General of the State of Washington ... Seattle. Someone at Amazon.com sends back a double-talking response without addressing the payment plan ... again. The Attorney General's office says there's nothing they can do and to go to small claims court for resolution. I send back an email with ALL the chats attached and tell them I've been deceived, and small claims court where? Washington? I don't think so! These people act like this isn't an online company and the laws of one State can govern the laws of another. So, now Amazon.com decides to deactivate my device on 10/7/16 so it can't get any books online. Fine with me! It's their money they're losing out on, not mine. And for what? Just so they can do and say whatever they want to and not do right by me? I'm in dire straights, and they keep sending emails saying they want to take $80 from my card, instead of $40 twice and one payment of $20. I've spent thousands of dollars with Amazon.com on various products over at least 10 years, and they dare treat people like this and make me out to be a liar about the whole thing? I tell them if they were paying me by the hour, with all the hours, days, months I've spent trying to get them to do the right thing, the device would be paid for by now. My time is money too! Nobody is a consumer advocate for online businesses, and a company as large as Amazon.com thinks it can do whatever they want. I think I've also written the FTC ... not sure ... but, they're another useless organization who does nothing about anything. Companies are running rip-shod over consumers, and are being held accountable for NOTHING! They're a monopoly, and there's almost no way around purchasing things online without going through Amazon.com. I'm disgusted and definitely looking for other options to help with this. Any ideas, folks?",1,amazon.com

And if you call a third time it only get worse.  It is even worse if you bought the item from a third party vendor and not Amazon itself. Amazon's listings are the worst for product information. Then if you call Amazon for further info on a given product the phone reps have no idea about product info beyond what's on the screen in the listing.,1,amazon.com

But I am frustrated by the lack of professionalism and double standards Amazon has when reviewing submitted campaign text. I don't mind my add being rejected because of grammar errors etc..I'm not that good in that department sometimes. (Or text that is sexually explicit.)  But when my add is rejected for a few words that implied affection and desire by my two main characters. I thought you have to be kidding! I did my research prior to submitting my new campaign. And checked out what other author's add text said....far worse than mine! However these particular authors were making Amazon alot of money. I'm Not! Double standards! Unprofessional! I contacted the review team via the support comment box and I was told each campaign text is reviewed on a case by case basis. And my add was declined for its implied sexual content. Hmm so if you make Amazon loads of money you get preferential treatment. And you can say whatever you want. The sexually descriptive text I read when researching on Amazon book site was very racy.

Have never downloaded an app, I block cookies, but they do it anyway... Earlier this year I wanted to research a small subculture in India, when suddenly a popup appeared from Amazon telling me they could sell me both a book and DVD about the group. I called, complained. They adamantly refused to tell me how to get rid of Amazon's installation, told me to call Apple. Once in a while, I accidentally touch something on the tablet's keyboard and a long, vertical popup appears in lavender print, entirely in alphas aand numerics except for one word at the top: Amazon. So firstly there is this violation of privacy and secondly, why would I pay more plus shipping for the same thing I can get from a brick and mortar mom and pop locally? I would never buy enough to want Prime, and they lost my patronage when I found out they spy on all my online activities. It was creepy. They charged more for that present than the local store, and charged more for shipping than if I did it myself. I can't even go there to see what merchants sell, and then go directly to that merchant, because Amazon tracks me everywhere, apparently. It was their stubborn refusal to tell me how to eject them from my tablet that concerns me. By the way... I just phoned Amazon to tell them that I am starting to warn people online about their invasion of privacy, and the first person that answered is a Filipino... I demanded to speak to an American that I could understand without a Creole accent.

I do have Prime and love using their music app. I also like the movie and tv show apps and I even have a Fire Stick which is side loaded. Customer service about order issues is great.  As for shipping, I'm literate enough to understand that if something may not be in stock or that it may not be sorted into the warehouse yet and that there may be a delay and shipping times start when the packages ship. If I am not a Prime member then I won't receive as fast of shipping because I can't get faster shipping than those who pay for the faster shipping option. That would make no sense! I know that a package isn't late until the expected delivery date has passed. Amazon can shipping the day before the expected delivery date and still get it on time many times. I know to double check the expected delivery date on the checkout screen as that will show me the date and if I choose to procede, that means I accept that day. It does not mean I see the date but hope it arrives sooner and if it doesn't I throw a fit. Also, this delivery date will tell me if a third party seller is in another country. If the expected delivery date is a range of 2 weeks 3 weeks out, it is not in my country. Amazon does have some add on only items. These will only be able to be purchased with orders over $25 sold and fulfilled by Amazon. It can include all add on only items. These items aren't big sellers and cause losses by making them available to be a single item delivery. Instead of increasing the price, they offer it as an add on item. Would you drive 20 miles to the store to purchase a pack of gum? Most add on only items have a list of other sellers on the right hand side. These are either higher priced or have a shipping fee. Sometimes the add on only item will ship by itself if it's in a different warehouse than the other items. This doesn't make the add on only feature a waste. That means the entire order made shipping and handling it not be a loss for them. The rest of their customer service departments are not helpful. Reports aren't taken seriously and often ignored.  They allow abuse in their forums and also allow some very nasty posts to be posted as well as bullying and public shaming while removing the dumbest of things. There is a group of nasty, dirty, hateful old ladies and a some men that think these women are the fake photos they share who spend their entire day looking for reviews to make fun of. They then share them on the forums so others can go look and downvote that reviewer. They write nasty comments on the reviews and Amazon allows it. People should not be afraid to write reviews. Other forums are fool of the most disgusting posts with inappropriate language and subjects. Amazon allows in even though it looks horrible on their behalf. Is it that their reps don't understand English enough to know that eating poo isn't an appropriate topic. Also, Amazon allows fake profiles that are attacking sellers and products for no good reason. They write rude questions and reviews even though they don't own the products. With heaps of evidence sent to them, they still let these nutjobs play on Amazon. Lastly, Amazon is removing reviews and reviewing privileges of people they believe are violating their TOS but many people never violate their TOS and lose their reviews while people obviously violating their TOS and having been reported countless times are free to write their garbage reviews. Amazon priorities are a total crapshoot. After my Prime membership is up I am going to be cutting ties with Amazon because I won't be out anything. I can get my items elsewhere with no problem. They have gotten their priorities so out of whack lately and out sourcing their employees isn't helping them with these issues as they don't understand English when you contact them.",1,amazon.com

You really have to take their advice with a huge grain of salt.  As a buyer, I have experienced situations when I ordered an item of a certain color but received a different color with an explanation that they were out of stock on the color #1. That color however still was listed up for sale, even though being out of stock. Amazon doesn't care. So it just wasn't working, and I requested my account closed.

You used to get everything in 2 days if you ordered by a certain time at the day. U see something like order by this time and get it by the day. That was always accurate. Now I always get super slow prime items, one recently ordered on a tuesday for a flash drive took until monday. and frequently my items take 4 days etc. these are not 3rd party sellers because i try to only buy from amazon directly to get the fastest shipping. they just simply arent fast or any good anymore or most importantly reliable. the worst part is before they used to try to be nice and give 1 month prime extensions and ive had people offer me 10 dollar refunds multiple times or the extensions but this was a long time ago. now they only make excuses and never do anything to make sure I am satisfied about my prime shipments being extremely late. I've exported my amazon purchases on my account and added them on excel and have spent like almost 10k dollars and you would think they would at least allow me to not have to pay 100 for this joke service on top of that. i do not recommend prime to anyone. if u are looking for 2 day shipping its not here. they do not care if u get it in 2 days or not and frequently u wont. could be 5 business days like mine took.",1,amazon.com
2444,"Wow, what a piece of trash this so called site has become. I just closed my 17+ year old account out of disgust. My problem, the fake reviews, so called vine program, and tons of fake ass nonsense Amazon has going on. I got an email from at least one honest person at Amazon referring to""testing"" certain accounts and voting features of ""certain accounts"". Which was part of my complaint.  Then after all of this started they started deleting some of my reviews without even telling me! Not letting me edit my reviews. Things got completely stupid with how they were manipulating my account, and maintained the ENTIRE time they were not. I keep chuckling at one of my phone calls in the middle of this sh!tshow. This guy kept saying, I'm going to hang up if you don't stop swearing. But I had not sworn. Normally my talk is peppered with extremely colorful language, to say it sweetly. So I very clearly am aware while talking to any support person about my language. F##king idiot.  Basically there is some major BS going on and when I directly called them out they continued to lie and tell me to clear my cache, and other insults to my intelligence, not to mention my email PROOF ACKNOWLEDGING they were doing something. I got nowhere with the BBB complaint. So I finally closed my very old account out of pure digust and frustration.  My advice, run every product URL through fakespot.com first before purchasing anything else! Will save some major headaches, but unfortunately not all.

2445,"I am a Prime Amazon Member. I ordered a new $1300.00 TV that I found on Amazon which was promised to be delivered ""next day"" on July 6, 2016. The date was updated to July 7, 2016 online when I checked the status online. I called and was told that it would definitely be delivered on July 7th and that Amazon would refund my next day shipping. I waited all day on July 7th for the TV. The TV never arrived. I went online and it said that it was coming by MAIL and that it was in transit! I called Amazon and asked how in the world could they guarantee ANYTHING sent by MAIL to be delivered the following day...and how could they send something so expensive and fragile BY MAIL? They had no answer. The agent put me on hold and said that she would call the USPS about the delivery. She came back online and said that she had spoken with the USPS and had been told it would be delivered by 3:00 p.m. She told me that she would call me back at 4:00 p.m. to confirm the delivery. At 4:20 p.m., I had no TV and no call from Amazon. So, I called Amazon. All the agent could tell me was that, in checking his tracking information, he could see the TV was ""in transit."" I told him that I KNEW that much as I could see it when I looked myself. He told me at that point that the TV would ""probably come tomorrow or the next day."" I told him that I had reserved a man to come out to mount my TV based upon Amazon's ""guarantee"" and all he could say was, ""I'm sorry. I know you are frustrated."" At that point I told him to cancel the order and I would go to Best Buy and get the TV there for the same price. He told me that he canceled the order. I also told him to cancel my Prime Membership as well. I am done with Amazon and their delivery ""guarantee"" days which, obviously, mean nothing at all.  UPDATE: The Amazon Representative did not cancel the orde and it arrived the next day by mail carrier. I refused the delivery as I had already purchased the same TV from Best Buy the night before. The ironic thing about that was when the mailed TV arrived, the guy was at my home mounting the one I had bought at Best Buy! I'm still waiting for my refund from Amazon on my credit card of over $1300.00 and filed a dispute with AMEX just in case. Amazon says it can take up to two weeks to get the money refunded as returning the TV can take that long to get to them. They did give me $100.00 on my AMEX as a ""goodwill"" gesture for all the issues with this order. The Amazon representative also did not cancel my Prime as I had asked them to do. I seriously think that their representatives say ""Yes!"" To just about everything and understand very, very little English.",1,amazon.com

Our reviews were favorable because the book is very well written, and a lot of fun. However, Amazon chose to delete both our reviews because they deemed them to be ""too favorable.""

The ""free shipping"" now is also obfuscated: It used to be at the top, now is in with ""Free Shipping! - (if you get our credit card)"". ""Amazon Pantry"" as well--what is that? Complicated. Sometimes I choose an item and it comes up in the cart that I ordered two (no, I didn't click twice). Sneaky. Don't like it at all. Used to be simple and quick. B.

Free shipping was $25 minimum order, then $35, now--apparently--$49. D. Aren't so great to their employees, from what I understand. I always look for an alternative (B&H for electronics, for instance). E. Amazon-shipped items still pretty reliable, but I have had increasing problems with outside store orders. Seems like they don't vet the stores so well anymore. I notice that many Amazon-affiliated stores are rated badly by Resellerratings. F.

2470,"Since January of 2014 to date, March 2016, we have placed 207 orders with Amazon. It has been, until now, an extraordinarily good experience. We have a great deal of respect for Mr. Bezos and what he has done. This particular experience, however, was awful! I thought that, since we had faired so well, maybe a larger item would work too; so, we ordered this Samsung dishwasher with installation and removal of the old washer. Words fail me. I had planned to aggregate all of the failures and miscommunications of this transaction like some prosecutor in a courtroom for others to read, but I am tired of thinking of it. So, here goes with an unstudied, less calculated recap: from the inception of the order we received multiple e-mailed correspondence as to the delivery of the product and the delivery of the ordered installation from at least four disparate sources. There have been at least six different business entities and Amazon agents involved in the entire process: (i) Plessers, whoever that is; (ii) AM Home Installation, or something like that; (iii) Amazon, of course, who by the way disavow any responsibility once the money has changed hands, choosing rather to turn both the work and all appeals for help over to various other amorphous agencies; (iv) Nathan at 800.344.4856 I have no idea how I came to be in touch with him, but at least to his credit he revealed surprise at how the order had aged; (v) some man from New York named Miguel Santos, who reluctantly later identified his agency as Infinite Installations and himself as customer service agent for Amazon, that I talked to with no good outcome (At one point, Mr. Santos sent me an e-mail with an Amazon telephone number to call for customer service; it turned out to be a non-working number); and not least (vi) the named agent now representing Amazon for the claim. From the beginning delivery was promised in the e-mails, but the installation dates supplied by each mail preceded the delivery date stipulated in the respective communication! In an e-mailed response, I asked how you could install a product not yet delivered, but never got an answer to that or any other question. With each mail, the delivery-install dates kept changing, each time with an install date which post-dated the delivery date! Finally, this AM company arrived 5 hours beyond the promised four hour window. I let the guy come into my home with the machine. He was clearly harried and seemed uncertain of himself. He brought the new machine into my home, banging our custom front door as he entered. When the subject of removal of the old dishwasher came up, the guy said they were not responsible for removal of the old washer. NOTE: THIS WAS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE AGREEMENT WE ENTERED WITH AMAZON! I then refused delivery and asked him to leave our home. At first he wouldnt leave. I insisted that he go. Miserable experience! The left hand seemed not to know that the right hand even existed, much less what it was doing. They have now charged us $600 and left us to deal with another third party for ostensible resolution, bringing the total of different involved parties to at least six. To anyone who might say to us that we should have known better, this is Amazon, we would say, you are absolutely right. We should have known better. We know now. Small purchases have been great for us, and we will continue to buy these items; we will avoid complex buys in the future, however simply they are presented. P.S. I was interested in seeing what kind of response we might get from other Amazon customers. In the main, I agree with what I have read: for small items, Amazon is great! Could not agree more fully. Thus far, however, no one has shared an experience substantially similar to ours that went well for them. Buying a $1200 dishwasher and having it installed in your home is not like buying a small commodity. Our experience was confusing and very disappointing. Amazon did not act as a third party overseeing the process to ensure good service. This is simply not true. P.S. (160407) We have the final disposition of this matter. We originally paid Amazon $1,131.00; of that amount Amazon returned to us $1,083.40, keeping $226.20. Post-Script #3 (160503) Before finding SiteJabber and making this post, I tried to first post this review on Amazon. Someone who did not identify themselves denied the review; their only comment lay in the following excerpt with quotation marks outlying:  ""We have a great deal of respect for Mr. Bezos and what he has done."" The intimation from this censor(s) seemed to be, we only accept complimentary reviews, seemingly suggesting that it would be ok for me to say nice things about them. That response set me on this quest.",1,amazon.com

When I was on a buyer could open up a case for say a defective product, but he opened up 3 cases for the same product and got me kicked off because it made my defect numbers too high, So if your an Amazon seller be very careful not to make them your only distribution channel as if and when they kick you off they wont even answer your messages. To add insult to injury then they hold your money owed to you hostage for at least a month to 6 weeks before they will release it. I say avoid Amazon as they compete against their sellers as well. Did you know you cannot leave feedback for Amazon the company when you buy something direct from them? Its no surprise because they dont want you leaving them bad feedback, sounds like a double standard to me.",1,amazon.com

2480,"Twice I've received used merchandise (directly) from Amazon.com, when it was supposed to be new. In a recent case, Amazon sent a used, defective backup camera system for Recreational Vehicle (RV), then replaced it with a 2nd defective unit. The instructions were useless. I cobbled together one working unit and returned the non-working parts. I installed the unit on my RV, which involved drilling holes in the body. Then I discovered that the camera had a condensation problem that arose whenever the camera was on for more than 15 seconds. I tried to contact the company (Ducooler and Xie Ju Ming) but their website was inactive. You can type them a support email, but you can never send it :-(  . Amazon agreed to take back the 2nd unit. When I sent it to Amazon, they charged me a $15.20 ""restocking fee"".  This is blatant fraud, as the unit was defective. Clearly Amazon intends to send it to yet another victim. Perhaps they hope that someone will pay for it, be confused by it, and not return it. Fraud, Fraud, Fraud.  I replied to the Amazon email telling me that they were ""restocking"" it, but it bounced. Their email wasn't even signed by a person. I disputed the insufficient refund with the credit card company and have no doubt that the dispute will stick, given the circumstances. Huge amount of time spent; some phone calls over 1 hour. Many emails sent. Bottom line is: Avoid Amazon.com, and if you do receive used merchandise instead of new merchandise, return it immediately.

The qualifying items were considerably more expensive than other sellers had them for, and I ended up spending a lot more than I wanted and I ended up with a DVD that will not play on US players. Just recently, I tried to sell a few things on amazon. I couldn't log into my seller account and had to sign up for a professional account which costs $39 a month. I didn't know I could sign up for an individual account and sell my items that way. Long story short, I HAD to deactivate my account because I didn't have the correct tax or business info to have a professional account. Now I can't sell on amazon again unless I create a new account. I can't even cancel/terminate my existing account without contacting customer service. I can't even find the number to contact them to do so.

Based on my experience they seem to turnaround returned goods (which may have been returned for being defective another reason to avoid buying from there) and resell them without checking them out first.  I bought a Asus Flip chromebook, used like new (just described the condition of the box claiming it was unopened) but right after I took it out of the box the computer acted strangely. It was scroll, font would change size, picture would shake without me even touching it!! I started a return request stating that it was defective and gave all the above reasons and stated that it was like it was possessed and I was afraid of it!  I usually don't check my invoices just expecting them to get it right on the refund, but for some reason I DID check and saw that they charged me the return shipping and changed the reason for return from defective product (where customer does NOT get charged for the return) to buyer wanted to return reason (where you DO get charged.) I immediately notified Amazon and they refunded the charges but even though you can see how many stars the ""warehouse' gets you can NOT read the reviews at to why, you click onto that it just brings you to an Amazon fact page unlike the private sellers where you can read what the customers say about them and AW's rating is NOT high, 84%. The only review that you can see me write was about the product itself, so I would advise NOT EVER to buy ANYthing from Amazon Warehouse, if you buy it used, buy from private seller.",1,amazon.com
2491,"I've enjoyed many years of great service with Amazon. The few minor problems I've encountered through the years were solved fast and efficiently by their Customer Support Team. Free standard shipping during this time was 5 to 7 days. It seems that with the introduction of ""Prime"" free standard shipping now takes 7 to 12 days. The last three items I've ordered took the proverbial slow boat to Missouri. One package took 5 days to get from Texas to Missouri. Then while tracking the package it was delayed for 5 days at a facility close to me. A helpful Amazon Rep had it delivered the next day. Ink for my printer has taken 7 days to get halfway from California to Missouri! I could walk faster than that! My impression is that those of us that use free shipping will be penalized.

I called customer service to request why it was available 2 weeks ago and why I'm just now finding out about this being cancelled. The SUPERVISOR said sorry the orders are based on priority and told me to reorder it through another seller, and hope that I receive it by Christmas, after I explained this was not an issue she stated she attempted to call a 3rd party vendor to get one directly shipped to me. But all she really did was disconnect the phone after an hour and 20 mins waiting with multiple hold times. This was shocking to have happen, but even more shocking is that when I called right back I was just told that I could reorder it and get a gift card. As this is their issue I feel like they need to reorder it at no cost to me and send it next day. The resolution was to close my account with amazon. This was the most poor customer service I have ever received. I will no longer do business AMAZON. Amazon is horrible at resolving in customers favor, even when they know that they are dead wrong.

However, it was going to cost me $10 to get it. Doesn't make sense, right? Well, you can only use one credit at a time. So that means I can only use $5 to buy the $10 item.

I had spent hours on Amazon's site trying to add and then order a gift for an online friend who's address is known to Amazon via their wish list, in fact I had already ordered one item that was delivered so I couldn't understand why I could not get their site to work a second time. When I finally spoke to someone in customer service from the ""wish list"" department I was told that I can not add something to someone's wish list and send it to them. If that is the case, why do they even allow consumers to add ""gift ideas"" to the friend's wish list profile if you can't buy them? They told me it was because the recipient might want to return the gift, but I'm the customer, not the gift recipient. It's my money and I am buying a gift, not an item the recipient can return and get money in return. The only rationale I can think of is due to sending inappropriate gifts, however I was trying to send a Teddy Bear for a friend, to help in a trying time. Amazon's employee had ZERO interest in trying to understand. Stupid policy is what we have so we're going to follow it. That should be their Slogan. What is perhaps most ironic about the email I received from Amazon in response to my complaint is the last line of Amazon's email: ""Your feedback is helping us build Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company."" This has to be the biggest lie I've seen advertised by a company in years. What an absolutely horrible company to do business with.",1,amazon.com

The policy is to get order, have Amazon charge the credit card, and THEN send you a email informing the customer that there is no warranty and no returns on the defective junk they are going to ship you. Amazon will tell you, they can not or will not help you. Woot could care less, they have 100's of complaints and are proud of the fact that they do not even look at them, let lone respond. Amazon will ""refund and charge back"" if it is a out side vendor, when it involves a company they own their policy is to send a automated email telling you to go away",1,amazon.com

2535,"I have shopped Amazon many times and have always been happy with it. I also sometimes have to rely on online shopping like Amazon because I am still recovering from cancer, and am not always able to jump in the car and drive a half hour to a major chain store to get what I need. So when I tried the new Prime Pantry I had high expectations of what it's quality would be, and was hopeful in it being a good resource for me. I ordered items that were canned and items in boxes, that I would normally buy in the grocery store, and thought I was getting a deal with such a decent price, but when I received my box of items I was really disappointed. First of all, the cans were almost all dented. Not normally a big deal, but there was never any mention of denting on the site, and Amazon is usually particular about making an honest accounting of the condition of items. The cans were packed loosely into the box with the boxes of food and pasta so they caused plenty of damage while getting bounced around by the postal service. The shipping box was split into 2 sides, but the cans were scattered so there were several on both sides so NONE of the boxed food was safe from damage. Some items were so damaged that they were leaking, and had to be thrown out. Since the service, Prime Pantry, shows you how full a box is when you are ordering, I was confused why there was so much looseness in the shipping box, when the service said the box was 99% full, when I ordered. I have alerted them to my disappointment, and they refunded my money in full. However, this service is not one that I am eager to give another try. I told Amazon that I would rather shop at the grocery store, and spend extra money, than use this service again and roll the dice on what I may have to throw out from damage. I do not want to go through this every time I get a box from them that is packed like the people working there are living brain donors. Who wants to deal with that?!",1,amazon.com

On the other hand, most of the product ratings and reviews at Amazon's website are obviously phony, superficial and meaningless. So much for integrity, which just isn't part of Amazon.com. And, if a product you buy at Amazon harms you, you will learn that Amazon will take no responsibility for the material nondisclosures that caused you to erroneously buy the harmful product, and they will laugh and sneer at your injury. That's how egregiously arrogant the Amazon employees/ownership really are. They claim to be the Largest Online Retailer in North America, but just don't ask them to be accountable! Goodness, Amazon.com takes all the praise and none of the problems. So, just hope you don't get harmed by anything you buy at Amazon. By the way, Amazon knows the product reviews and ratings are mostly fake and phony. I wonder how many of the reviewers for Amazon on SiteJabber are fakes. When I read a review that is shallow and superficial and just says ""Amazon is wonderful""/5 stars, I know it's fake. According to Amazon, even though you believe they are selling you the product on their website, taking your money, handling the order, guaranteeing the order and within the chain of sellers, they are not the seller, so they fraudulently justify their own lies that they have absolutely no obligation or responsibility.",1,amazon.com

2555,"On Friday, April 17, 2015 before 8:00am, I placed 2 orders and paid additional money for next day delivery. Late Friday evening I received an email from Amazon that the items would be delivered at 8pm Saturday evening. As luck would have it, the items did not arrive. I contacted Amazon's Customer Service department shortly after 8pm Saturday evening. I spoke with a first line representative, a supervisor and manager to explain that my shipments never arrived which were gifts for my niece's birthday party on Saturday. I also explained that my niece waited all day to receive her gifts and was excited about her special day. All 3 Amazon representatives told me that the delivery date and time were estimates, and that the items would arrive on Monday, April 20. Nowhere did it mention that the overnight shipping was an estimate. The reason I asked for a manager is because the supervisor also said, ""sometimes we get disappointed."" This was unacceptable! I told her that adults understand, but children do not. Children are kids for a short time and look forward to birthdays and holidays. Had I known on Friday morning when I placed the order that delivery was going to be at 8pm not earlier in the day, I would have cancelled the order. Such information was sent via email late Friday evening and should have been noted during the ordering process. A delivery time should be available when an order is placed. Additionally, when the packages did not arrive by 8pm Saturday evening, I only learned by calling Amazon customer service that the packages would be delivered on Monday. Amazon did not take the initiative to notify me of the delayed deliveries. Had I known that the guaranteed delivery date which I paid additional shipping cost for had changed, I would have gone shopping either Friday or Saturday with my niece for her gifts. The Amazon representatives were insensitive to the situation and made excuses for the company. Their generous offer was to refund the guaranteed overnight shipping cost. Meanwhile, I still have no gifts for my niece. To say the least, I am extremely disappointed with my overall Amazon experience.",1,amazon.com

2560,In 2014- based on the advertisement-and my conversation with their customer service representative- I bought from Amazon- a 10 inch foam mattress- made by Sleep Well. I was deployed for active military duty-and upon my return- I attempted to buy a frame. I was now told that any frame I bought-would require a wooden plywood-to be placed between the frame and mattress- to ensure the warranty- and not injure the sleeper. I contacted Amazon- and after they read the advertisement- we filed an A-Z Complaint. I never heard from anyone- besides my refund was denied. Meanwhile I spoke to Sleep Well-and under the circumstances they were sending me a replacement mattress. Amazon wrote me a thank you letter- and was sending it up via Corporate- because any frame sold by Amazon-made by Olee-Zanus etc- approximately 100 frames- are all falsely advertised- and all require that plywood board to be paced on the frame- this is no-where mentioned in any of their ads- so all 100 advertisements for these frames would have to be revised. Meanwhile A-Z without talking to me about anything denied my claim- even though Sleep Well was willing to replace the damaged mattress. At no charge. I asked Amazon to compensate me-for all the time-aggravation-and work that I performed- that permitted their organization to send this information up the ladder to Corporate-so that all these bed frames would have to be revised and corrected. I asked for compensation-for all my time and work- in the form of a metal frame-that holds a box spring- as to ensure the 10 year warranty of the mattress. After being put on hold for over 1 hour- so Indian Supervisor came back- and was rather rude- and objected in doing anything besides denying my claim. I have forwarded all these letters to Mr. Bezos- of course I don't expect him to respond- but possibly one of his subordinates after reading this fiasco- would make things right. In the last year- the Amazon catch phrase has become- if your not happy- return the product-and we shall provide you with a full refund. Great business practice.

2564,"There are millions of people who only have one computer in their home, or uses the same account to shop with, and when they are buying a gift for someone they don't want them to see the recommendation, because it is based on what you viewed. Anyone else who uses the computer and goes to Amazon can see what you are looking at. And you can't turn that feature off.  And like most big companies today; there is nobody you can talk to; they simply don't want to hear about any customer complaints, unless it's on a list they provide.  They are also not cheap. The other day I was going to order a basketball pump from them; it was $4.95; with $6.75 shipping. I went to E-bay found the same pump, for the same price from a 5 star dealer, and the shipping was free. The Amazon seller wanted more for shipping, and handling then the item cost.  Amazon only gives you free shipping if you spend over $35.00. In my book that makes them yet another Corporate giant trying to get more out of you, then you should have to pay.  There are better deals on E-Bay then these rip off artists are trying to scam you with. They are sneaky! My wife ordered a vest for me on their website. There was no mention that this vest was coming from China until after you place your order.  The vest cost $20.00 with shipping. What they don't mention is that if it doesn't fit, like mine didn't; it would cost you $20.00 to send it back to China. I myself would call that deceptive practices. They knew how much it would cost to return this item; but they didn't tell you! Bottom line; you can get the same stuff on E-Bay that you can get from Amazon, from some honest Mom, and Pop business, often with free shipping.

2568,"You know this is the worst buying experience I have had in my entire life and I'm 63 yrs old. I have had better experiences buy a used car then it was dealing with Amazon on this. First off I will never ever purchase another product from any of amazon's affiliates. When you sell a product you ought to have someone there that can answer questions on what the products limits are. I called amazon before I purchased this unit and the person could tell my absolutely nothing on what the product could do. Explained to the person what I was going to use the product for and they said it would do just fine. I also called the manufacturer to see what they said about it too and was told the very same thing. After I had 2 units both of them damaged and had to be repaired by me to make it look decent. Took me probably 2 hours to straighten the sleeves on the units. Without any compensation whatsoever for doing it. I could have called the service center and had them come out and fix it I guess but of course the nearest one is 4 hours away and that would have cost you guys a bunch of money but I fixed them myself. The worst thing about this whole deal is I bought the unit for a new building and there was a hole cut in my wall to fit this unit. Now when I find out the unit isn't anything close to what I need to do the job I wanted it to. I have a hole in my wall where a different product will not fit. So I have to have the contractor of the building to come out and replace a bunch of wains coating and insulation. This was not free so I not only did all the repairs on the unit taking it in and out of the building several times I had to get my building fixed. And then the returning of the product was another thing. You advertise this unit as being 150 lbs. and it was 195 lbs so UPS wouldn't ship it back to you. I got the first one all packaged up and they picked it up. The next day it was sitting on my front porch on it's top. I couldn't even get out of my door since the unit was placed in front of my door. So being 63 and having to try and move this 195 lbs package off my porch was another interesting undertaking. So had to go buy some 2x4's and build a ramp to get the package up and my truck. So there was another expense. The 2nd one was the same way, you sent a tag from UPS, they picked it up and brought it back the next day. I hope all your customers aren't treated this way or your company will go the way of your first phone a failure. If I can post this message on your website I surely will because this is totally an unacceptable way to do business in my opinion. I also very mad at all the run around I have been getting on getting the refund. Was told the first time the credit you gave me for the bent up sleeve was compensation for the work done on the unit and the full price would be credited back to me if I didn't want to exchange it but that was another fib I guess because it sure wasn't. I'm sure no one will read this unless I can post it on Amazon's website someplace or somewhere I can give you a rating on your business.  Thanks for nothing, thanks for all the run around and thanks for all my added expense to get heat in my building.  Tim",1,amazon.com

2580,"Even if you can put aside the horrible treatment of Amazon employees, even if you can overlook the fact that Amazon is killing brick and mortar (along with all those retail jobs), this company is still horrible. There customer service is a joke. Fraud runs rampant now. I'm a savvy shopper and still got scammed twice in the last few months.  First ordered a Nintendo Switch was charged and received a tracking number that never moved. It took Amazon far too long to refund the obvious scam. Second time I got a fake 200 GB SanDisk micro SD card. It looked like a legit 200 GB card, but was just blank plastic on the backside and was actually only an 8 GB card. Again Amazon was slow to refund and amazingly didn't even close down the scam sellers account. I then received an Amazon gift card as a gift from my aunt that had a zero balance on it when I tried to use it. Amazons response was basically too bad so sad. They said, ""It appears someone other than the intended recipient used the gift card. We cannot offer a refund."" Gee that's nice, and when I asked who used the card they said that info is private. They admit the card was fraudulently used, but then hide who did it and do no further investigation. No wonder scams run rampant on Amazon, their rules literally promote scammers. That was the final straw, I cancelled a huge Christmas order I had placed as well as my Prime membership. The funny thing is Amazon actually isn't always the cheapest, they've just brainwashed us all into thinking it.  I ended up becoming a Gamers Club Member at Best Buy and reordered all the Christmas stuff even cheaper than it was from Amazon and felt good supporting a brick and mortar store and the sales associates who depend on that job. Amazon is a horrible company that is getting so big they believe they don't have to care about anyone. Stop supporting this company, or in the future we will all be forced to work for Amazon and buy from Amazon, as they will have fulfilled their evil plan and put all brick and mortar stores out of business.",1,amazon.com
2581,"I live in Sweden and usually order from amazon.com. My 2 latest bookorders was not good."" The philosophers stone"" by Joseph P Farrell was not cut on the longside. Next book was also Farrell, ""The financial vipers of Venice"". The guy or girl who picked my order must have come directly from a donutstand. Half the donut was on my cover. Another thing i dont like is that Amazon have some kind of deal with manufactorers that prohibites them from shipping some items to Sweden(this goes for Amazon.uk as well).When i try to order for example a phone or camerafilters, the answer i get is that there is something wrong with my adress and that they cant process my order.Thats all they say. Most annoying is that they send emailreminders and want to me continue my ordering of the stuff they just said that i cant have. Amazing Amazone",1,amazon.com

2583,"Why don't see your Amazon many illegal business operations and human right violations??? I need this answer. You treat others illegally,and then again do this same law violations to me.  I will let every one know what you Amazon does law violations. Why don't focus on improving your sale stuff quality, but screw a customer, and beat it harshly and rudely??? Your rudeness and illegality will finally punish your own business. I don't know who is your name. If you have any humanity and morality, please leave this wrongful sale company and find a good company to get a bright future. I already check with lawyers. Your closure of my account violated the law. Your own illegal policy should be erased without delay. Your store has only 30 days return. Your store should keep its return without reserve. I always do return legally, without any way to like your Amazon does always in law violations followed by many lawsuits. Amazon has return policy, you should fulfill it. If you can't fulfill it without reserve and can't afford returns, you can close your business; and stop deceiving us customers from telling them your return policy, but don't keep it. As I restate it again. I never do anything wrong, I just do any return legally and follow the law. If your Amazon can't offer returns to customers, you can close your business immediately. I believer there are lots and lots of business operators and online stores can do this very well without rudeness and illegality like Amazon always does. If you don't want me to return your garbage and defective quality products, you can notice that I can't return them beforehand. So I will not return them, and throw these garbage away and destroy them.  But you can't close my account after I follow legal procedures to return bad quality garbages. This is illegal, rude and bestial!!!  As I said again, if you can't afford return, why you deceive me to joint Amazon prime membership??? If you don't want to fulfill your return policy, why you allow me to return garbage, and then close my account???? This is illegal!!! If you don't want me to return garbage, you can tell me; I will throw them away without return. But you should never treat any customer like this: you allow their return, but you close their accounts. They do everything legally, but you treat legal customers illegally and rudely. As I say it again, you should reopen my account. I want my account reopen is not because I want to further buy anything from Amazon, but it's for justice and rights!!! Your sale company Amazon, a buy-sell online company has this rude and immoral and illegal policy; what you should do humanly is to correct that old and illegal policy; but not allow it to hurt more and more people. I see online many customers account was closed. We will together fight for justice and rights. You should stand on the right side, and do everything legally. If you don't allow a customer return, you can stop that; and put your non-return policy on the product page; if you want to have it, you should fulfill return policy all the time without discrimination and inequality.  As a legal customer, please reopen my account. Don't do illegally and wrongfully again and again to people. If you don't want to obey the law and fulfill your promise in US, please close your online store and go somewhere like North Korea to do whatever you want to customers; but never do illegally in US. Lawyers have their ways to punish and put sale stores on the right track, and uphold customers rights. Say it again, Amazon has 30 days return policy, it must fulfill it; if a sale store Amazon can't fulfill it, you can say non-return policy in your virtual non- physical website. But you never do this to customers: allow return, but close their accounts and force them shut down. This is not any customer's fault; they return garbage stuff, because Amazon has return policy and also lots and lots of defective and bad quality stuff full of Amazon. No one want to waste their time on any return, if not without any way to keep garbage stuff. Like on Ebay, many sellers sell their stuff without return policy, people buy them also without return. But if any store has return policy, that store has to follow the rule and also the law to fulfill it. Don't treat customers like naive chicken. You have this policy, you should fulfill it; you can't fulfill it, please say you don't have return policy; let customers choose it. You should not close any legal customers' account. I don't steal any credit cards, I don't return mis-presented stuff, I never claim non-lost stuff. All of my purchases and returns are completely legal, you don't have any way to close my account. As I said it again, if you don't want return, you can say it and stop it, but can't close any customer account.  Only because of legal return, you Amazon close a customer account; it totally shows your Amazon does NOT respect and obey the law and business rules. This law violations will get punished and law sued.  Please must reopen my account, for saving Amazon from badness and law violations, and for justice and human rights. Each time, I contact Amazon, there is a real name for communication. But why always no name on this email, suspect what's wrong with your inside systems?  Please put your NAME in the email. I must know who treated me like this illegally, who did destroy Amazon reputation and ruin Amazon with such illegal closure behavior! As for $50 credit, it's not a promotion or something as you deceived, it's a compensation for a seller cheated me on Amazon for my money without any product sale. That seller cheating nearly damaged my daily life during those days.  Why not improve your sale system and prevent seller's cheating, but focuses on a legal customer's return??? All my purchases and returns information are all my private information, why you record and track all my private information??? You Amazon want to sell them for another money, like lawsuits were under way against this anti-human rights???? You should focus on product quality and seller's quality, this is the best way to get Amazon cash and competitive to other many stores; but never put any finger on any legal customers who always follow Amazon's return policy and obey the law.  You put your finger on a legal customer, please move away your illegal finger, and treat a customer legally!  If your Amazon's fault to allow return, but not customer's fault. Any return is just followed within 30 days return range. All returns are legal! If your Amazon can't afford customer return, please stop return policy and say it in your still running website.  But never do this again: you have return policy, but don't fulfill them.  It's your Amazon's fault, not mine. Please reopen my account, correct Amazon's illegal behavior.",1,amazon.com
2584,"I believe Amazon is involved in fraud. They seem to have a glitch in their online ordering system that causes you to order items that you do not want. I was ordering two books, but had others in my shopping cart, I selected a quantity of 0 on the items that I did not want. The only step to proceed from that page was to place the order, and the items that I had select as 0 quantity where ordered. Immediately afterwards I cancelled the order! And received confirmation of the cancelation, but still the order was placed. So now even if I cancel my order I still have to pay shipping. A company as big as this would not make their website so user friendly with out it being an intentional way to make customers spend more $$ then the intend to. Seems like fraud to me.",1,amazon.com
2585,"Dont buy from Amazon seller Stores123. I bought this as a Christmas present for my fiance who likes modern furniture. I received the item and upon unpacking it, it seemed as though it had already been unpacked. The box was tattered and the packing tape had been retaped. Once I opened the product, I inspected it and found the underside fabric was torn where there was a piece of the wood frame supporting the center. It was not a large tear but it was a tear never-the-less. I decided that it was likely a used product sent by mistake so I repacked it immediately. Given that Christmas was a few days away, I went to a local furniture shop and found something similar to buy in time for Christmas. I bought the product because it was on Amazon so I felt comfortable. I do understand Amazon uses 3rd party sellers and the return policy for this seller seemed straight-forward: if the product is damaged, they buyer can return it for a full refund. The seller has been trying to get the 15% restocking fee from the beginning of my communication with them. I dont think I should have to pay $100+ to them because they sent me a used product by mistake. They are claiming that there is no tear on the bottom fabric but that is absolutely not true and I am surprised they would blatantly lie like that. They have even sent me photos they took upon return of the product and the tear is shown (again, it is not big, but it is there and it is something I would consider as damage and would buy off a classified bulletin board). At this point, I have requested them to refund me 100% of what I paid and I have disputed the charge through my credit card issuing bank. Stores123 have not replied to me with any message indicating they will provide me a 100% refund. They have offered to send me the product back (which I clearly do not want) or to pay a 15% restocking fee. I really feel extorted here as they are in clear violation of their return policy.",1,amazon.com
2586,"I had purchased from them for the last 12 years and had no problem. However, I recently bought an electronic item and needed it returned. Amazon sided with the seller. The seller agreed to the return, e-mailed me that it received the item back and refused to refund money. Amazon knew this, had Post Office Delivery proof, and only sent protected e-mails to the seller. When this didn't work, Amazon refused to help me.  On my own I had to find out Sellers address and phone number and contact them. They claimed I wasn't in their system at all and never heard of the company that shipped it. I told them the 3 names the Corporation was registered as being under, the two addresses, and the Presidents' name. I told them I would be contacting the State Attorney's Office for fraud, US mail order fraud, and credit card fraud, etc. They hung up on me. The next day Amazon credited my charge. I will never use Amazon again. They still allow this company to sell on their site knowing they are frauds.",1,amazon.com

2588,"Horrid customer service! I recently bought an iPod touch from Amazon (the actually site, not a reseller listed on the site) and recently got a phone call from them saying I now owe a collection agency $275 for the iPod (note, this call was from Amazon, NOT the agency). After the first call this morning (November 3rd) I called Amazon back to ensure this wasn't a spoof of some sort (seeing as the number was 5 digits). After talking to Amazon the first time, I was told that the reason I owe money was that I did not have the funds needs to pay for the iPod when they tried to charge me yesterday (November 2nd). I was also told that they had contacted my bank-which, after a talk with my bank, they didn't do-to ensure I had the funds needed at the time of ordering (October 20). After the explantion of Amazon's poor charging times, I was told to contact the collection agency to talk to them. So I did. I couldn't get in touch with them [the collection agency] so I called my bank for suggestions on my next step. I was told to call Amazon back, which I did. After having to explain to them [Amazon] what I was told earlier, I was contacted to a three way call with myself, the Amazon rep, and a rep from the collection agency. The agency was rather gruff with me, but I was rather pissed, and was trying to get a simple answer out of the Amazon rep who was still on the line: why did you send me an iPod without being paid(To me, this seems like a horrible business trait)? Instead of an answer to that, I was told that my account number (since I ""paid"" for the iPod directly from my bank account) must have been typed wrong. To which I asked why Amazon didn't tell me at the moment of this realization on their part. All said and done, I will NEVER use Amazon again. I realize I am only one person not using a multi-national company, but due to this terrible way of dealing with not only their customers, but their money.",1,amazon.com

They tell you to do an appeal but they want accept any information such as receipts or ID's.

2596,"It's easy to get lured in by the cheap prices for new hard cover books. But I feel they have gone too far. I mean, you can buy anything from baby wipes to a tire iron. Why does it need to be so big? And when I had a problem with a merchant who overcharged me (some sort of clerical error on THEIR part) over 8 times what I was quoted to pay it took me nearly 3 months to clear it up. There is no phone number to call and talk to a live human being and I had to send email after email to try to clear it up. It was ridiculous.  But let's focus on their book review section for a moment: I really hated a book and gave it one star. The author harassed me using various aliases and, then worst of all, got Amazon.com to pull me one star review AND I was accused of hectoring this author. All because this one little crybaby (named Paul Cohn...look it up...I kid you not) complained. And what I found especially fascinating about this particular author is that besides writing total crap ""novels"" he attacked everyone who gave his book anything less than 5 stars and ALL of his 5 star reviews were from ""people"" who had never written another book review in their LIFE! I mean... it wasn't a best seller... it maybe sold 20 or 30 copies and it has about 10 5 star reviews that these reviewers have NEVER written another single book review.  I mean, if that doesn't reek or sound of fish, I don't know what does. And Amazon comes down on me??? well, that's just crazy. I say skip Amazon.com and buy local (even though I do live in Seattle, so Amazon is local for me)...because there are so many other book stores who deserve your business.  And don't even get me started on their secondary market. I recently purchased a book that was said to be in ""like new"" condition. When I got it the cover was torn, there was a red wine (I hope it was red wine) stain on it and worse of all!!! Some passages in the book were underlined in pen! So I complained 3 weeks ago and they said they would refund my money...but have they? ope. And I'll bet you anything it will take between 10-15 emails to get them to honor their money back guarantee. That was 3 weeks ago, and I have not received an email saying that my money was refunded. I would say this is the ONLY time I would ever say: Set fire to Amazon!

I had always sold strictly on Ebay.com for 4 years now and have always been happy with my experience there. So last week I decided I would try selling on Amazon. I set up my seller account, listed 5 items for sale and figured that would be it. I'd check it every day to see if any of my items sold. The next day I checked it and to my surprise, Amazon stated that they had suspended my account because of policy violations. Upon further inspection I found out that they had suspended my account because they had linked my account to another suspended seller account. I thought this must be a mistake as I don't have nor have I ever had another amazon account. Nor does anyone living in my household, ie my girlfriend. After emailing amazon and explaining this I received a form generated email back from them stating that while they could not share any info on how they relate accounts or what account I am supposedly related to they had significant proof that I was linked to another account. After many emails I finally called there customer service and was told in exact words, there was nothing they could do to help me. I asked if there was a superior I could talk to or anyone who could help me and was told no, that department does not respond by phone. At this point I was getting very frustrated, and after a few more emails back and forth, with every single amazon response being another form generated email, I finally contacted the better business bureau. Well, alot of good that did. Amazon gave them the same bulls&*t response they gave me. So I asked, if someone is using my name, bank account etc, shouldn't they tell me what this so called account is I am linked to so I can put a stop to. Well, Amazon does not give any info on how they link accounts, I'm just supposed to take there word for it that I am linked to another account. Finally I contacted amazon to close any and all accounts related to my name and after probably 10 emails and 4 or 5 more phone calls, all just to get my damn account closed, because I WILL NEVER, EVER , EVER shop their crap website again, I finally managed to get my account closed for good. I don't know who the hell amazon thinks they are but this is one website I will never be visiting again. I have sold on Ebay for 4 years now and have a 99.7 percent rating on there, and have never encountered anything like this at all. If I have to call Ebay, I am always able to talk to a live person who usually can solve my problem in a matter of minutes. Amazon has poor customer service at best. AT BEST! I am not the only one with complaints like these either, google AMAZON SUCKS and look at all the pages.

Amazon has a tendency to deliver packages days after it was scheduled for delivery .Sometimes they don't even ship your package until the day that it was supposed to be delivered to you. If it's an important item that you drastically need in a hurry I suggest shopping somewhere else. They are sometimes very unreliable, their customer service can use some improvement, and their delivery times are usually unpredictable to say the least.  I ordered lights to decorate my dorm room off of amazon and I never received my order from them. When I first ordered it they told me that it would come within 4 to 5 business days: however, that was not the case. My lights did not ship until the 4th day of me waiting for them. I waited a couple days to see if my package would come. After about three days of not receiving my ""shipped"" package I decided that it was time to take matters into my own hands. I first called the delivery company that was supposed to drop off my package and they said that they never got a package for my address or name. I then decided to email amazon and they replied back saying that my item was shipped to the postal service that would be delivering it. Although, they said that my items were shipped I still did not receive them days later so I decided to call the company to and find out why. The first time I gave them a call I was on hold for at least 30 minutes waiting to talk to a representative. After being on hold for a significant amount of time, I was told that there were no available representatives to talk to at that time and that I should call the next day. The next day when I called I was on hold for a while but I finally got to talk to someone about my order. I was told that my order had been sent back because of an unknown error. I never got an email or notification saying that the order that I have been waiting on for weeks was sent back. When I asked why my order got sent back the representative told me that she was not sure why but sometimes it just happens. When I asked for my money she told me that I had to email amazon or go to the website and click on ""about refunds"" and ask back for my money there. So I emailed amazon and asked them for a refund due to the fact that my package got canceled but I never got my money back. The next day they emailed me and said they would refund me my money back within 24 hours of my initial email. I waited for the money but it never went back into my account so I emailed them again and this time they didn't respond until days later saying that, once again, they would send my money back to me. After not receiving my money a second time I just decided not to worry about it and just decided to be cautious of where and what I buy online.

2616,I just started using amazon a few months ago. Was impressed at first. But over a short period of time that changed. Customer support is in india from what i can understand. All they say is yes yes yes and they have no frickin idea of the complaint. Ask for a superviaor and guess what. Yes your correct another indian this one claims to have a american name but the same result you have to ask them to repeat thereselves over and over. They say they will take care of issue and you will get a email saying its being handled.. No email has been received. Luckily i had the trial membership because its now cancelled. Now amazon will be nothing but a price check site since all the neg reveiws are deleted or reworded.. They claim i wrote a product reveiw that i did not write and it was deleted do to bias. 3 ppl and 55 mins later nothing understandable. Finally told woman my house hold will no longer be a amazon client. Her reply was thats all you can do sir.. So all i can do is shop else where. Bet your a** thats what i will do..after tax and crazy shipping prices its the same cost or cheaper to buy do the road.... Example i was going to oreder a product that was 1.50 sh was 8.99. I thought might as well order a fair amount for the shipping.clicked 5. They weight 5 grams a peice... Sh charges look out 44.95. For less then 10 dollars and 25 grams. Yes grams ec1118 yeast.. Are you kidding me a bd card weighs more and i sent it across country for lesa the 50 cents.. Also found something on amazon for 550.00 and the sellers web site had it for 410.00. Amazon can now kiss my southern ***. Keep you chinese crap and your half witted ppl from india.,2,amazon.com
2617,"Amazon used to be this amazing company from a customer standpoint, but now that it has shut down most of its competition and continues to grow, the company is starting to tank. Prime is no longer Prime as you're paying more for it and receiving less. Two day shipping is a lie, it's more like 4 or 5 day or whenever they feel like it shipping. Returns are more difficult to make and their product pricing is steadily increasing. The media and entertainment portion is a joke. This includes both the tv and music portion. I have increasingly found better products and prices fro other companies and I am seriously considering cancelling my Prime membership. After all, what's the point if you're paying for shipping by paying a higher price and receiving it days later than the ""guaranteed"" delivery date?",2,amazon.com
2618,"Amazon used to be good but in recent years they become more and more shady. They treat sellers like less than dirt and allow unethical practices and DMCA violations.

I try me best never to order anything from this disgraceful eCommerce site anymore.",2,amazon.com
2619,"Amazon is great so don't get me wrong. But their choice of delivery drivers is beyond outrageous. I have security cameras and they have detected one throwing a package on my porch; another leaving it in the evening on the stairs in plain view and today one that stopped to read my request to leave items inside the large box I have on my porch for that purpose, only to then walk past the box and the porch to leave the expensive DNA test kit under the sun in front of my garage door. Mind you, NONE of the drivers bother to knock on the door or ring the doorbell and most do not read my instructions clearly posted next to my front door. No problems with USPS, Fedex or UPS but Amazon's delivery system is bizarre. I returned the DNA kit for the probable damage caused by 3 hours in the sun. I will not order from them again.",2,amazon.com

It turns out that Amazon is trying to get people to buy through their Kindle e-books by pricing hard copy too high for the value (clever marking but customer negative and expensive). Nasty policy. Returns have become more difficult, much more. Some manager ahs decided that a way to raise profits for unfortunate buyers is too exclude the Buyer and limit returns. If you have, by some magic ghost like decision Maker as Amazon have returned too many item, in their minds, then you are notified that you cannot buy anymore. Many people have protested, many reinstated. The real issue is that Amazon allows any hack two-bit outfit to sell on Amazon. So people receive bad products, out-of-spec products, damaged products, etc. more often then in the past. Returns have escalated due to Amazons anyone can sell policy. It is definitely not the Purchaser but the Seller who need to be excluded. Amazon claims to review Sellers for performance which is very limited. When greed dominates it is a real 'fire'. The policy that has been established is profit above service, quality, product performance, product as suppose to be.",2,amazon.com

During these past 6 months however I've observed some changes in the customer experience of this ""customer centric company""; several of my orders now arrive minus total quantities, fragile items are not packed well at all or arrive completely damaged, and some missing orders only arrive after a follow up email is sent to Amazon.com Founder, Chairman, and CEO Mr. Jeff Bezos. In one recent month, 10 of my orders have arrived in an abysmal state; upon a review of each parcel it was not the fault of the shipping company.  In the interim, Amazon Prime Movies that were once available for no fee to paying Amazon Prime members are now available for additional fees.

One: using free shipping with minimum purchase amount, they always sit on the order from 5 to 7 business days.These are in stock items and status reads preparing for shipment.I have seen credible reports detailing how efficient they and how they slave drive their order pickers. Sellers on ebay virtually always ship out next day. So why a week stalling my orders, EVERY time? I can only conclude its to force customers using free shipping to join amazon prime. So I did. Or at least wanted to. I check the box for free 30 day membership and placed an order using my debit card. A couple of hours later I get an email and it says my order cant be shipped because my debit card turned down the $100 prime membership fee. Huh? The terms and conditions of prime free trial clearly state that amazon charges you the $100 at the END of the 30 day trial. And thats if you want the year of prime. Guess they lied. I ordered the same item from ebay. No problems. I guess they figure most people will take prime anyway after the trial and not notice they were billed a month earlier or figure fighting them for a refund if they dont is futile. Dishonest company.",2,amazon.com

2634,"I feel compelled to update my review in light of Amazon's rotten service as of the past six months or so. Most of my supposed 2-day delivery orders never make it in two days, if I receive them at all (which then necessitates phone calls on my end to Amazon). The delivery companies have even posted pictures of other people's houses and claim that our house is where they delivered our packages. I've also received wrong merchandise that Amazon wanted ME to pay for to return! The delivery services they use are THE WORST!! Most of the time, our packages are either shoved into our mailbox or set beside it AT THE CURB, some of them getting soaked by the rain (I'm sorry that we live on a private drive, but for $99 per year for Prime, I expect better service). But the worst situation was recently when, on Amazon's own website in the My Orders section, it was stated that a Prime Pantry order of mine (my first order with PP, by the way) had been delivered 8 DAYS BEFORE WE ACTUALLY RECEIVED IT!! Not to mention that it had been placed, again, next to our mailbox, IN THE POURING RAIN! A neighbor called and told us that she saw it. The products inside that were in cardboard boxes were damp, but luckily nothing was ruined. The first person with whom I spoke at Amazon had to transfer me to another department (after dealing with ANOTHER order of mine that had been claimed on Amazon was delivered, as well, but was not). The second woman was VERY nice and said that Amazon is aware of all of the delivery problems and is working on it. I did end-up getting the choice of a refund or another box of them same items delivered for free, as well as have my $7.99 shipping cost returned (yeah, that even made it worse - the fact that I had PAID almost $8 to have THIS kind of service >:-( ). It's interesting how the free box of items showed-up the next day on my doorstep :-/ . Anymore, I try to find what I need on ANY other website and only go to Amazon for what I can't get anywhere else. I really don't know how much longer we'll keep our Prime subscription. Some other company needs to throw their hat in the ring and knock Amazon off its pedestal!",2,amazon.com
2635,"I really used to like Amazon, but a few recent experiences are making me reconsider my Prime membership, or doing much business with them at all. First, I had ordered some items for Christmas~ I ordered on December 18th, and they were due on the 20th. Then I get an e-mail saying the package would be delayed, and they were due on the 22nd. Christmas Eve morning, I contact them by chat and tell them I am hosting a holiday party in a few hours and still don't have the package. They again tell me that it is ""delayed"", that it is ""lost in transit"" but they assure that I will get the package by the end of the day (I did not), and they will refund the amount. I ask if I will still get the items if I am refunded, and that representative says that I will. Christmas morning, I contact them again and they say the package was lost, and that I need to reorder the items, but that negates the refund I was credited. I ask what they are going to do about the fact that my original package was never received, and the Christmas items we were waiting for will be arriving well after Christmas. They tell me that they will give me a credit of $5 to use towards my next order (then they say they will make it a $15 credit). However, we just recently placed an order, and I'm pretty sure they did not apply any credit to it. The second issue is that they charged our daughter's student card (which she had registered under our account so she could get things she needs for school) for our Hulu subscription. I asked why her card was suddenly charged when it has always been charged to the same card. They tried to say that there was not sufficient funds on our card, so that is when they charged hers. I checked our account and there were enough funds in our account when they charged her card. I told them that they should have given us notice if there were insufficient funds instead of going ahead and using her card, and that they should refund the amount to her, which they said they were going to do. But today they send an e-mail saying they are not able to refund the amount to her card! I told them that is not acceptable, so we shall see what happens after this.  I definitely notice a decline in their customer service from previous years. It used to be if there were any issues (which were rare), they were resolved quickly and with limited contact. Now I've had two negative experiences in less than a month of each other, I got bounced around between at least 5 different representatives last time, and the representatives try to placate you while telling you they cannot really help you (and it is not easy to understand what they are saying, the messages are in broken English). I have seen several people on other review sites saying that they have been told that 2- Day Shipping no longer applies (even though that is what they advertise and you pay for)....if that is the case, what is the point of having a Prime membership?",2,amazon.com
2636,"I shop for some things at Amazon. (Very Few). Their prices on a lot of items is ridiculous.

But by the time it arrived I had already been refunded after my complaint. The third time I attempted to order from them was last week: When I entered my order for an item costing $20 their system told me if I ordered at least $35 of stuff I would get free shipping. So I changed my order to double the amount of the identical product from the same supplier. When I did that they then said I had to order over $50 to get free shipping, and when I increased my order, again, this time to $53, at the check out they added $20 more to cover shipping. I cancelled the order, and when I complained they tried to shift the blame to the shipper of the goods, when it had been THEIR ordering process that had been making the promises of free shipping. In two words: silly deceit. I doubt I will waste any more time trying to order stuff from Amazon in the future.",2,amazon.com

2645,"I don't even know where to start with this review. I think anyone who's paying attention would see there are cheaper and easier places to shop, but clearly people simply shop for convenience these days. Not to mention they're building a complete Monopoly and yet paying zero federal taxes. In my opinion Amazon is everything that's wrong with our culture. We don't typically shop there anyway but were recently gifted an item from a prime member. This experience has been a catastrophe from start to finish: - First, the price jumped $9 from the time I found the item to the time they were ordered, which was about 24 hours. - item arrived and sizing was completely off. - This was a gift, yet I was told exchanges are not allowed unless the item is defective and you're exchanging for the EXACT same size, color, etc. So they would send a return label then send a gift card once the item was received. - item shipped back quickly and the card was sent to my email...for the cheaper price of the item, NOT the price that was paid for it. - I emailed customer service, who said ""well, send us the original order number and we'll look into it."" (Obviously I'd provided the original number when I requested the return. But, fine, I'll play their games. At this point I've already decided I won't be doing business with them ever again. I'm just trying to get through it to get my son his birthday gift!!) - I did a customer service chat, and was told sure they'd send the remaining balance, although they had actually charged us (the gift recipient) for return shipping and subtracted it from the value of the gift!! Unbelievable. - We just realized they sent the shipping fee to the original sender, so my son is still short $9 on the value of his gift. The prime member who sent the gift suggested we just send her the gift card number and she'll reorder the correct size. This is far too many hoops to jump through to send or receive a simple gift. We will not be doing business with them again.",2,amazon.com
2646,"Amazon used to be great, and was my go to site for ordering anything online. However in the last few times I ordered from them, my packages were delivered by ""flex drivers."" I live in a building with locked doors to the lobby that require a key to get in. In the past the mail people would just put my package in the mailbox or leave it by the door for me. But these flex drivers don't have keys and would ring my bell over and over and over and over. When I got downstairs some Joe Schmo off the street is holding my package, rudely shoving it at me and running away. The first time it happened I thought my package was sent to a neighbor across the street by mistake and he was pissed about it. He acted like I really inconvenienced him and pissed him off. But after 3 more incidents I did some research and realized that these random people are handling my packages, and every single one of them has been completely RUDE. Maybe it's just the area I live in, but not one of them has been polite and I don't appreciate being disturbed. I don't want strangers off the street handling my stuff and ringing my doorbell over and over again. I live on the 3rd floor, have a small child and work from home. It's not convenient or an enjoyable experience to order from Amazon anymore, which is a shame. I used to love Amazon prime but I will never resubscribe to it until they get rid of these flex drivers and only let professionals handle packages. And I haven't missed them at all. I can get the same stuff from ebay, often cheaper with free shipping without the hassle or subscription fee. Prime TV isn't worth it either. There's only a few shows and movies you can watch and they charge you for the good stuff. You have access to about 10 crappy kindle books that no one wants to read. Not worth the $99 bucks IMO.",2,amazon.com

The actual packing has become very bad, a recent delivery of books have been thrown in with tools or other items without any protection, resulting in a book that looks decidedly second hand before they have even been used. I never used to have to return items but this year about 15% of all my orders have arrived damaged. Prices used to be the best but with a little Google search I'm find better deals on other sites and now that Amazon has decided to start charging tax on all sales, other sites are looking so much more appealing.

If I need something desperately I will order through my Prime account and pay full over priced for it but I have backed off ordering through Amazon because there are just too many wonderful online sites that offer the exact same products at betters prices and with free shipping if you search the Internet for free shipping coupons, or even just ask the retailer for a coupon telling them you will go to Amazon. There are also too many counterfeiters on Amazon and Amazon knows it and does nothing about it. eBay recently got outed and eBay will become a thing of the past. People are realizing that eBay is siding with crooked sellers and counterfeirs and selling out the customers. Amazon needs to clean up it's act and watch it's price points.

Customer service stated they did not need to ship it by a certain day and they only needed to be within the estimated time frame for delivery. Very slow shipping took 9 days to ship from 90 miles away. Amazon waited to the last day to ship and it was in stock. I guess you have to pay a $100 to get good service with prime account.

So I cancelled our order. and over the next 50+ hrs reviewed the posting and noticed. . . .  ! Within 20 hrs  Amazon dropped mention on the product posting that the product was sold and fulfilled by them, leaving pricier seller options . . . . ! last time I chkd it had come back stating, ' shpg within 1-2 months'   Up from 3-6 wks !   ! But is still listed under their promo' units, 'amazon choice.... available to ship immediately'  catalog for this product line-up.   { ehhh !? } So they did not follow-up on all the FYIs I submitted to them within my 'pleasant' email conversations with their heavily scripted CS unit.  But kudos they did do sooome updating  ;) Glad I cancelled, for a couple reasons, _who knows when delivery would actually happen _and the unknowns were now conflicting with a road trip. Will I attempt to do business thru Amazon (?) probably not, unless the product of interest is 'In Stock', and waaay cheaper than regional vendors ! Thanks SiteJabber for this platform to share . . . .",2,amazon.com
2664,"My recent orders got delayed, even though I pay extra to be a prime member. Amazon does not pay attention to deliveries. Im very dissapointed by them. My recent order supposed to be within a month, and after a month they sent me the option do delay it to one more month. Their only help option is to cancel the order. Im not satisfied as a prime member",2,amazon.com
2665,"Got on Amazon to buy headlamps for my car. Gave me a ""Free Gift"", all I had to do was pay shipping. In the end I went round with a company I never heard of over testosterone pills. Cost me $32 for what I needed and $182 for what I didn't need. Thanks Amazon! You'll never get me again!!!",2,amazon.com
2666,"I have been a loyal Amazon customer for years but lately it seems to take them a week or more to even get items to the shipper. I am not a Prime customer and I believe that those are the ones they seem to care about the most. Anyway on my last order I also ordered the exact same thing from a competitor and who ever got the order to the shipper first, which was the competitor, I stayed with and canceled the Amazon order. I no longer waste my time with Amazon.",2,amazon.com
2667,"I used to be a very frequent Amazon shopper up until a couple of years ago. Then I discovered I can get the same things much cheaper elsewhere. Since then I have been shopping online at Sears, Kmart and Ebay. At Ebay some things take time to arrive (from overseas) but shipping is usually free and you don't have to go through the ""prime"" gimmicks or buy lots of stuff you don't need to get free shipping. Sears/Kmart have great coupons and deals once you have set up an account. There are many other sites as well. Amazon is over-hipped has been.",2,amazon.com
2668,"I placed an order with Amazon, but then cancelled the order to change the shipping method to faster shipping. When I tried to pay for the items my account was block. I received an email stating that I need to fax my credit card statement, which I did (fax was expensive from my country to the US, almost $6). I waited 48 and decided to phone Amazon Customer Support and within 24 hours I received a response that the fax was illegible. Lesson learned, do not cancel an order!",2,amazon.com
2669,I had bought a part for my dad's truck and when I was asked for a refund because we didn't need it any more and I asked for a refund and explained why but because I didn't respond right away because I had a funeral to attend now I have a part that I can not use or need. I am also out of over $100 so people watch what you buy on here because if you need to send it back you are sol.,2,amazon.com
2670,They store cookies in your computer to track your web habits and then email you with offers even if you didn't search for the item on amazon. they also sell the info they gather on you.,2,amazon.com
2671,too  expensive. products and cost of delivery is too expensive better off going to the company who makes the product,2,amazon.com
2672,There have been numerous times where my shipment is supposed to arrive within one day or 2 day and it does not arrive. It just happens too frequently which makes PRIME shipping services for $99/year false.,2,amazon.com
2673,"Honestly some things are still cheaper for me at amazon, but after shipping and the ""add-on"" items that you can only buy when you have a certain amount of product sold and shipped by amazon in my cart. Thats crazy because a lot of what they sell comes from other companies and sellers. Also I hate that a lot of what they sell is only for Amazon prime members. I will keep using eBay instead of dealing with all of this. Also I went to review the perfect sculpt bra.com and those views were honest and to help others not make same mistake I did, but amazon wouldn't post it, they said it didnt meet their guidelines.thought that was crap.",2,amazon.com
2674,Called customer service about an item I hadn't gotten yet and a wrong item. The wrong item was a cheaper version of my original item. They told me the only thing I could do was return it on exchange for the right item. Then the other item I had never received was told they would give me a credit but to make sure I did my research and looked at all the 3rd party companies reviews before ordering from one. Not to be ugly but that's amazon job to be checking on their 3rd party companies not mine. I am ordering through Amazon! Worst customer service ever! Will be canceling my Amazon prime.,2,amazon.com
2675,Lot of cheap chinese junk with fake great reviews and quality products are hard to find. Don't trust the reviews anymore,2,amazon.com
2676,WE recently bought Fiji water that came in a moldy box. we have also bought food items that were sold and shipped after the sell by date. Watch them! if you go to the supermarket you can check the sell by dates before buying!,2,amazon.com
2677,Amazon started off great then they blew it. Slow shipping. Some times it's a week before they even ship the products to you. Amazon should fire whomever handles that end of their business.,2,amazon.com
2678,"Amazon used to be my preferred online place to make purchases. I used to make 3 to 5 minimum or larger purchases every month. Now I'm running into a lot of no shipping to AK or HI, or only if one has a Prime account. I have no interest in the ""extras"" that come with purchasing a Prime account. Then, what good is 2 day shipping is it doesn't get shipped in less than 1 to 2 weeks? They say it is in stock, and will continue to say it is in stock up until they actually ship it. But, it still takes 1 to 2 weeks for it to leave the warehouse.  I used to prefer Amazon much more than eBay. I just placed my order on eBay after spending about an hour trying to find it available and shipable with no success on Amazon.",2,amazon.com
2679,"Amazon advertised bike shorts for $33 - a great deal. I went to their site, selected my size and BOOM - the price went to $69. They only offered the $33 on small pants, same manufacturer same product. Apparently, Amazon thinks you are stupid enough to believe there is a 100% price difference between small and large. Nope. I avoid buying from Amazon because they ship products you did not order and they let my kids run up charges on Kindles we had to dispute and they have crappy deceptive pricing.",2,amazon.com
2680,"I order stuff online all the time, Amazon for some reason seems to have issues getting me my stuff, no one else does, I order off of ebay, different clothing stores, tiger direct all kinds of places but for some reason when I order from amazon they let me buy stuff that they run out of stock on, like recently I ordered some cables from amazon themselves not an individual seller and they said it would be here on 5/15 I ordered it on 5/10 I did not pay for expedited shipping cause I was ok with it taking a week or so to get but here we are at 5/24 and it still isnt here not to mention the other items I ordered as well. I have had this happen a few time with them. disappointing.",2,amazon.com

2683,"Amazon has decent prices for Prime members and if you can't locate something specific in your town, Amazon is easy. Unfortunately, too many fakes have taken over. I ended up with a knockoff Kylie lip gloss that caused a rash, knockoff vitamins and a supplement I bought there gave me an allergic reaction. Turned out it was sawdust mixed with something called ""white cut."" (I know a lab tech in FL, sent her a pill to test for me.) There are more Chinese knockoffs on there than not for everything including top name brand stuff. I ended up with a shampoo ""sold by"" a regular shelf brand here but ended up with a really weird knockoff -packaging and all. Amazon has started putting all products of the same labeling into one big bin. If you buy Olay face cream, you may end up with one by Olay or one of the infamous knockoffs -regardless of who you bought it from and what you paid. It's called ""big boxing."" Shop with caution.",2,amazon.com
2684,"I ordered most of my Christmas gifts from Amazon. I did not receive a few gifts. No refunds , cause the sellers are no longer available on the Amazon site. There's nothing I can do, but be out my money. I don't want to even bother with them anymore",2,amazon.com
2685,"Amazon is recently starting to prevent people from leaving negative reviews on some of the products on their website citing a breach of their reviewing process even when the sentiments echo the same points as other reviews and the review itself meets the requirements and guidelines. If the seller is one of their leading partners, negative reviews have a tendency to get rejected.",2,amazon.com
2686,Have shopped at AMAZON.com for a while but of late the web site is pushing PRIME which is not at all appreciated?! If and when I elect PRIME it will be on my own not just to receive merchandise at a lesser price point?! Web site has many issues to deal with to include logging out of your account?!,2,amazon.com
2687,I have been doing buissness with Amazon for 2 years they have satisfied me and when thing don't show up after a while they send another one that only happened twice ty Amazon,2,amazon.com
2688,I had placed an order on Amazon through JFinc on March 3 of this year 2017 and never got the book. I tried to leave a review regarding JFinc as being a fraudulent seller as indicated on scam sellers . Amazon wouldn't allow the review claiming it was a violation of terms and conditions. I would have thought amazon would have wanted their customers to be aware of thieves. But apparently not. How are we to protect ourselves against scammers if amazon won't let us get a heads up by reading reviews on these scam artists on their site?,2,amazon.com
2689,"The Prime products are OK, but the products from the third party sellers are horrible. Purchase carefully from them.",2,amazon.com
2690,"Have been a satisfied ""Prime"" member for years but in the last year There has been a marked increase in failed deliveries at times on items I had been counting on getting when promised. There is a delivery notice but no package to be found. A refund was always issued but the hassle it caused was not worth the dollar or two save over [in most cases] being able to buy the same product at a local [brick & mortar] store. Amazon's delivery used to be golden but whatever they have changed will cost them sales a is a big black mark on their reputation. Don't understand why so many companies move away from a proven formula and end up causing long term damage usually due to short term greed. Will think twice now before ordering from Amazon. Bad move Amazon! A year ago I would have rated 5+ stars.",2,amazon.com
2691,"Canceled Prime. We signed up for Prime having decided on consolidating our on line purchases with them, and we'd used the service from time to time. Prime DID NOT satisfy with promise of speedy 2 day shipping on all purchases as promised, which put us through a bunch of hassles including dealing with their customer service. Frustrating at best and without resolve. In 1 instance the item purchased was available during order, and we then received a back order notice. After the hit or mis on promised delivery and poor results from contacts, we decided they don't deserve our business.",2,amazon.com
2692,"I give Amazon A LOT of my money, lately, they seem to be lacking in their customer service. I've received wrong items, clothing that comes damaged and much longer shipping times than what was estimated. You contact customer service about it and you get a generic reply.",2,amazon.com

2695,"on AMAZON I ORDERED A VOLCOM HOODIE. when I received it a month later is was a fake, and a very bad fake. the company outside of amazons site that sent it to me can't be contacted there is nothing in the bag outside the bag. so I contacted AMAZON they are no help. STICK WITH EBAY, OR SITES YOU KNOW THAT ARE NOT MAD IN HUTS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY.",2,amazon.com
2696,I don't know why they call it Prime anymore. They don't deliver in 2 days like they used to. So I don't know why I spend my hundred dollars a year for this sorry delivery service they have. I have ordered several items but never get here on time I have ordered one item that I never got. So I will not be renewing my Prime Membership it's not worth the money that's the whole point of the Prime membership is when I order it if I want it in 2 days I should get it in 2 days not 3 days or not when they decide to deliver it. All this happened in the past two years I've been a Prime member for over 5 years everything changed up when they started going to the US Postal Service I even had stuff come in from the US Postal Service as I get is the package somebody to Doug to contents out. Like I said no need to renew my Prime Membership if this is how they going to treat a Prime member. All they want to do is add you another month on when you call with a complaint. They just ain't cutting the mustard no more tired of everything coming in late or not coming in at all or coming in and no contents into package.,2,amazon.com
2697,"My last review of Amazon was favorable. However, Amazon's Customer Service, which was once the best in the industry, is now among the worst in the industry. Representatives are most often in foreign countries, extremely difficult to understand, and argumentative. Amazon's procedure of telephoning you in response to your Email request is no more. Contacting Amazon Customer Service is a maze of screens that provide neither Email or telephone number direction. (Amazon Customer Service can be reached toll free at: 1-866-216-1072, but do not anticipate cooperation or assistance.)  Allowing that one of their primary competitors now offers two day free shipping on many orders, in addition to free to store shipping, Amazon's dramatic reduction in customer service is not well timed. Amazon needs to use their drones to examine their customer service.",2,amazon.com
2698,"For more than ten years I did 99% of my shopping on Amazon, with $180-130 a month for Subscribe n Save. I am a disabled senior and the door to door shipping is very important to me. Last year I spent $6400 in all. In December Amazon decided to save shipping money by dumping all boxes (even 40 pound,3 ft long boxes) at the post office for buyers to drive and pick up. I called and emailed twice, begging for home delivery, to no avail. Ended my buying and found everything on other sites, no shipping, no membership fees,delivered to my door.",2,amazon.com
2699,"Lots of reasons to pick up the Prime service, but even nominal research into product pricing demonstrates that ""free shipping"" is an embedded cost for merchants that use Prime",2,amazon.com
2700,"I purchase 2 sets of  A100 900 High Lumens Ultra Bright - CREE XML T6 LED Tactical Flashlight one of which did not work. I contacted both Amazon and followed their protocol. I contacted the company Monsety but never received a refund or replacement. Think twice before buying from this company. Was surprised about Amazon since they are usually reliable. Have stopped shopping on line. I'd rather be able to deal with a problem in person . Tired of companies hiding behind the ""internet"" to get My money refunded.",2,amazon.com
2701,I wasn't impressed. I tried it around Christmas time and was really upset when my daughters art tablet came missing the on/off switch...kind of an important piece!!,2,amazon.com
2702,"Their main page needs a lot of work because it is a disaster. Too hard to navigate, clutter everywhere. They also make it difficult to see their shipping prices when you want to purchase an item.",2,amazon.com
2703,I just spent about 10 minutes trying to get an estimate for an order without an account. Then I tried to get Help. I spent another 7 minutes trying to get help an was unsuccessful. I could not get an email or phone number to call since I was not a registered customer. So if you are a business and don't have an Amazon account don't bother going to Amazon for an estimate of the total cost.,2,amazon.com
2704,'ve been an Amazon customer for over 20 years I have never used Prime because Amazon processed orders promptly without it. In the last 6 to 8 months I've noticed a big push by Amazon to join Prime; I've also noticed a long delay in shipping. What used to take no longer than 4 days to receive now takes 10 days BEFORE they even ship and an additional 4 days to receive. Amazon is not the only online marketer online and not always the best deal.,2,amazon.com
2705,"I return something and found out later that it was not from Amazon so it was discounted another five dollars and if you return anything you do not get any of your taxes that you paid. Anytime I shop anywhere I always get my taxes back and when I return something I get the full price. So do you watch what you're buying on Amazon because it may not be able to be returned for one and/or it may be discounted. So you may lose in the end, Just make sure that it's what you want and you don't have to return it. This is one of the worst sites ever to return something I have canceled my credit card I will shop somewhere else. This is the first time I ever returned anything to Amazon and I have been with them for three years. This is how they treat a good customer.",2,amazon.com

2707,"I did not give it 5 stars because I wish Amazon would address some shipping and package tracking issues and include more products in their special Prime selection, but overall I am pleased and I feel I can rely on Amazon's reviewer community. As a former Prime membership customer on Amazon I no longer see any reason to give Jeff Bezos or any of his affiliates or cronies anybody's money. I mean, the man is #1 richest in the world, unless one has a vested interest in displacing the Waltons as the #1 family in the world to hold the Walmart corporations and billions of USD, one should diligently practice the science of skinflintery. I heavily regret any dealings with anyone selling items on this website, and unless anonymous individuals known as 'Michael Deering' want to face me on the defamation lawsuit stand or queue up for a restraining order they should end Amazon's web service support. The warehouses in Amazon power 10,000 lb packing and shipping machines to fill and send the customer packages, to avoid liability and a potential lawsuit, so no one would be any the wiser if an individual's body were placed in a restraining device and thrown violently down the conveyor belt and buried offsite or cremated. Drones flying the skies carry 3,000 lbs. of Amazon merchandise across the skies and it is only a matter of time before they pick someone off or assert non-platonic connections of anyone that they perform surveillance on. Save yourselves and practice the narrowest skinflintery possible, hide your loved ones and stay off the Internet.",2,amazon.com
2708,Site full scammers so beware,2,amazon.com
2709,Prime isn't really a deal. They charge you more and think that we are stupid and fall for it. They are so good at delivering nowadays that prime really isn't worth it. Be smart Americans save your money. Shop around. I bought prime for the grand tour and it SUCKS!!,2,amazon.com
2710,"When does two day shipping not mean two days shipping? It's when you're dealing with Amazon Prime Services. Apparently 2 day shipping with Amazon means we'll kinda sorta maybe get it there in 2 days. Worse is their flippant attitude when questioned about it. Getting these template responses about how they ""personally"" understand but can't do anything about it is insulting. Especially when they forget to change the names in the email.",2,amazon.com
2711,"Not handy at all to buy from Europe. There are tons of products that are US / North America only. The option to only show products that have a shipping to Europe or free shipping does not work properly. A lot of products with no shipping option are still shown. And sometimes the shipping costs outrageously, there should be a proper way to limit to only show shipping for under x amount. Amazon.com also looks like it's been designed in 2001, with buttons all over the place making the site really messy.",2,amazon.com

2714,80 - 90% CSR jobs are outsourced. People answering calls have limited English speaking ability. Hold times are higher. If you like to speak to a manager - expect to wait at least a half an hour on hold and for that person to be a non-native English speaker too. Shipping labels used to be free to return and now they are 1.00. Chinese retailers now selling in America. Lots of fake reviews and low quality products. You order a product and it takes a month to arrive. What is this Alibbaba and Ebay? On some items one day shipping takes four days and the company always has some kind of excuse. Former prime member - no more!!,2,amazon.com
2715,"I will continue to do business with them yet on a restricted basis. Unsure if they bought or just formed a strategic alliance with synchrony bank which issues their Prime Store Card. NOW AMAZON no longer takes paypal as a payment method. Synchrony sends emails not quite daily but often enough to irritate explaining a payment alert. i.e., payment alert in 10 days, payment alert in 8 days. All only adds to incoming spam. So now instead of preferably using Amazon as purchase choice, their affiliation with synchrony has caused me to not choose Amazon where at one time it was a natural choice.",2,amazon.com
2716,"I've been shopping on Amazon almost since their inception back in 1994. My overall experience for the past 20-years has been great. I've had a seller and a buyer account. I've purchased hard to find items at very competitive prices. Up until the past year I've had absolutely no issues. Notably, over the past two-years Jeff Bezos has contracted outside of the USA (Amazon was a Seattle based company) and invested literally BILLIONS of dollars in India. Wow! Not only do I disagree with that (US companies should keep jobs in the US, this is totally selling out), but there's a reason labor is cheaper in India - it's of a lower quality. This is my story. I had signed up for the free 6-month Amazon Prime Student membership. For some reason I forgot to cancel it after the 6-month trial and the $49 membership fee was deducted from my account (no pre-warning this was about to happen). As I didn't want Prime membership I contacted Amazon and cancelled the Prime membership. Two weeks later the same thing happened - another $49 deducted from my bank account for Prime membership. Why? I have no idea. I didn't sign up for Prime again. Not only could this have sent my bank account overdrawn but it was an unauthorized withdrawal of funds from my bank account. Wow! That's usually referred to as 'theft'. I decided to close my Amazon account completely as I did not want to risk this happening again. Now, if you ever want to close your Amazon account you will see that there are no less than 7-steps, plus an email verification process, and then a 24-hour wait with no confirmation email that your account has actually been closed. The process is so convoluted it is literally designed to make closing your account extremely difficult. What a low-ball tactic to keep you. During the process I went online and 'chatted' with customer support. The customer support person I spoke to (Guarab) had a very poor command of the English language and did not offer anything helpful at all. Why would he? He's on the other side of the planet and English is not his first language. I did some research and sure enough (search it up yourself - I just used Wikipedia) between 2014 and 2016 Amazon invested over $5 BILLION DOLLARS in India!!!!  Wow!!! So, Jeff Bezos apparently isn't rich enough (despite his net worth of over $72 BILLION DOLLARS!!!) that he has to take jobs to India instead of investing here in America where he lives and where Amazon was birthed. I despise companies that do that. They're sell outs.  I would have given Amazon a one star review but I'm actually trying to be fair. They served me well for 20-years. It's only been the past year that they've really let me down and, in my opinion, sold out.  Ironically, Jeff Bezos money making strategy of investing in India (let's be honest - it's not because India is a beautiful country, it's exclusively because of the cheap labor force) has backfired on him because now he's lost my custom for life! The few dimes he hoped to save by hiring cheap (and ineffective) labor from India has actually cost him his customer base (in my case at least). Greed is a terrible thing Jeff. You can't take any of it with you. Thanks for selling out.",2,amazon.com

2720,"Amazon used to be one of my favorite places to go online even though the Canadian Amazon is not the US Amazon and it doesn't have the same products nor the same prices but that was ok for the most part and then they changed.  They've gone the route of trying to be another Ebay with 3rd party sellers who try to sell at 2, 3 and more times the average retail prices. The schemers who go there are not reputable and may not even have the items they're trying to sell but that doesn't appear to bother Amazon. I have ordered some products from Amazon, never received a tracking number at least none that you could use. If you shop at Amazon, I would strongly recommend you avoid Amazon Market Place or suffer whatever burns comes with it.  I really don't know what Amazon management was thinking but they have degraded their online shopping to a level I'd prefer to avoid. BestBuy, Staples and many others don't have nor need a Market Place with 3rd party sellers but then you don't need an RMA number to return anything either.  Two stars Amazon and falling fast.",2,amazon.com

2722,First of all in order to refund an item will charge you half the cost of the item and will make you drop it at the UPS store. Second of all they'll drop prices the very next day you buy an item and when you call for a price match they tell you they don't do that anymore. Then when you tell them you won't shop at Amazon ever again because of their bad policies they'll tell you that they don't care. Horrible company/policies.,2,amazon.com
2723,"Since recently, Amazon adopted the practice of cancelling parts of purchase orders. You order 10 items, but if you get 7 of them, you'd better believe you are very lucky. After so many items that failed to deliver, I believe this is a pattern and a conscious business decision. As a result, if the item you are purchasing is a necessity, Amazon is no more a reliable enough place to order there. I am sure there are a number of reliable vendors on Amazon, but overall it is no more nearly as reliable as it used to be.",2,amazon.com

You don't see the estimated delivery date until you are completed your purchase. Last year I was going to school and ordered a text book for a class that was starting in 2 weeks. Schools constantly change text books and don't let you know what they are using with much time. After I finished my course (a month later) I hadn't received my text book and I had to cancel my transaction with my credit card. I couldn't easily find the customer service number in the page. As I was student from an accredited university I registered for the Student Prime account, but they logged me in a trial version of Prime that expired after 3 months. When I called them they said they couldn't correct the classification of my membership until a year later so I couldn't use the benefit of being student as they advertise. Be careful with this site. Good luck.",2,amazon.com

I did not and 5 days later the router still did not ship and still shows in stock. There is absolutely no excuse for this delay in shipping. I could have gotten same day ship for the same price from elsewhere and would have, except I had AMAZON gift cards to use. Disappointed that AMAZON holds your order hostage just to promote selling their PRIME service. Will shop else where going forward. I have had much better customer service from ebay sellers and direct purchase.",2,amazon.com

2740,"I've been using Amazon for years as both a buyer and a seller. Over the last couple of years their shipping has gotten worst and worse and so has their customer service.  The last few items I've ordered from Amazon (not from 3rd party sellers) have been terribly packaged and arrived defective. Amazon does take returns, but shipping it back is a huge hassle and nobody ever bothers to apologize for wasting my time when they send me a broken item. There is nobody held responsible and there's no way to contact them directly if I want to ask for them to package a delicate item more appropriately. On top of the broken items and extra slow shipping, I've recently been locked out of my account because of security issues that they will not clarify. I've called their customer service- and they've been incredibly useless, namely because they're outsourced oversea. Nobody will tell me why I can't get into my account. They tell me they don't know and another department will handle it. I ask to speak to that department and they say they will contact me. It's been days and I've heard nothing. If I didn't have a gift card balance, I'd likely just forget about my account and be done with them. Amazon is a soulless corporation that is responsible for the loss of countless jobs. Saving two or three dollars just isn't worth dealing with them. Support somebody that has a face and cares about their customers instead.",2,amazon.com
2741,"I was looking for a old DVD and I couldn't find it anywhere what at the time, remind you this TV show was from the eighties and they wanted $35 dollars for it. Also I buy a certain soap on line and of course if would be triple what I pay for it at Amazon. Then not all of the items cone in two days as promise. I think the worse thing was when they charge me after I turned the auto renewal off and they charged me anyway but they did return my money along with my bank fees. I would only recommend the free trial",2,amazon.com

2743,"Amazon is ridiculous! If you just want to buy things every now and then, Amazon is fine, but if you would like to sell ANYTHING AT ALL this is NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU! If you are a seller, Amazon will use and abuse you time and time again. Amazon may close your account for absolutely no reason at all! The worst thing is that you will never be able to get anyone to help you get your selling privileges back and they don't care one bit. Lastly, if you don't ship items the way that they prefer (signature confirmation -of course Amazon never explained this to me in time, they waited until something bad happened in order to inform me), you will surely pay for it in the fact that none of your transactions will be covered AT ALL. I sold an item in AUGUST of 2015 and in FEBRUARY of 2016, they decided to claim they never received it (for those doing the math at home, that's SEVEN MONTHS AGO) and Amazon sided with them! I had all the proof I needed, but Amazon didn't care; they said it was insufficient and even though it was that long ago, it made no difference.

Also BE CAREFUL and make sure they DON'T CHARGE YOU TWICE FOR THE SAME ORDER. I honestly believe this is a very ""scammy"" way for them to squeeze a few extra dollars out of people.

After so many years buying from Amazon I can say I will never again buy from them. they are part of system which systematically cheating buyers. claims are always denied. ti is not about the people working at Amazon but their policy.Amazon cheating me after so many years feels like being cheated by a wife. I trusted their system and the credibility. to find later that customers always comes last .suppliers comes first. they take your money. you lay claims and after 3-4 months you get tired you give up and they get your money. my question is. how many people out there who bought from Amazon and didn't receive what they bought and eventually gave up. for me Amazon lost it's credibility.,2,amazon.com
2748,"Amazon used to be a great place to find deals that you could not find at other retailers (online or otherwise.) Amazon Prime was also a great deal. Now prices are bloated and, even with free shipping, the costs are added to the selling price. Hence, no good deal. I have always enjoyed their service and if you are looking for a somewhat obscure or scarce product, it can be a great resource. But, it is incredibly naive to think you will get a deal any longer, unless it is part of year-end holiday special.",2,amazon.com
2749,Amazon is good but not as good as eBay for finding the best deals and for standing behind their vendors if you have a problem with Amazon it's much harder to reconcile a problem which could be because Amazon so you can find things cheaper through the manufacturer then you can through Amazon so they're taking a large part of what you buy and they're not willing to negotiate a solution although you do have the opportunity to return things,2,amazon.com

2751,I purchased a electric skillet pan the price was displayed and then you add postage a total cost of $66.91 wonderful. The invoice reflected this price. Then my bank statement said that the payment to Amazon was $95.01. After I complained and was told that the price was only $66.91 I thought about it and decided that this was the exchange rate conversion to Australian dollars. Amazon would not accept this or issue an invoice with the AU rate. Then I received the product which I can't use because the electrical cord is not suitable and not to Australian standards. Amazon wanted me to pay for the return of the item. UNBELIEVABLE. Very disappointed Amazon,2,amazon.com
2752,The past year I have given most of my business to amazon. I use to be an ebayer but with the fast delivery and competitive prices i had started buying nearly every thing from Amazon. I signed up December of 2014 for prime I didn't realize that once your 30 day free trial ended you would automatically be charged $99 with no prior warning at all no reminder email or anything honestly I hadn't layed much attention to the price or anything of prime because I never intended on paying the price I just saw free w day shipping. So that December I bought christmas from Amazon then I bought everyone's birthdays and through the she year of 2015 I prob spent more than a thousand dollars at amazon this year in 2016 I even started buying some groceries it was then that I thought man this is to good to be true cheap prices fast delivery soooo I dug into my account and found that my husband's card had been charged $104 for prime membership I assume that was our 2nd $104 payment I just missed it last January sooo I got nervous I'm 27 but I swear my blood pressure raised I got hot and red and sweaty so first thing the next morning I called 16 days after the charge appeared on the bank statement and to my surprise the refunded the entire $104 or they said they did I haven't checked at the bank and that was only about 4 or 5 days ago so I thought amazon isn't that bad after all my complaint there was my goodness send an email reminder or something that alerts customers they are about to be charged anyway so my prime membership is canceled I no longer have free 2 day shipping I just use free shipping and it sucks I placed an order for a knife set as a gift and it's been 4 days just processing it hasn't even shipped yet 4 days to process is a very long time in my opinion I think im done with amazon...

I will probably wait till something comes back in stock before I pay more for shipping than I did for the item.",2,amazon.com
2755,"My past experience with Amazon was stellar for years and years. I had to contact them a couple of times but PEOPLE at Customer Service cleared it up. Recently, I ran into 3rd, 4th or ?? party sellers. Amazon became the world's biggest retail store by taking all these unknown 'other sellers' and like OpenSky under their UMBRELLA. Now their customer service can't be found..Again like OpenSky. It takes a miracle like to discover how and where to look. I believe that Amazon is accountable for every seller under their LOGO. With largeness, customer service has tanked into an electronic nightmare for customers. There is no way that I could reach ANYONE to help.....and for the 3rd time I was charged for books I didn't receive. It was Charged-Refund-Recharged. The numerous hours spent trying to contact someone is hard to believe. I didn't reach anyone. All for the same books all paid for but mistakenly shipped again. Not received! I didn't re order duplicates of duplicates!!! If anyone researched the original order they would see that.. They finally refused 15 emails or explanations. There was no profane letters. Nothing like that. I couldn't find an address to write to... and I spent hours researching and writing emails that were rejected until I gave up. (Is this beginning to sound familiar?). I returned the one book sent to me from that first order in early Nov that was out of stock for a long while. I didn't open the box but returned it unopened so I can't say for sure which book it was. I do know it was one book. I don't know how they account for that. Anyway, my new Amazon CC bill came the 8th of this month and there is no mention of what merchandise was charged for but I am recharged!!! For many of the same books. This time I will contact the Visa Amazon card and contest this bill. At least Chase has PEOPLE to talk to and give/receive without the pain of filling out reams of Internet 'help options' and other machines and programs offered. SO WATCH OUT. I think to protect oneself, print out all orders and save papers of proof from Amazon. I didn't. I saved some emails from Amazon. Emails of explanations they won't accept. Emails say refused. ...they don't receive reply's. I am amazed that Amazon can't do decent customer service with ALL their money for World wide jobs... real people to help.

They also sent me a bottle of coogne whose production date was from 2004 (it is now 2015). I bought it DIRECTLY from Amazon and NOT from a third party vendor. NOT what they used to be.",2,amazon.com
2758,"Remember when Amazon gave free shipping at any $25 orders? You've probably noticed that's no longer possible, unless you sign up for Prime. Prime in itself is probably a decent offering; however, not everybody needs or wants it, and therefore you get dinged in shipping costs. (shame on you!) That aside (as I could go on for a while), the main complaint here are sellers using Amazon to sell their goods, let's say used books. These sellers blame Amazon for not allowing them to combine shipping. Is that true Amazon? Where is your voice in all of this? Shipping is $3.99 flat rate for books. Anyone who's ever used USPS Media rates knows that you can ship printed material pretty inexpensively--less than $3.99. If this is true that Amazon won't 'ALLOW' combined shipping, then Amazon is looking for trouble in reduced sales. Just talking locally here with many people who used to use Amazon exclusively, I can tell you they have found other avenues. Also, these sellers put themselves on Amazon.com under multiple different names and then combine shipping for themselves, but never pass on those savings to you, the buyer. Where is Amazon's voice in all of this deceit? Do you like having them try to slip this by you? I think more and more people are going to revert back to buying locally, because the entire online marketing is becoming more dishonest and more of a scam. Keep your eyes open buyers!",2,amazon.com

I'm even starting to regret my Amazon Prime membership. Which by the way keeps changing to auto-renew even though I've changed it.

While, they generally provide a good selling service experience on simple common items, where they fail utterly is trying to understand what would make their customers - better customers on something that requires accurate dimensions, weights, and colors: 1. There is no contact point on the Amazon site for communication regarding Amazon customer service - just third party sellers. 2. Amazon does a miserable job at policing its sellers and their own ads regarding standardizing product descriptions and making sure they are correct. About 80% of Amazon product ads are incorrect or incomplete regarding critical specifications of the their products. I would have much rather dealt with Amazon directly, but again they have no Amazon service feed back or way of reaching customer service directly on their web site. Even though Amazon is clearly successful, as an investor and a customer - I know they could be far more successful if they provided a method and listened to their customers.",2,amazon.com
2767,"The thing that sways me away from ordering things from Amazon is that they do not have a return policy. True that it is great they have a fast shipping and a wide variety of products, but the problem is that they should be enforcing the 30-90 days return policy towards sellers. It would demand that sellers sell legit products that aren't going to break within two weeks. I bought a few things from them and it never lasts more than 2-3 weeks! At walmart, target and any local store would allow for returns if you bought an item that would be defective. I would have just bought it at the store but I am extremely busy, I guess I will have to make time to go and buy the products at the store instead.

2770,"Update from my earlier review of this site giant...My most recent purchases include an audio item, and then the present, a mixed-small-item purchase, still to be delivered. The 1st took 2 tries (warehouse deals) because the 1st didn't operate at all (wasted time!); thankfully, the 2nd was the winner. Then with my present order: Am very frustrated with their present delivery arrangement. I, of course, opted for free ship, which stated 5-8days, but in the process of completing the order, I was immediately informed that it would arrive in 9days- this is fraudulent, and ridiculously long, by today's standards (I shop at many sites). (the audio item took 7 days) Today is over 4 days after I placed the last order, and it hasn't been pulled yet, so I doubt it will arrive on the 9th day. Wasted an hour w/ cust. service (3 reps) who could not accelerate the order (one item would have an increased price), and after all that, would not even issue a courtesy store credit, for the FRAUDULENT advertising, and my wasted time (a small credit was offered in the distant past by their reps). I believe the few customers who haven't paid for Prime Ship are penalized for doing so...all other ""shortcuts"" and customer disservice are apparently needed to fund Bezos' master plan to overtake the world. Their customer service has really disintegrated (the 1st rep who took my call just spouted useless, ""from-their-CS-manual"" platitudes) -- I will place the site on the bottom of my shopping list.",2,amazon.com

2772,"When you search for an item, you can waste hours finding what you want, because there is no policing of the rules. You can get literally thousands of hits that have nothing to do with the keywords you entered. In order to search by price, you must select one of Amazon's often pointlessly similar categories. Then, often, you will get literally thousands of entries that are identical. For many items, you will get thousands of entries that have price $0.01, accompanied by shipping costs of, for example, $10.00. This makes searching by price futile. If you want to skip over these thousands of rule violators, you can't do it because Amazon only lets you skip ahead 2 pages. (Not only that, but they won't let you see more than 25 items per page.) They ought to let you enter the number of the page you want to visit next. I have complained to Amazon numerous times about this, pointing out that the experience at their competitor Ebay, for example, is much better. I have threatened to file criminal complaints against them for being a nuisance. They don't care. The next step would be to be to get millions of Amazon visitors to file complaints with the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general, requesting that Amazon be declared a public nuisance and a public health nuisance, and requiring Amazon to meet reasonable and customary standards before transacting any further business.",2,amazon.com

They appear to be in the market to control the entire online experience which is good and bad. When their investors were paying for the services (their stocks skyrocketed even though they rarely showed profits), they could afford to do this. But now that investors are starting to demand some sort of steady profitability and some return on their investments other than inflated stocks, Amazon looks like they are starting to worry and this is why they tend to manipulate buyer reviews.

It is hard to get hold of the right people when needed or get a response from them. When you contact Amazon with the problem, they always have to ""Investigate"" your claim. My last complaint took over a month, because seller wasn't responding to them either! What was to investigate? I did not receive my merchandise, and I had sent copies of email to Amazon, that I had sent to the seller, trying to resolve the issue, ones which went unanswered to this day!  I finally got a resolution.. It was, ""Okay, here's a refund!""  No reason, no explanation, and no GPS, so my trip had to be cancelled and rescheduled, and a last minute GPS was purchased from another retailer, costing me more than I wanted to pay and that it was worth, because I was left in the lurch. To add insult to injury, Amazon is still allowing this seller to sell on their site.  Amazon prices are not what they used to be and the shipping costs will eat you up!

If Amazon Prime Video sent out a notice saying I had to watch the whole video in one day, they didn't tell me.

The 3rd video was UNAVAILABLE! Hey, Amazon, that's not RIGHT TO DO! These were all either really old movies from the '90's or kind of jerky movies that the Sci-Fy channel used to show. That's another thing about Prime Videos-no current or recently current movies. That doesn't bother me, but when they are starting to shut off my access to the ends of movies, THAT ISNT RIGHT! As for Amazon as a whole, I use it to buy almost everything. I recommend that you always look to make sure each purchase is ""Fulfilled by Amazon"" before you buy it. I made a couple purchases that weren't all that great, and Amazon made sure I got a refund. Quickly, too. There are many sponsored items now, and most sellers are ethical and decent.

As an Entrepreneur, I have a webstore on Amazon which has proved to be a nightmare. Firstly, inventory between .CA and .US is considered separate. So in order for your products to climb the page rankings, although you have listings that pertain to both Canada and USA, only sales from each country will help you climb your rank-individually. This makes it extremely competitive.  Also, setting up the page was very difficult. There was no customer service. The account manager simply told me to watch a ""tutorial.""

It turned out that all my inventory got sent to Amazon's warehouse where they ended up losing the inventory, and once found, refused to store it for Amazon fulfillment, because our product bottles where ""oversized,""-something they did not worn use about beforehand!  The point is, as customer buying products Amazon is decent, but as someone trying to sell products (business seller's account), make sure you do your homework in advance and DO NOT rely on your account manager to help you out!",2,amazon.com
2794,"(Fifth update.) I've been purchasing from Amazon fairly heavily for years, not because I think it's the best source for merchandise (although it often is) but because its gift cards are the reward of choice for my participation answering queries for helpowl.com [which I've also reviewed for SiteJabber]. Pluses: 1. Price. Prices are generally excellent, and some purchases are tax-free. Many items are ""eligible for free shipping,"" meaning that Amazon will not charge for shipping such items if their total price in one order is $25 or more.  2. Return policy. Return policies are easy and quite generous, and with items shipped by Amazon the company pays for return shipping, or may even waive the need to return the item at all. 3. Promptness. Shipping is always prompt, even when free. Minuses: 1. Support. I've now downgraded my star rating because of the increasingly terrible customer service. The good news is that phone support is usually, perhaps always, available. The bad news is the quality of that support: (a) Thick accents by agents apparently based in other countries--even supervisors--make their advice largely unintelligible. (b) Even when one can understand them, too many of the support personnel seem entirely clueless, taking the customer's time to no good end. Escalating to a supervisor sometimes works but often does not; and written support, usually provided as boilerplate, is usually still worse. (c) Inquiries to Amazon's sellers must almost always be made via Amazon's online form; and, incredibly, Amazon cannot track such inquiries or follow up unless the purchase has already been made. 2. Product descriptions. These are wrong much too often.  3. Product search. The variety of products available is overwhelming, and Amazon's product search engine is awful. For example, a search for a ""queen-size single fitted sheet"" yielded many hundreds of results (as I recall, about 1,400!), pointing to sheets of various sizes, nearly all sheets sets. Of all those results I found only 1 that matched my search criteria. One suspects that Amazon deliberately fudges search results to offer more choices, with the goal of increasing sales. 4. Merchant reviews. As of last check Amazon allows reviewers without significant limitation to withdraw their reviews. This policy encourages merchants -- many of whom depend on Amazon for patronage -- to go after reviewers whose reviews are not favorable in order to buy them off. This has happened to me. The consequence of these minuses is that you could easily spend hours trying to meet your need, which may in the end be unfulfilled or, even worse, fulfilled badly.",2,amazon.com

You have to deauthorize computers that are essentially the same 1-2 computers you always use.

If something goes wrong with your order, it is hard to find where to contact someone.",2,amazon.com

The only recourse I had was to unwrap the Christmas presents, repackage them and return them for a refund. Then I could repurchase the exact items at the lower price, less the shipping cost of returning them of course. They would also take 2-3 weeks to process the refund, tying up my $640 during the Christmas season. I should have investigated before I purchased, nowhere on their site do they mention price guarantees, so I guess it is Caveat Emptor on me, but still a very frustrating situation.",2,amazon.com

The games are gone ..... Amazon suggests I contact the game developers to get game data back. They have no idea how the Kindle got unregistered .... they don't have the capability to find out. BUT they did offer to compensate me for my inconvenience for hours of troubleshooting over the phone .... they offered to credit my account $10, which I declined. The net is that Amazon technical support is purely clerical ..... they have a script for  getting a customer running ..... at ground zero and that's all!!!! And they have no way for a customer to do their own backups ..... And they suggested I caused the problem ... even though it would have taken 4 steps for me to reset ..... and I would have ignored several warnings that data would be destroyed ..... I only signed on (no password problems) .... and was met with an empty system. Usually talking to a supervisor brings a new perspective .... but not with technical support ..... the answers were the same script .... clearly they have no technical skills ..... they did not even opening a problem.

2811,They use bait and switch tactics on their free shipping.

Get your stuff directly from the vendor!",2,amazon.com
2814,"Amazon used to be my go-to place to save money and avoid going into shops (and pay for their rent!), but now there are so many different sellers and prices that you can no longer trust that you are getting a good deal. The same item can be priced *very* differently depending on the seller. Some prices are also absolutely ludicrous. For instance, I saw that someone was trying to sell the academic book that I authored for $1k !! It costs $100 directly from the publisher?! Shocking, to say the least. So although they have fantastic delivery and customer services, you constantly need to research whatever you wish to buy to make sure that you are not getting fooled. It's very tiring and time-consuming. There is absolutely no price regulation - you alone decide what you are willing to pay to get something delivered and/or rare. So prices don't match quality; rather, they reflect availability and the sheer greed of sellers. And they are killing our high street shops...",3,amazon.com

2817,"Their mobile website is almost impossible to use and their desktop site is not a whole lot better. Their customer service doesn't know what its own policies are and finding product information is almost impossible as customers who have no ability and/or interest in providing coherent input post on Amazon's ""customer reviews"" section of a product page and to make it more cumbersome, the reviews for all 400 of the 500 variations of Michael Jackson's THRILLER are grouped together with no easy way to tell many of them apart. More, even if you know EXACTLY which one you're looking for, you can type in its' barcode and still have to go through a multistep process to get to the item page you explicitly searched for. And the other 100 variations of Michael Jackson's THRILLER are just like stray cats with no way to distinguish between them except the ASIN which is nothing except a # that Amazon uses to identify the item in question when someone asks about it. Except most of these ASINs are for items that were long out of print before Amazon even existed and only exist because someone created an item page for it for who knows what reason, maybe to sell it on the Amazon Marketplace, and many of these ASINs go long abandoned.  Amazon remedies this tangled mess of a website by refunding your money no matter whose fault the issue is. It doesn't matter if the 3rd part seller screwed up, the post office or a gremlin. It's been refunded so all is well. Until next time.",3,amazon.com

Today is Dec.19th and product is to to arrive Dec. 26th.Thought I should have it in two days seeing as I pay for Prime and it said two day shipping at checkout but also said arrives after Xmas Dec 26th. Spoke with a supervisor and she informed me the two day Prime shipping guarantee is from the day it is shipped and does not include the order filling process. Could possibly take much longer than two days. She stated the guarantee is for two days from shipping date not order date.

And Amazon Makes It Very Hard For People Like Me To Voice Our Point Of View. On Products We Have Try and Tested. Amazon is Deleted so many People Reviews Over Some Dumb Stuff.

I Mean WTF Are They Talking About??? What if that person don't have a Relationship with the seller and all that BS? I Feel That Amazon is so wrong on that.

2831,"I must admit I have a hidden agenda. I posted two reviews and I was shocked to see a 180k views. I was angry but I never wanted to shame this company before the world like that. I think there should be a time limit on all reviews. People change and companies too. We need to forgive even as we want to be forgiven. Life happens but thanks God it is not always the end of the world, yet. So here - today I want to share a little bit of good news and common sense for all you online shoppers and people looking for that opportunity to get out of the mess you find yourselves in. We all struggle but it is when you are poor and needy and in debt that the pressures really hit home and where hopelessness tries to kill the joy of living. Everybody knows or want to know some kind of secret to making money and to be successful. A wise man listens to counsel but too many voices will drive you mad. Do you prefer the paperless route to getting rich quick, or do you have a proper plan to prosper that will make you rich? Countless money making offers and investment opportunities floats out there both online and offline. But for your own peace of mind and safety, it is most advisable to Google search different reviews on each selected choice before signing up or buying in. Many come with that deceitful free label that stings, like a hook to the bait. Often people are invited to financial seminars to help them cope or escape their current state of affairs into a Utopia, a lifestyle of milk and honey. And like any good business, they do require you to invest time and money. And as for good farming, it is essential to prepare the soil for sowing and reaping, which may take months and even years to fully mature. But dont despair, hard work has its rewards.  But it is in these hard times when the vulnerable and desperate are lured with fast food cash-ins and drive off scams. Most offers are so tempting it's hard to resist, and when swallowed it has that bittersweet ending. Just like, when the serpent deceived Eve with his cunning sales act. Did God really say that? Its because he doesn't want you to become like gods too. Just try it once, no one will know! And when she saw that the fruit was good to eat, she ate of the forbidden tree of knowledge of good and evil. Then she also gave to her husband, and when he took his first bite, the whole world went into a total Black-Out. And instead of becoming like gods, they got caught naked and hiding from God. This is a clip out of the book God and Money now available. It is a world of wisdom for one happy meal.

Secondly they have too many fakes on the site, sure I can get my money back, but I dont want to have to go through the hassle. I want to buy a product that is great not one that looks great but works terribly. Now overseas firms are hiring SEO specialists that game the system and allow inferior products to rank higher or at least thats my take. This means a company can make a knockoff product sell it for ¼ of the price and rank higher. Who do you think the average Joe is going to buy from? Amazon needs to go after counterfeiters with a bigger stick",3,amazon.com

I do not think that they find the best deals for me and their search options are not helpful to narrow the search to the items you are seeking. Often I have seen that an items is advertised at a lower price than you end up paying and that is annoying. For example, you find a hat and the small size is cheap but the medium size is 2x the price of the small. There is not reason for such a price difference. Other times you see something for $4 and click on it only to find that the $4 is not an option at all and the cheapest color/size/etc is $6 for example soo.......find what you need and then still price compare.",3,amazon.com

I did receive the product a month later but I'm not happy with the experience",3,amazon.com
2859,"Loved Amazon for many many years. Since Prime came along it became harder and harder as non-prime member to make purchases; to the point that I no longer make purchases from Amazon. I have reverted to using Ebay, Walmart Online, and alternate sites for products I want which Amazon will only sell as a prime product.This is the case with any new order now. There will always be one prime item not available, unless you are prime member. For prime members I am sure this is satisfactory. However, I can not justify prime membership.",3,amazon.com
2860,"Amazon has a lot to offer, that's for sure. However, I try not to order much that's either sold/shipped by Amazon or fulfilled by Amazon because they play too much with their shipping.  The last few orders I placed on Amazon that were either sold/fulfilled by Amazon took longer than a week just to get shipped. Most businesses can manage to ship out in-stock items in one business day, two tops. However, I've had Amazon wait 9 business days to ship, while my order's status has said ""preparing for shipment"" for 4 days. As I'm not Prime member, I feel like they do this on purpose so you'll have to wait upward of a week to get your items because they know that if they ship your items out the next business day, USPS will usually deliver in about 3 days, so why pay for Prime for a one day difference? I never have this issue when I order items sold by a third party. I've even called Amazon about why it was taking days to ""prepare my shipment"" but even they couldn't tell me why or even what the real status of my order was. Oddly enough, after first telling me that my order didn't go through due to a server issue to the items just not being in stock, about one hour later, my order shipped out from a city about 60 miles away from me. My order was delivered the next morning in a box that was way too big and not even taped all the way shut. Order from trusted third-party sellers. You'll have the best experience that way if you're not a Prime member.",3,amazon.com
2861,Hate that it doesn't ship to all countries. Wanted to send a present straight to my friends and couldn't,3,amazon.com
2862,"Amazon is a great website that sells things for cheap. I have ordered many things off of Amazon and I have only had two problems with the site. The first problem, is that I ordered an item for a gift to my father. In the description it told me that it was a 1000 lumen flashlight (very bright). When I finally received it in the mail ( around a month later ) it was nowhere near 1000 lumens. It was MAYBE around 50 lumens. We were both very disappointed considering I spent $20 on a flashlight I could buy at a gas station. The other problem is shipping. I have ordered some items and they have came in around 3 days later and then I have had items that have came in around 2 MONTHS later. Overall, they are a good site but you have to watch out for false advertisement and make sure that you'll be okay with waiting months to receive your package .",3,amazon.com
2863,Amazon is slower shipping since creating Amazon Prime. If you don't have Prime it can take up to 2 weeks to receive order,3,amazon.com
2864,"I think Amazon is gonna change retail in a way we cannot understand. It is good for the consumer, that is without question. But, in the end, will it be good for our economy (business'), and our culture? I have my doubts.",3,amazon.com
2865,I use amazon about once every couple months and so far I have liked it. Some prices are better than others so I have to check around to make sure I am getting a decent deal.,3,amazon.com
2866,I am very much convened that amazon gives product at very low price but some of there clothing apparel does't have that much quality as they quote.,3,amazon.com
2867,I live in a town in CO for a few months of the year and even though I pay for PRIME Amazon shops to my post office rather than UPS to my home where UPS Is available from other shippers. This is a sneaky way to collect for 2 day shipping and use the inefficient post office for final destination. Walmart delivers to my home ....much better.,3,amazon.com
2868,"I ordered online.....ONCE. I'm kind of unsure when I will again. Bought a Sim card for an iphone 4s once....and the seller said it should fit.....IT DIDN""T.",3,amazon.com

2870,"My one complaint is that when I order from Amazon, I never know when (or if) my item will arrive. In one case, I waited two months and then received a ""Sorry- out of stock"" email.  A friend of our family ordered a Halloween costume that arrived in December. The seller was in North America too.",3,amazon.com
2871,It used to be that Amazon had what I wanted and at the best price. Either they have dropped standards or everyone has caught up. I still shop there but they don't get all of my money now. I bought a Samsung tablet yesterday and beat Amazon's price by $100.,3,amazon.com
2872,Have had the best experiences with textbook rentals and some pet meds but otherwise I avoid the site.,3,amazon.com
2873,"And that flaw is shipping. out of all the variants in Europe yes I live in a small EU country in the east Med, but most EU shops won't ship to me, so I order something on Amazon.co.uk because the other .de, .es, .fr, .it are all country specific and won't ship to Cyprus despite being closer that the UK, so I hit checkout on a board game that costs £19 and before I hit confirm I see shipping is £49 for standard shipping!?!?!? so until Amazon gets the shipping in Europe method down I won't be shopping here unless I absolutely need the item. You question me back by saying well order form another site and you will see Shipping is just as expensive? my answer is sadly no this is not the case. The same board game I found on a game site from Germany and they shipped it to me for £10 DHL. so no not the same boat.",3,amazon.com
2874,"Its pretty good if you need a specific book for a class, or are looking for an old CD but otherwise I just don't get it. I'm a die hard eBay fan. Maybe it's because I can actually see what I'm buying and not some crappy stock photos. But I suppose it's awesome for shut ins that need a lot of toilet paper.",3,amazon.com
2875,"I've found things in their daily deals, continue shopping to get to the free shipping limit, and then lose the sale price. Very aggravating. Also, I don't like them saving my credit card info. I've bought 2 ""free"" books that weren't free anymore and didn't see it in time to stop clicking the button. Once you click, you've paid $4 or $5 for a ""free"" ebook.",3,amazon.com
2876,average service and lagging behind eBay in customer care - bought an item using FBA and really not a good service - only thing that saved them and gave 3 stars is that i bought a business on amazon and know I can do better for my customers learning from their mistakes - they did fix it in the end so 3* it is .,3,amazon.com
2877,I've always been a loyal member since day one of the launch and even when they raised their membership prices I still kept being a customer. After 10 years I just recently was banned from doing reviews with no apparent reason as to why. I enjoy leaving reviews so that others can tell to buy or not to buy based on how the product worked for me and now I can't anymore voice my opinions. I will not be renewing my membership and will turn my money over to either jet.com or will use any other site than Amazon. It is bittersweet as Amazon is getting worst with hiring regular people to deliver who shouldn't be delivering to people's houses without a proper background check but it's not my business so I don't care. I value 1st amendment rights and it seems that Amazon will have non of that. So if you want competition prices by not have an opinion then go with this site.,3,amazon.com
2878,"It gets really confusing and wasteful to have multiple boxes received over time. I would rather have one box with everything ordered. Also, I am really picky about what I buy, so sometimes Amazon reviews indicate that what was received was different than what was pictured. They also take a long time to receive the items when you get free shipping, not the case with Walmart.com. If you want a book quicker, Barnes and Noble.com for a small delivery charge.",3,amazon.com
2879,Make sure to always compare prices against Amazon online on google because I've noticed Amazon mostly over prices their products to get that prime 2 day shipping. But sometimes they are the better deal so just price shop,3,amazon.com

2884,"most amazon items are good and usually get fast shipping. But dare to rate a purchase less than 4 it will not be shown. How deceitful is that. I want to know what people have to say about the product. not just all good things.  Then I can make an educated guess.  They used to offer free shipping, now they don't and the site is misleading because it tells you free shipping until you go check out and find out differently.",3,amazon.com

2888,the most important thing i don't like Amazon is that the delivery charges are too high. initially the charges were good n very affordable but now i stooped buying anything because of that. ya i love the site but the returning policy is also bad . they don't care about the complaint of people,3,amazon.com
2889,A lot of small businesses had to go away for this megacomany to be 1 trillion dollars. A lot. Kind of sad.,3,amazon.com
2890,"Prices are cheap, butI feel like it's become too big for its own good now. Amazon's own delivery service is absolutely dire and always lies that you were in when they tried to deliver, and their customer support can be a bit frustrating as English is not their first language.",3,amazon.com
2891,"I often shop at smile.amazon.com (this site gives a percentage of your purchase to charity), but I've learned to always double check prices from Amazon vendors -- some of them try to rip you off.

2892,"I used to buy used copies of books that my kids wanted to read so that I could save $$.

2894,Their selection and prices are pretty good.They just don't have the buyer protection that Ebay gives you.,3,amazon.com
2895,Gotta use Amazon these days as they do set the standard for fast delivery time. THAT IS IF YOU HAVE A GOOD LOCAL DRIVER. So many temporary or sh1tty drivers who can't give a rats ass if they deliver your parcel next day or not. Good prices when shopping around and okay returns policy. Tho do check some independent retailers dont follow amazon's strict returns procedure.,3,amazon.com

2897,you can find just about anything on this site it's not always cheaper so do your research read the shipping details carefully,3,amazon.com
2898,"Amazon has the widest selection of goods in the world, and it usually has competitive prices. But a policy they appear to have implemented in the last year or so drags my rating well down. They seem to be trying to push people to pay for shipping (through either Prime or per-order paid shipping) by seriously degrading the free shipping. This is the way I normally order. Every order I have placed in the last year has not been shipped for at least 6 days, and usually more (my last order was 8 days ago, and it hasn't shipped yet), after I placed the order. The shipping itself is fast, always 1-2 days, so they aren't using a cheaper shipping method to save costs. But they hold your order for about a week before processing and shipping it so normally you will receive it 8-10 days after you place your order. Many other online outlets offer free shipping without this kind of delay (and some of them at about the same price for the merchandise). So Amazon is now a clearly inferior online shopping site with respect to free shipping.",3,amazon.com
2899,They've sent me broken products & products that weren't mine because I didn't order said item. Wrong deliveries.,3,amazon.com
2900,"I was a huge amazon fan and spent a lot of money there as a prime member-its getting harder to contact a human when there is a problem, the do sell everything but you have to be careful because some of their ""vendors"" are pretty shady-one thing they do have is a great extended warranty company ""fair trade"" I highly recommend them-for many things you can do better elsewhere-their grocery delivery program is a total joke unless you are a rich rock star",3,amazon.com
2901,"I used to love Amazon. From 2006 to 2014 we were inseparable. Then, I started having issues. Prior to 2014, 99 % of my MANY orders came via UPS. I moved into town from the rural outskirts in 2014. My orders were then predominantly coming via United States Postal Service and therein was part of the reason I down rated them in this review. Orders are frequently delivered to wrong addresses, or not delivered at all. It has been a pain. I have begged Amazon to use UPS or FedEx for my orders. They refuse. Also, I started questioning the prices. I am not talking about the resellers, as they can price as absurdly as they wish. I mean items sold and shipped by Amazon: Dawn Dishwashing Liquid, 32.4 ounce is $3.99 in local and other online stores, but Amazon is asking $11.99 for the exact same thing. And that is just one of many examples I've found recently. I still love Amazon, but they are going to have to tighten up the ship as competition is growing. They must stop promising free shipping then charging me three times the market price. And they need to dump the USPS.",3,amazon.com
2902,I think that they can open up to other locations around the globe as well. It would prove being an excellent opportunity because that would allow them to enhance their game. The competitive prices are attractive.,3,amazon.com
2903,only slight problems with them occasionally. Usually will take care of it in a fairly quick manner though.,3,amazon.com
2904,"I'm a member of Prime and a routine shopper. Unfortunately, Amazon no longer has my back. The quality of goods is not consistent. They no longer back the consumer as they sell inferior products. Granted the price is low but poor quality means the consumer pays. It's important to be careful when you select.",3,amazon.com
2905,"Amazon is the place I primarily go for product reviews, then buy them elsewhere. Amazon never really seems to offer great deals unless you have Amazon Prime, in which case you would want to use it very regularly for it to become worth the yearly fee. Once in a while, I'll find something on Amazon that has a cheaper price than eBay or other random websites I find through Google Shopping, but probably 3 out of 4 times, I find that their prices are higher than the super discounted prices you can find on eBay, and are more on par with your local department stores. I also almost never find free shipping an option on Amazon, but you see it all the time on eBay. The only thing Amazon has going for them is the convenience factor of buying online, and of course a ton of product reviews to narrow down what you're looking for. Fortunately for me, I've been buying online well before Amazon became a big thing and I know of other places to grab good stuff for a fraction of the price.",3,amazon.com

2909,"I've ordered a lot from Amazon over the years, used to love them, but policies have changed. Maybe just too big and don't know how to manage it. Just yesterday I had an order from a vendor needed to be canceled. The vendor sent an email that said no problem, I'd bought from them before. At the same time received one from Amazon saying it was shipped. On Sunday? Still have not received an answer to correct status. The main issue with Amazon though is their free shipping. You have to buy so much to qualify, an amount they raise at times. Yet if you take advantage of this your order goes to the back of the line. Not always do they meet the promised shipping date if it takes too long, they just change it. This has happened every time it seems like. It's taken up to a week before for an item to ship out when choosing free shipping, but if you use a debit card they bill you when an order placed, not when shipped as most vendors do. Vendors have an authorization when placing an order so payment guaranteed until shipped, then hard charge, but Amazon actually runs it through now when order placed. Maybe they know it may take a week to ship. They've actually acknowledged using free shipping makes it a low priority order. Only if a private vendor ships themselves does it go out faster.They're CS is apparently outsourced which at times makes it hard to communicate. Just not the same Amazon it once was.",3,amazon.com
2910,Amazon is great but when shipping something back for a refund some times they do 3-5 different refunds amount for one transaction it's very hard to keep track and sometimes refund don't even show up,3,amazon.com

2912,"I bought an electronic device off a seller on Amazon. They had very little experience on Amazon but the price was right so I ordered a device. It was charged to my credit card immediately and shipped to New York instead of Texas where I live. Tracking in Amazon showed delivered to Texas. Tracking in UPS showed New York. Something very fishy about it because seller refused to respond to emails. It took almost 3 weeks to get my refund on my credit card. I told Amazon that this was fraud, but they seemed very unconcerned at first. I should not had to go to as much effort as I did to get my money back.",3,amazon.com

Ebay said they would refund my money but I have not seen the refund yet or the product. The second company is Canserin through Amazon. The product received is defective and it took about 5 weeks to deliver, but the company wants me to send photos of the product and the package it came in before sending a replacement. And I would have to wait another 5 weeks.  I no longer have the option of sending pictures since uploading Safari on my Mac. I contacted Amazon but all they can/will do is send an email to the company. I believe both products are from China but Hommee-fashion501 has a California location. Not sure about Canserin's location. I will no longer purchase anything from China or from either of these companies.",3,amazon.com

Then I got an email back from the third party seller stating that amazon was responsible for shipping and I would need to contact amazon about a lost product. This company just wanted a positive review for a missing purchase. If amazon is responsible for selling, acquring, and shipping the item to me, why does this third party company need my email? If I so choose to leave a review, that is my business.

I also bought some makeup from a brand I usually buy at the mall, and it was crumbly and hard, and it smelled weird. What's frustrating is that even after contacting Amazon about these scammers, Amazon continues to let them sell their bogus products!",3,amazon.com

They still provide fair value and a decent customer experience BUT now (I) non-prime delivery times are intentionally delayed; (Ii) the minimum purchase required for free delivery is up; and (III) pricing is no longer reliably competitive. For many items, Jet.com provides a better experience - on all of cost, minimum purchase for free delivery and speed of delivery (in NYC, often next day.). The selection is way narrower but it offers a significantly better experience if they carry what you want. It seems evident that these policies are designed to push customers to subscribe to Amazon Prime. That is fair as a business model, but it may not be fair as a competitive model.",3,amazon.com

2938,"Amazon customer service is good. They have generally refunded, replaced and apologised in a timely way when required. The reason I look elsewhere before buying from them is the way they treat their employees. We have all seen news items about conditions in their fulfillment centres, many of us know a self-employed driver who has been driven mad and had to throw in the towel. Some of us have seen their employment contracts, or the contracts their chosen temp agencies impose. Basically, if you're a potential customer they love and respect you, but if you're a worker they exploit you. Now, a bit of a dogleg here admittedly, but it occurred to me that they sell lots of music, film, books etc.. The creative souls who make this stuff can get famous, they can get knighted, they can work in TV, radio, the media, they win awards AND THEY OFTEN HAVE LIFE STYLES THAT INCLUDE LOTS OF BOOZE AND DRUGS, but if you wanna work for them and you've had a happy fag in the last six months you can get lost. Hypocrisy. And horrible hubris. Look somewhere else first. Just USE Amazon like they USE people.",3,amazon.com
2939,"I shop at Amazon.com because it has such a variety of choices of products. However, that same variety means that they deal with a large number of venders, and follow-up on damaged or missing packages is almost non-existent.

If the postman sees the package in the mailbox before I do, the package is confiscated and I have to pay postage on it - again! I have tried several ways of trying to contact Amazon.com about this problem and have been ignored.

I would rather a much lower yearly rate just to get regular free shipping. So as of now I comparison shop and buy most of my stuff elsewhere online. And still use Amazon for the product reviews.,3,amazon.com

2953,"I mainly just publish comic strip books for free with them now. Although you can generate 70 % of what you charge for your books in sales by choosing the 70-percent option for the $2.99-$9.99 range, overall sales have plummeted for me here the last four years plus they don't provide your views tally; consequently, I had to move most of my books to another market. On the bright side, you can possibly get a $1500 advance by using their Kindle Scout program as a member; however, your submission must have at least 50,000 words and fall into a certain category. Minus getting a sale, you will generate revenue for each page of one of your books that someone reads on their Kindle but it is usually pennies literally. I give them strong credit for publishing your submission within 12 hours.",3,amazon.com
2954,"I recently ordered two laptop bags from Amazon India but finally they delivered only one. Once I contacted them, I got to know that their vendor shipped only one, and they refunded my money. It was ok to get the money back but that was not what I wanted, I wanted 2 bags.",3,amazon.com
2955,"True, you can find just about anything at Amazon, as well as an amazing variety of things, but shipping costs are so high, and many times you need to go through the purchasing sequences to find out what exactly the shipping charges will be. And should you want to contact the sell, you need to DIG to find their contact info! Lately, more and more sellers aren't even in the USA, something you might not find out until after the purchase. I wish Amazon was more transparent with providing information.",3,amazon.com

2957,"Since Amazon attempts to be a one-stop shop, you don't always get the best. Third party vendors make it more difficult to shop for or return items because each seller has different policies regarding shipping. It's not all upfront, and the appearance of the Amazon site doesn't change when you pick items from vendors versus Amazon. Like there's no signal that says, ""Hey, you're buying from Amazon, you're buying from BooksAhoy, CrapShoesAlabama, and ConnorY1983. Is that ok? They will charge you for shipping, they will charge you to return the items you buy, and these guys ARE NOT fulfilled by Amazon."" Also, Amazon desperately wants you to be a Prime Member, raising the cost of free shipping from $25 to $35 to $49. Now, that doesn't include books, either. You have to spend $25 on books alone to get free shipping on books. And still find stuff adding to $49 to get free shipping on the entire order, that is if you don't have Prime. It's just not customer-friendly anymore.",3,amazon.com
2958,Why do they have to charge so much for delivery? Other apps are a lot cheaper.,3,amazon.com

Amazon Prime is good if you order online frequently, but it was pretty useless for entertainment. Plus I didn't like that they don't warn you when your trial period is about to end. A busy person like me tends to forget about small things like movie subscriptions. Good thing I didn't actually use it and got my money back.",3,amazon.com

2965,"Amazon, like Google and Adobe, is trying to take over your lifestyle by moving you from a buyer to a subscriber. They are attempting to get you hooked on a regular basis so that they, I assume, can grow their companies into power house players by setting a core customer base and by having direct access to your money supply. Amazon was an excellent company, but today it's personality has changed from helping us to simply a company of self-greed. Watch out what you buy and more importantly how you are engineered to buy from Amazon. Also, don't try to communicated with them. They don't want to hear from you. If you do break through that maze and get a note to them, the response will come from India or Pakistan and not be directed at your actual question. The company is now facing competition from a few others like jet.com. But each of these has not equaled the power of the amazon Web site. When they do,they might prove to be a bit better than Amazon. But Amazon right now, owns the world and is behaving as though they own us along with it.",3,amazon.com

That is just the tip of the iceberg. Use it long enough and you will find a ton of holes in the way they do business. Prices are not always the best. Sometimes Amazon Prime prices will be higher then non-Prime prices. They are good, but it is still very much buyer beware.",3,amazon.com
2968,I use Amazon a lot - the prices are usually great and sometimes exceptional. But when it screws up it is a nightmare.  I wrote an entire blog post about one experience. http://yasashiikuma.com/2016/05/score-u-haul-1-amazon-0/ Three months later I have never heard back from them.,3,amazon.com
2969,"Amazon Prime used to ship via UPS. When the switched to using USPS, they made a big mistake in meeting the needs of their customers. I purchase ALOT from Amazon. Their prices can be good (not always) but for me it saves time and it's convenient. Or at least it used to be. I live in a rural town in a heavily populated county. USPS delivers mail to mailboxes on the street, not door to door. Even with a large mailbox, packages don't fit. The 2 day shipping turns to 5 days because I have to travel to the Post Officeto pick up packages. It's an easy 20 minutes each way to pick up packages between 9-5:00 ( if there is no commute traffic to deal with.). That doesn't work when a person is employed. UPS delivers to my door, but not USPS. My Prime membership comes with other perks; such as free movie streaming. I can't use any of the other perks because of having Satelite Internet and data limits. I'll continue to use Amazon because of the size of their selections and and the ease of ordering. I hate that they use USPS and if there was a better alternative to Amazon, I'd take it.",3,amazon.com
2970,"I love their website, prices and selection. I can find things on Amazon that are not available anywhere else. I hate that because I am not a ""Prime"" member they process my orders very slowly. Also some items are not available for me to purchase unless I am a Prime member. I also have a problem with some of the items I have bought have been shipped directly from China. They never tell you in advance that it will take two months to get your item because it is coming directly from China. If I knew ahead of time I would purchase somewhere else.",3,amazon.com
2971,"I won't pay for Amazon Prime, so I guess that makes me a second class customer; three days after placing an order for ""in stock"" merchandise they have not pulled it; meanwhile another online supplier has already fulfilled my order, place at the same time as Amazon, while I wait for some sign of life from Slo-mo-zon. Too rich, too big. The Power of Sitejabber! About one hour after posting this review I ""suddenly"" got 2 email notifications that my Amazon order shipped! Scarily interesting or coincidental...you be the judge. Thanks SJ & Amazon.",3,amazon.com
2972,"Have purchased from Amazon for years! Sometimes their prices are higher than others, but when that happens I will purchase that item from somewhere else. The only thing I do not care for is how often the prices do change. I recently purchased an item there and noticed a short time later that it had dropped by $20.00 That is a lot of money to me, and I feel like I got ripped off. Doesn't seem right to me...",3,amazon.com
2973,"Amazon.com prices are going up and up... Why? I've been shopping on Amazon.com for more than a decade now. However, in the last couple of years, their prices have been surging up well above the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) on many items. It used to be that they had the lowest prices on most anything. Now, that is not the case and I am very leery when I shop on Amazon.com  Just this week, I walked through retail shops like Bed, Bath and Beyond, (certainly not a bargain store) and checked prices on Amazons site on my smartphone while in the shop. I found BBBs prices (before discount) were significantly lower (40% lower on some items) than Amazon's best ""prime members only"" prices. Yes, Amazon's price was nearly double the price of some items at BBB. Every item I looked at was priced lower than the best Amazon.com's price from any seller thereon. And again, that is before factoring in a 20% added discount at BBB.  When I go to some manufacturer's websites, I find their MSRP is significantly lower than Amazon's best prices. For example, just today I found the Navy Sport-Brella Versa-Bella priced at $26 on Amazon.com when it can be purchased directly from the manufacturer for $20. That same umbrella is available at many other retail stores and websites for the same $20, but Amazon.com wants an extra 30% above MSRP. Why??? And now with Amazon's $49 minimum for free shipping, I am looking at other options and away from their greed-driven ways. I understood when it went from $25 to $35 (times change; shipping costs go up). But then it jumped to $49 in no time. While other companies are lowering their minimum purchase for free shipping, Amazon is raising theirs.  Frankly, with Amazon.com's jacked-up prices, it's getting harder and harder to find $50 worth of items that I want on their website that I can't get elsewhere for less money. What happened, and why such a significant greed-driven shift in the last year or two, Amazon? How much profit is really enough, Mr. Bezos??? My suggestion to other shoppers: Do what Im now doing Check and compare prices in local retail shops and/or on other websites before you buy from Amazon.com. While Amazons prices are still better on some items, their prices on other items may give you severe sticker shock. In the end you may be surprised to learn that Amazon.com is not the bargain store it used to be.",3,amazon.com

They lump all reviews for similar models, some models are vastly different in specs and configuration. You could have one model that is great and another model that is a POS but Amazon lumps them together and you don't know until someone posts a model number in their review. You will think a item is great when it is known to be defective. Amazon is well aware of this issue but will not do anything about it. Don't ever use Amazon Services. First off, Amazon techs are subcontractors, nothing more. We have never set foot in a Amazon facility. Amazon does not actually vet their technicians. They have changed policies so many times due to techs going onsite drunk/high and stealing/breaking things at customers sites. I don't doubt that Amazon fixes all the issues but some items are not replaceable. Issues with businesses quoting one price then jacking it up when they get onsite. Amazon returns are great, Customer service is great IF YOU USE THE PHONE. Email support is terrible, just like everyone else. Cut and paste responses that have no bearing on your issue.",3,amazon.com

Amazon promised me a pristine new copy for a king's ransom, I paid close to fifty bucks for a single movie, I know, stop laughing, when it arrived it looked like a whole drawer's worth of silverware had fallen on it. The circular scratches covered it completely, I never play the return game, in Amazon's defense, perhaps they would have corrected it. Unfortunately and, conveniently coincidentally, it just happened to be the last 'new' one they had. Now you see why I didn't try, don't you?   If this was the 'brand new' one, imagine what the 'used' ones looked like? I have had three orders of philosophical works that were all excellent. I simply need to share with fellow movie collectors that this was the single worst looking fifty dollar 'brand new' disc that I have ever seen. Three players would not play this movie, I would stick to other items besides DVDs. In Amazon's defense, both mail order movie houses are notorious for sending other people's returns out as new movies. I dropped one of them for consistently mailing me unplayable, scratched beyond repair discs. I did take offense at the adjectives 'brand new' 'never been played,' this disc looked worse than movies I have owned for over a decade. Stick To Other Items. Take Care. Deus Vobiscum.

I do now that I have purchased counterfeit cosmetics and a Isaac Mizrahi bag. Back in March I purchased what I thought was an Isaac Mizrahi bag. I was saving it for the summer. I received it and thought it looked nice but didn't thoroughly examine it. When I finally looked at the bag...Isaac Mizrahi does not stamp his bag in cheap gold ink. The bag wasn't even leather. By the time it was uncovered...it was too late to get refunded. I also have bought counterfeit lipsticks. I did 2 things. I went to YouTube on how to spot the fakes and it all matched up. I had a family friend who is a manager at an Ulta cosmetics store confirm this too. I would not have suspected an inexpensive makeup brand like NYX to have counterfeits buy unfortunately they do. I was refunded but that's not the point. I was going to order an Anastasia Beverly Hills contour palette at $45 ...$5 more than they charge at Sephora. I read at least 5 reviews that said they received a counterfeit and one person uploaded a photo of the color swatches of the real vs the fake. They are charging $5 more for a counterfeit item.

But I think they have really gone down in quality over the last few years, especially on the shipping front, when buying direct from Amazon. They often will not even ship days before your estimated delivery time. You apparently now have to ""pay"" to get fast service from amazon in the form of prime.. whereas if you instead buy from any vendor on ebay and you get fast shipping for free.

I also feel the front desk should be friendly and welcoming, but this does not remove from the quality of the hotel. It probably means she doesn't like her job or is having a bad day. This person gave a poor rating on feeling not fact. Back to Amazon. Fact is, Amazon has always followed through with correcting the few problems I have encountered with vendors. One particular time Amazon did something which I could not believe. I was so pleased but felt they had gone way beyond the call to correct my complaint. This situation demonstrated to me, the professionalism and customer satisfaction Amazon is focused toward. I realize of the millions who order through Amazon, there will always be occasional negative issues to address and most are probably legitimate.

3074,"I buy via Amazon about 3 times a month...I find them very good to compare similar products of what you are looking for, and narrow down a buying decision. I stay away from items that have a high chance of needing to be returned, so I do my research first to avoid the return-process. I also try to stick to products that Amazon themselves ships, so I have more predictability on how long it will take. Up to now, have only returned one item out of many purchased...good track record for Amazon...return-process was smooth, but rather avoid it.. One of my few complaints about this site, is that many products are not displayed-photographed properly nor extensively, so often it's hard to see as much as I want to see; the whole idea of buying online is to be able to visualize what we are buying as best as possible, since we are not at a store actually seeing-feeling the product. Amazon could make the website more visually appealing and have their vendors improve the product representation in photos. Another minor issue, is that the first thing I want to see from a vendor, other than feedback, is where do they ship from?( When not shipped from Amazon)...Amazon gives you the info, but not to handy (you have to dig for it). Conclusion: I usually use Amazon for specific products that I've pre-decided I need and know something about (usually I check Ebay as well to compare)...I don't wander around just looking at products for shopping-fun, but rather chase specific product-needs I have determined (example: I need a spare camera battery for my Nikon: I go to Amazon first, and cross-check with Ebay prices. Eight out of 10 times I find Amazon offers better choices & service, and a simpler return-process if needed... Example of an Amazon typical purchase of mine: camera lens...Best Buy has it at store for significantly more than Amazon...Ebay has a similar price but a vendor with feedback I don't care for...Amazon has it at a competitive price, and shipped-handled by Amazon: I buy it from Amazon.

Back when you refused to chase after others, but preferred to ""innovate ahead"" of them. We all got so used to your prices being the lowest, back when you'd undercut everyone, even to the detriment of your own balance sheets. You were such a risk-taker. But you've long secured your place at the top of the e-commerce food chain, and your price points are creeping steadily upward as you continue to eat yourself. You're finding new ways to manipulate us into spending more in order to get free 2-day shipping. You've rolled out highly complex subscription programs that confuse and befuddle. You're trying to be Saks and Google and Apple and Netflix, etc. all at once. But you've never been that cool, nor will you be.  I'll never buy your fancy clothes, nor your failed smart phone (although if the price drops any further, I might pick one up as a toy for my 5-year-old nephew). But I will admit, with impunity, you're the first place I go when I know exactly what I need and I need it within 2 days. Sorry for using you for your cheap and fast shipping.

One of the items I purchased was lost in transit, this was told to me by the customer support gentleman I first spoke with.

After being placed on hold for 20 minutes while the finalized the 2nd order I am told that 1 day shipping is not available for this item, and amazon is able to offer me a 5$ gift certificate for the hassle. I was already a little bothered that after 8 days I had to call for Amazon to tell me the package was lost. To then be offered a quick fix and then be told its not possible, brought me to a point of anger. Amazon needs to train their customer support team to better handle situations and use better wording when speaking to guests. As someone who works directly with clients, one of the basic rules in customer care is to NEVER offer something you cannot guarantee and that is exactly what happened. The manager/supervisors solution was to extend my Prime membership an extra month. Besides this one incident, Amazon has been able to deliver items within 3 days of purchase including Sundays. It's a good company and has its benefits as an frequent online shopper. I would suggest the customer service department receive extra training.",3,amazon.com

If you have a problem, they work with you. Their customer service and return policy are superior.  Use caution when purchasing food products. Consider the time of year, the vendor's reviews, and customer reviews.

3144,Hello guys I found an awesome new place to buy games. :D They sell games for very cheap prices than in the market price and they will provide the keys instantly. I regularly buy games here.Check out the prices: bit.ly/1pOzBBI ;),3,amazon.com
3145,Amazon is extremely impressive at providing excellent customer service. Every time I have called their customer support they've gotten someone on the line within 2-3 minutes and they problem was always solved in one call. Returns are rarely an issue if ever and they have pretty much unbeatable pricing. Throw in Prime and there's almost never a need to shop at a brick and mortar store with the free two day shipping.But other than that Amazon are great,3,amazon.com
3146,Once after I stopped purchasing the products from eBay. I started to get those from this service. I normally get books from amazon. And they are usually about 75% cheaper than the new ones. I really like this service.,3,amazon.com
3147,"Huge product variety. Very good deals are possible. However, I have received some garbage products through Amazon. Probably my fault though. Just remember 2 things, ""You get what you pay for"" & ""If it seems too good to be true, it probably is""",3,amazon.com
3148,PROS: It is a legitimate multi-national business offering great quality goods and fast delivery. CON: Does not accept Paypal or Skrill (previously known as Moneybookers),3,amazon.com

3150,"Some clothing designs on amazon are good. I've taken a fancy on a piece of clothes and I make my quick decision to take it. I do really appreciate its workmanship. It suits me well and is pretty warm. The unpleasant thing is that its color is deeper than it looks on the website. When I see it packaged in a transparent bag, I think it is the bag that made it look deep. It is indeed in dark color when I put on the clothing.",3,amazon.com
3151,"I have bought a book from Amazon, which is known as a high grade reputation E-book website. It could be memorized as a nice shopping experience for I got the book here I've searched for a long time in an acceptable price. Excited at the arrival of the book, unfortunately its package was somehow damaged due to bad weather. Maybe I should have bought it in fine weather. Hope next time it would be good!",3,amazon.com
3152,Amazon is OK but overstock.com is much better though!,3,amazon.com
3153,"I used to buy some books from amazon, they all cheap and high quality. Then I try to order other things like mouse and keybords, it's not good as usual, there are something wrong with them. Customer service has really dropped the ball and have lost touch of what they are there for. I will nolonger recommend amazon or shop there due to the lack of respect that they have developed towards their customers. It seems like the bigger they get, the less they care.",3,amazon.com
3154,"I use the ""Subscribe & Save"" program monthly for various items. I like the program but you really have to keep an eye on your subscribe & save account, some items aren't available/can't get, etc. close to your shipping date. What I do now is start checking my acct. around the 20th of each month to make sure everything I've ordered is actually available. Other than that, it's a good program to save $$$",3,amazon.com

3157,good site,3,amazon.com
3158,"I really like Amazon but I purchased a tablet based on the reviews. Boy was that a mistake. I bought a 10"" Tablet and it was terrible. How could this be with so many great reviews? I went back and noticed that the reviews for 3 tablets were joined together. I could only find 2 reviews of 177 that were for the 10"", most were for the 7"" and a few for the 8"". So I started looking at other items only to find there were 100s of examples just like this one. That this is the way Amazon does it. SO DO NOT buy a product based on the reviews summary. You need to read every review to find the ones for the product you are considering.",3,amazon.com
3159,"when all goes well amazon is really good, but when their vendors don't hold up their end of the deal you can expect a wait of 2 months to try and receive some short of resolution for your bad service. some of the market place company's are shady to the point one asked me to change my review since at the end of the day I received my money back from amazon. I told them I refused that they should of offered better service so that Amazon would not have to work so hard to fix their mess-up and bad service. Also Amazon make you leave a email and calls you back. make sure u save the number they call you back on. you are going to need it . Lots of emails and phone calls later you, Amazon in good faith refunds your money. Just be prepared to wait.",3,amazon.com

3163,Customer service was horrible and I had to ask for a different Customer Service Rep. who I could understand. I felt as though my call was redirected to a third world country.,3,amazon.com
3164,"You can almost order anything now on Amazon, everything I have ordered was acceptable, in some cases I made it acceptable cause if you open it, it is yours unless it is returned in the original packaging...My only other hangup is with the shipping and the push to go with Prime on every order form that you go through. To their credit, the delivery is always really fast and you can have your own wish list and add and subtract to it which is always a good thing for me so I don't order 3 copies of the same book this month.... All in all, the shipping price is what holds me back the most. But its not a bad site at all.... M",3,amazon.com
3165,"I went to amazon last week as I would want to see review on some products I wanted to buy.. I just find it hard to find what I am looking for in the forum site...

3167,"Amazon may be a great place to buy as a prime member, but the message boards are really poor to discuss in. With the ""Do you think this post adds to the discussion"" feature makes it an useless system wherever you go. It is the only system for their forums, but some kids had to abuse it just to make a fool out of themselves. Most forums don't have that feature. Other than that, I was thinking of getting a fighting pad controller for the PS3. However, they ran out and it costs more than $35 to get it from... United Kingdom. Some prices of the products the other sellers handed out are more than their original prices. It's unbelievable to have Gears of War on the PC being sold secondhand for $33 on Amazon compared to $20 on Windows Games Live Marketplace. What's good for me is the prime membership. They may give me free shipping, but I'm still furious with the warehouse deals selling a game ""like new"" for $33. Seriously, Jeff Bezos sold me the Kindle Fire, then trying to sell people with the HD version and now he wants to compete against Apple for a Kindle smartphone? He makes me laugh to ever think of going against the big two of the computer industry. They don't have a lot apps, but I'm sure they're a waste. I'm giving it a 3/5. The prime membership may be strong, but the customer services mentioned by others along with the buyers/sellers community are weak. I suggest not go to the discussion boards.",3,amazon.com
3168,"It's a hit and miss. You can find almost anything, but when you start digging deeper, usually just a few models are available - not as many choices as on sites that specialize in a certain niche. Prices are good, but you can get better if you contact vendors that list their products on Amazon - just contact them directly through their own sites.",3,amazon.com
3169,"I order from amazon quit a lot. However, I have noticed several products do not have detailed descriptions or reviews. This makes it very hard to buy products. Also, if you have problems with a product that is not sold by amazon, amazon does not own up to any problems, malfunctions, or returns. This is something you do at your own risk, which I learned the hard way. I would say its okay to buy from, just make sure you do your research.",3,amazon.com

3176,"I have purchased from Amazon many times. If prime membership was a little less expensive it wold be more worth it to me considering I have two kids and purchase many items for them along with items for my home, spouse, self, etc. The website can be overwhelming at times but being able to drag items to a list bar to save for later is great and reminds me of items I had been viewing or searching prior. I really would love to be a prime member with all the added benefits for tv now and now that I'll probably be purchasing tablets for my kids now if might pay off in the end. I'll post again at a later date with more info and insight. So far Amazon is convenient and is capable of finding or atleast leading to something I'm looking for and even inspiring me to buy, create, or look into things I wouldn't have normally considered before.",4,amazon.com
3177,Quick delivery service.... This is so convenient for parents who hate going into stores such as myself,4,amazon.com

Delivery also sent my stuff to my neighbor and his stuff to me. Good thing we are buddies and we exchanged packages. Also noticed some stuff are cheaper (much cheaper!) at seller's own sites, even without free shipping and 5% back on Amazon card.

3190,"As a seller on Amazon I would say Amazon leads the pack with online scam! I get really good customer service and almost always win any A to Z claim because I was so mad about so many buyers seeking free items and their money back. I wrote to President Obama and file several Federal complaints. It is just aweful that the American people accept items and expect their money back as well. That is stealing! I always complained and let Jeff Bezos, CEO know I was an ethical seller and it was unethical the way Amazon just freely uses our money to give back to customer. Now I get really good customer service and if any customer complains, Amazon pays. That is not what a lot of sellers can say even sellers who make more than a half a million do not receive good customer care from Amazon. I will say the buyers are much more serious as well and will pay for expensive items more readily than any other e-commerce site I have ever sold on, in my humble opinion. I like to sell on Amazon better now than when we first started. I wish to see some other e commerce site come about and be a good competitor of Amazon because they are growing too fast and too powerful for their own good. If you see the reviews probably all buyer give so many five star reviews if it were sellers they would give it 2 stars.",4,amazon.com

3223,"To date I haven't had a problem returning an Amazon product within the return window and sometimes I've been giving extended time to do so. But to my surprise I've bought a few bad items based on FAKE 5 or 4 star reviews. Some of those reviews stick out easly due to them having the same typo error patterns. Example: ""love this.great product."" Or ""bought two.love it."" I have also noticed ""Bad"" reviews that were fake. They sometimes name another product they say is better. Some are being done by competiting companies and about 95% are not from Verified Buyers. Within the comment section under a bad review is where I first noticed a FAKE bad review. The sellers would be trying to resolve the issue and the customer seem to not want any type of resolution not even in returning the product. The seller claimed that the buyer was not a real buyer and that it was a fake review and all the customer had to do is return the product but they have no product to return. I'm sure the ones I've read like this we're fake.  My advise is to make sure the reviews are Verified reviews. I don't trust all of those either but this is a good place to start. Read and ask plenty of questions in the Q&A. Read through the good and bad reviews. Check comments to see if the seller responded to any of the bad reviews",4,amazon.com

I've been a member of Amazon since 2012 and have sent over 2,500 different .mobi, .pdf and.epub files to be stored in the Kindle cloud. Unfortunately, today I found out that Amazon/Kindle can't find much of the content I've sent/registered with them. Amazon insists all my content is still registered and available but can only find 357 different files. (This ""lost"" content is the reason Amazon.com doesn't get 5 stars from me.)",4,amazon.com
3245,"Shipping can be pricey, but orders are handled very efficiently - provided there are no requests attached. Amazon does not respond to special requests, like delayed shipping - you place the order, payment is approved, and the goods are on the way. Customer service can be time-consuming, as you do not deal with a single person, if you need to make multiple contacts. overall, a good organisation to deal with when you are up to play with the system.",4,amazon.com
3246,I live so far away from my grown children. I love ordering off of Amazon and having the packages sent to them direct. No mailing hassles on my part.,4,amazon.com
3247,"90% of the time, I am completely satisfied with Amazon. The most common issue I have is shipping, I've ordered things with free 2 day shipping that have always arrived when expected, but other things I've ordered with standard shipping, seem to sit in a warehouse somewhere until shipping time estimate arrives, causing late arrival more often than pleases me. I believe they do this to try to incentivise customers into joining Prime or paying higher rates for shipping priority. I've handled shipping and receiving duties during my career and sales that would have gone to Amazon lately, have gone elsewhere that handle S/H more the way I always did.  For a positive note, I only have received one order, in the several years I've been a customer, that didn't meet my expectations due to a missing part, but the cost of getting it on my own was less than the hassle of dealing with Amazon on the issue.",4,amazon.com
3248,I have ordered many things from Amazon. I have had two issues where I had to get a replacement item for defective electronics and when I notified them of the problem they had the supplier contact me via email and once I told the vendor(s) the problem they sent replacements no charge and I didnt even have to send the defective unit back. My only gripe is that they dont accept PayPal,4,amazon.com
3249,"Amazon, especially, Smile.amazon.com where my purchases support the Rotary Foundation is so easy to use. Prices can be a bit high, though. You must know what an item costs before you purchase, but selection and prompt delivery are amazing and Amazon Prime is great!",4,amazon.com

3255,"With Amazon prime, they ship the items to you in a day or two, and that is great. They also help with returns if there is a problem from the sellers. You do have to comparison shop as the prices on things fluctuate, and you can sometimes find items on other sites for cheaper. But as far as convenience, it is hard to beat Amazon.com.",4,amazon.com
3256,"I love the convenience of online shopping and Amazon Prime was always my go to shopping, but recently Prime has been quite unreliable. The average delivery is more like 3 days sometimes as many as 5. I had a refrigerator get ""lost"" after I got the email it was shipped. Took me two hours of customer support to get this one resolved as the specific model I needed was no longer in stock and I had already built the framing for it in my camper. It was eventually resolved amicably, but shopping shouldn't be this hard. Still plan on shopping with Amazon but dropped the Prime. Just isn't worth it to me anymore.",4,amazon.com

3262,"I had the wonderful opportunity to join Amazon this year. My husband and I wanted to change one of our viewing services to something different to get more of the variety we were hoping for. Im so happy we did. The shows and viewing options are awesome, but they are just the tip of the iceberg. Free 2 day shipping has saved us so many times when we needed something very fast. Weve discovered if you can wait just a few days more, usually Amazon will give you a small credit toward one category or another and they can add up and allow you to get some fun things. I keep hearing people describe the features Amazon had before I joined and I really feel like I missed out on some very fun options like being able to get a large variety free books to read every month. I love what Im seeing but I havent heard anything about new features that were comparable to what was taken away. Its unusual to see a company cut back on what they offer instead of adding to it or changing it to something comparable. Still, this is the Amazon I know, and although the removed features sound like they could make it even greater, I still enjoy what they do offer. I suppose ignorance is bliss as long as they hold off on removing features Im getting used to having with them.",4,amazon.com
3263,"good shop website,i have buy customized tshirt in this website and very satisfied it,Amazon used to be amazing. That is before the out of country and scammers got involved. I've had numerous orders not show up and told was delivered but when I checked the address wasn't mine.",4,amazon.com

I am not a Prime member, but I should really sign up, as they have great perks for shoppers. If the item I order is shipped by Amazon, it's pretty much guaranteed that the order will arrive within a few days. But if its offered by a sub contractor it may take a little longer. I have only had one bad experience with a shipment. I ordered an eye shadow palette that arrived broken. I snapped a pic and sent it to the seller and my Amazon account was credited that day. So I love Amazon!",4,amazon.com

3267,I've been with Amazon over 5 years and the shipping and handling is ridiculous...sure some of the things are cheap. ..but once the shipping and handling cost is added it's no longer a deal...I found a better site called jet.com...2 day delivery guaranteed ...and free shipping on 35 dollars and up...I've also found a lot more better deals,4,amazon.com

3269,"The return process is exceptional. All you have to do is locate the order on your account, hit return items and they send you a return label which you can just print off through your email. Then you stick it on there and ship it back no hassle. They also give you plenty of time to send your items back out. Instead of the normal 2-3 business days most places give you. You don't have to talk to a customer service rep at all and you don't have to send out emails and wait for a response. You also do not have to wait for your refund; as soon as you drop your return off at the ups or local post office and they scan it in, you get your full refund.  The customer service if you do decided to call is complicated and they mess up your orders hard core if you need something changed. I placed 2 orders and needed to cancel one so I called the phone line and asked them to cancel it. They cancelled the wrong one so I had to call back again and cancel everything because the rep was confused and didn't know what he was doing.Then It was a fight and alot of confusion about the refund for the orders. I guess it all worked out in the end but I didn't re order the purchase I had originally wanted to keep. Instead of cancelling an order it is easier to have it sen to you and do process a refund. It is much easier. They also have a lot of fake reviews on items but they are pretty easy to spot.  Other than that I use amazon for alot. Love it.",4,amazon.com

3340,Amazon is a good place i would say. Most of the time they do have better prices than other retailers and the prime service is valuable. Customer service is usually pretty good although if you have a problem and need to dispute an order it can take a ridiculous amount of time. This is more so if you order items that are not sold/shipped from Amazon directly. For me it took 4.5 MONTHS to get a refund for an item I didnt even order. However I've also had packages that did not arrive by the schedualed date and they gave me a full refund no questions asked. So like i said it's pretty good though it does have its annoyances.

I emailed customer service at Amazon asking if this was condoned and/or prevalent and what action they would take. Try emailing customer services at Amazon. You can simply cannot. There is a lengthy procedure but no options for general points like this So.. two things. Their reviews from 3rd parties may be highly biased and when you try to be ever so helpful by forwarding a copy of the 3rd party's email to Amazon, you cannot do so and have to resort to this.

3356,"It wasn't always that way but Amazon now sits on orders it could just as easily send off sooner...and it feels as if it's doing so, on purpose, to punish those who select free shipping. Nobody expects 2 day service but to wait until the last minute to release free shipments is poor form... If it weren't for this, Amazon would earn five stars from me...I buy lots of used CDs and books (third party sellers are almost ALWAYS faster shippers than Amazon) and the few returns I've had have been processed quickly. As good as it is, the shipping thing sticks in my craw...",4,amazon.com

3358,"I have used Amazon UK for several years and had no trouble. My goods have always arrived in very good condition well packed and within the dates specified. My only criticism is that many American companies do not trade with the UK and do not say so UP front - That tallies with my experience of Loud, brash Wealthy white trash Americans especially those from the South who visit where I live and are Far right, Racist and not MY allies,.",4,amazon.com

3376,"I have bought DVDs and books from Amazon for many years. Ordering and delivery updates impeccable. Never any uncertainty. And they could turn up sources for out-of-print books and rather obscure foreign-language DVDs. But lately I have run into dead-ends on some items, particularly on the number of outside suppliers from which to choose the best version of a title. They are often forgetting to mention if an English language DVD has subtitles (required to follow some plots and nerdy dialogues). It's just a bit harder to collect the vital statistics for a prospective purchase regarding publication data, abridgement, photos, translators. The things which make one edition of a book better than another. I could approach suppliers for the details but in the past I could usually get them from the Amazon descriptive entry or sometimes by looking at the book cover thumbnail.

3390,Great to be able to buy books in my native language at such low prices that allows me to forward them on to my current location.,4,amazon.com
3391,"I don't find the website that easy to use when you are looking for something specific and trying to figure out who to buy from. Ebay is much easier to know who the seller is and be able to check them out and communicate with them before buying. Amazon is mostly just find it and buy it - it takes a lot of tracking to ask about an item or check into the seller if you can even figure out who the seller is. I like to just buy directly from Amazon and I only buy products I am already familiar with so I know what to expect. Amazon return is easy but if you return for anything other than broken product, you will have to pay the return shipping so it isn't a place you want to try new products out like pet food or buy clothes you aren't sure the size of for that manufacturer unless you don't care about paying to return something. Unless you are prime which I wouldn't know about, shipping can take a long time for certain things. I've had to wait a few days even before my item shipped, as though Amazon was trying to order it to sell to me after I bought it, but they tell you right up front it will be a few days before it ships & then when it does ship, it gets to you fast. The prices are high. I find a lot of things cheaper elsewhere but if you only like to shop in the same place and don't have time to shop around for better prices - you can pretty much find what you want in Amazon as long as it is still manufactured and sold. Otherwise you have to rely on Ebay for hard to find or out of production items & hope someone is selling theirs or stocked up and has some to spare. The thing I use Amazon for the most is product reviews. Whether I am buying from Amazon or not , I never make a big purchase and sometimes don't make a small purchase without first seeing if their are any Amazon reviews. I figure some of them are fakes and self serving but trust the majority of them because you have to have an Amazon account to review & they also show the verified purchasers. Anyhow whether you like or not its a massive online force that isn't going anywhere.",4,amazon.com

3456,"Some of my best experiences have been with amazon.com!! I love the fact that as I established myself with this online business I started getting my return refunds to me the same day I shipped a return back!! Even when I first started returning items it would only take about a full budiness week before my refund showed up on my account which wasn't too bad either! I've gotten Great Deals On various things that have really made my life easier. I love the fact that I have access to bulk items on almost anything!! Now I've become addicted to comparison shopping in the stores like Wal-Mart, Whole Foods, Ulta, etc for my beauty supplies essential oils. I go on to amazon.com and see if I can get it for better price and oftentimes I can!! especially when it comes to hard-to-find items like essential oils,shipping boxes ,shipping supplies, certain discontinued fragrances/ perfumes, cosmetics , etc. these items are almost always cheaper on Amazon! I love that the return procedure is easy too. I can drop off my returns at my local Staples that has a UPS drop off on site. I love the fact that even though I refuse to pay for Prime which is $99 a year they still have thousands of items that offer free shipping with a minimum purchase so if there are several items I plan on buying and they all offer free shipping with a minimum I usually end up getting free shipping anyway so for me it's always great!! Sometimes I wait until I need a couple of things that allows me to meet the minimum and then I get free shipping without spending $99 a year which I'm sure pays for itself in the long run for consistent. but I'm one of those people that just never knows when I'm going to be shopping on Amazon! sometimes I shop every 3 months sometimes I find something i love every month and sometimes I can go 6 months without making a purchase !! especially if I buy a lot at one time I might only shop 3-4 times a year so on average paying $33 for free shipping kind of doesn't work out for me BUT if you're someone who constantly shops then the $99 is probably worth it!  the only criticism I have of Amazon is that I wish they would get rid of those overseas Chinese based businesses that sell clothing that are so far off the u.s. sizing that every other review i read is negative about buyes ending up having to return the item because it fit horribly or was made from super cheap material.  Often times the return cost was so much it paid to just keep the item !! which is very disappointing so I always have to check to see if the sizing is US or a Chinese conversion chart because that right away is a red flag for me! If they got rid of those sellers I think it help. They don't need subpar cheap items being sold through their site you can only hurt them in the long run bc I've heard plenty of people who were thinking they were getting this amazing bargain and great fashion ended up with this super cheap stuff plus arriving from overseas sometimes takes weeks!! and when the item finally arrives and it's two and three sizes too small. I've only bought one item that I knew was not from a us-based manufacturer. I decided to take a chance because I had been looking for this item and of course when I got it not only was it super small but it was defective because there was no button hole for the button!!!which was hilarious and proof positive to me that I need to stay away from those companies! but other than that great experience every time",4,amazon.com

3478,"So long as you realize what you are getting and make sure the seller is rated good (for me that's 99% or better), you will be happy with your order. If you think you are getting the greatest deal ever, then be ready to be disappointed. A large chunk of the stuff sold there is made in China or within that part of the world.

3483,"Amazon is a great place to get what you need at a great price. Their customer service is great. You can get products that you need at great prices and Amazon stands behind everything they sell. However, like eBay, Amazon is notorious for scalpers who buy products and then resale them for hundreds over MSRP due to shortage of these items. Apple products and Nintendo products come to mind... If you want something, be sure to purchase them from legitimate sellers. Don't fall for scalpers which Amazon should not allow. That is the reason I deduct a point from this review. Scalpers are the reason why we can't buy products at the MSRP prices... they buy up the supply dry and resale them for much higher prices. If Amazon and eBay don't allow these scalpers to do business on their sites, consumers would still have a chance to buy these at fair prices.",4,amazon.com
3484,"I use the Amazon app often and find it relatively simple to use - there are a few issues I have issues wirh.

3491,"I am a prime member of Amazon and have been for at least 3 years. Love it. Amazon leads the pack in online shopping, customer care and a super fast response to complaints. Their shipping is ""very good"" but used to be excellent. The reason for the change is they have switched a lot of shipping from UPS to USPS and this has slowed down deliveries by a day or two.",4,amazon.com

3493,I love shopping on Amazon as I live in a small town with limited overpriced stores. The shipping options are great.

3497,Amazon has just about everything you could want and they ship it fast. If you have Prime you get free 2 day shipping even on Sundays. What's cool is they will even do same day shipping for Prime Members if the order is over $35 and it's available in a local warehouse. The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is their price match policy is lacking compared to all other major retailers.,4,amazon.com
3498,"Really, very good service, but pricing could be more loyal, as for me. But good in sum! Nice support, good stuff and there are really rare books!",4,amazon.com

3500,"I have looked about for a place to review Amazon--especially Amazon Prime. This is the first place I could posit my reservations about it. I have prime because I have a ""long ish"" Roku relationship and Amazon is making a run at Netflix--I have both streaming services. But I got Prime in anticipation of a major repair on my house for which I was going to be buying tools and material. the rub is that not much was covered by Prime's free/fast shipping policies. To be fair, this was not the main thrust of Amazon's marketing but I urge users to be aware that Prime has holes in its coverage in the specifics of books, music, and merchandise that very well may be the main reason you want the service.",4,amazon.com
3501,Buys dog biscuits and they are pretty good on price and same quality as the shops. I've bought collars and other pet items as well.,4,amazon.com
3502,One of the most wide product ranging website of the world. The delivery service is very fast as compared to other online stores. The service is very reliable.,4,amazon.com
3503,Usually very good. But sometimes real expensive if you want something that is hard to find. They have asked for reviews even if they have not even shipped out the item. Kind of ridiculous.,4,amazon.com
3504,Like the prices most of the time. Easy to find things I need. Sometimes delivery time is too long. Which I'm not sure is their fault or not. They have everything and that's good enough for me,4,amazon.com

3508,"I have always been a frequent shopper on Amazon and a reviewer too. I love the products, the prices and the service. I would have definitely given it a 5 star rating but the only reason why I gave a 4 is my recent shopping experience with a book that has been out of stock since the past two weeks. I have been contacting Amazon to know how long will the book take to be back in stock- they replied twice and then said they can't help me further with the issue. My question is since Amazon has that book in its listing then it is Amazon's responsibility to bring t back in stock and secondly who else shall I contact to know about the book?  This is the first and hopefully the last time I came across such a situation otherwise I really like Amazon! Plus its super safe for your transactions!",4,amazon.com
3509,I got my ray ban glasses through amazon. It took a long time (more then 3 weeks) to get them however I saved a fair amount of money. I recommend to get sunglasses via amazon but be ready to wait.,4,amazon.com
3510,"I've been an Amazon Prime member for years, and up until recently I've been 100% satisfied with it. Recently, Amazon has started using something called ""Share Post"" for their shipments and it sucks. They ship UPS to the local Post Office and drop the shipments so the post office will be responsible for the remainder of the delivery. I guess it's cheaper, but I recently had 5 different shipments get lost in that process. For people who live on rural routes, you can't use the street address which is required by UPS; instead you have to list the PO box because the post office doesn't do home delivery in certain areas. It wouldn't be such a big deal if, during the ordering process, there was a disclaimer notifying the buyer which form of delivery was being used. That way the proper address (street or PO Box) could be listed and there wouldn't be this confusion.",4,amazon.com

3519,"I have made numerous purchases from retailers on Amazon with mostly quite positive experiences - products shipped/received on time and as advertised. My only criticism is minor - that is, when a problem is experienced, there is a very short character limit for the review, so that it is not possible to enter a detailed account of any problem with one of their retailers. Thankfully, I've had only one problem worth providing a negative review over the last several years of purchases.",4,amazon.com

3530,"Normally, seamless; worth looking at reviews. Prime is great but return shipping with other companies can be steep and those companies know it when they sell products; pictures can be deceiving. I got two MORE cans of PC Woody - expensive stuff. I thought I was getting the large ones, but got tiny ones; couldn't tell by picture. Also, when I called company to ask if I could just exchange and buy the bigger ones they said no. ""You have to pay the shipping."" Nasty. Bondo for wood is better anyhow. I had already purchased 4 large cans from those cheap idiots.",4,amazon.com

3557,"i'd been ordering from amazon (UK) constantly for years until last summer. since last summer most of my orders are being automatically canceled due to transaction delays. i don't know if it's only exclusively amazon's fault, it might also be my bank's fault. But it's really annoying that both have no idea why my payments are being declined.",4,amazon.com
3558,"Pros 1) Amazon Prime offers free 2-day shipping for many products. 2) Amazon Prime offers some free music and movies. 3) Amazon Prime offers free returns for some items and the return methods are hasslefree. Did you notice something? Yeah, Amazon rocks when you have Prime membership. However, the membership fee is high. Cons: 1) Sometimes 2-day shipping fails to deliver in two days. 2) Amazon Prime only offers very limited choices for free music and movies, considering the membership fee. 3) Amazon Prime does not cover free returns for all Prime eligible items. For instance, I needed an immune boost product when I was very sick, but the item was delivered on the third day. I couldn't wait and got something else. However, the item delivered was not eligible for free returns. 4) There are more and more products on Amazon that are sold and shipped by sellers in China. The quality of these items is very questionable most of the time, and the shipping time is ridiculously long. I'm not saying we shouldn't purchase anything from China, but that being said, at least it should have a filter function for buyers to choose. I purchased a fall dress for my daughter and it didn't tell me where the item will be shipped from nor give me a tracking number, so I waited for over a month (already lost track of time since it took too long -- maybe 5~6 weeks) to receive it. The weather was already winter-like around Thanksgiving, so I don't see the point of keeping the dress as my daughter will outgrow it very soon. Bummer!! 5) The search engine of Amazon fails to deliver only the results you want -- it somehow gives a lot of junks when crossing your key words, and I don't know why. On the contrary, I feel eBay does a better job on this. 6) Amazon should make itself more visible on Google shopping if its search engine has flaws. It is very frustrating to be not able to find the real products neither from Amazon nor Google shopping. Due to the reasons above, I'm giving 3 or 4 stars for Amazon.",4,amazon.com
3559,"Always a fan of Amazon, I think I primarily use it to keep a huge wishlist of books. When ordering, it's always swift and easy, and deliveries always arrive in good shape.",4,amazon.com
3560,"Absolutely love Amazon and all of the variety of products they have to offer, beware of one-click ordering without checking competitors pricing. At the same time I love their subscribe and save as the pricing usually beats any local competitor. Customer care through Amazon direct has been exceptional. I will no longer Buy chargers, cables or cases for any technology through any third-party seller due to the crazy amount of knock-offs and subpar items on amazon.com.",4,amazon.com
3561,"My only gripe with Amazon is raising the minimum purchase for free shipping to $45. Sometimes I just want a few things that are less than that, and I don't buy them at all because of the shipping costs. Amazon's loss... Then on the other side, the best thing ever was getting an amazon.com rewards credit card. I stopped paying cash as often, just to get more reward points, and they really add up. It is SO nice to order some things on Amazon, and then not have to pay anything at all! You cannot beat that with a stick, as they say. Ordering things online at Amazon, at usually the best or really close price, with free shipping, is really good for me, as I really do live out in the ""sticks"", and it is a bit of a drive to shop for anything. I must say at least 4 plus stars!",4,amazon.com

By my 2nd delivery I have 8 9f them. I called to ask how they retrieved them and I was told ""they would pick them up when they brought 2nd delivery"", but that delivery person said he didn't pick them up, someone else would. So I called, and with a heartfelt apology the customer service representative said she would have someone pick them up in 2 days. Lol A week later I called and I was told to just leave them out by the mailbox. Well, good riddens big Green containers. I'm not sure what company delivers the products but they will leave them, drop them over the fence and they never require a signature. I'll still shop on amazon.

I've had a few issues with their in-house delivery company, and a few with their outside sellers (I've bought and reordered compression socks that should all be the same size but aren't), but they've usually handled the problems expeditiously.  I do think that they boost the prices of their Prime merchandise to compensate for the 'free' shipping, and being Prime no longer seems to necessarily still mean 2-day shipping, but I decided to accept that.",4,amazon.com

3601,"I just signed up for a Prime membership after passing on it for a number of years and all I can say is I wish I had done it sooner. I would estimate that while shopping for something (anything) I will find it cheaper on Amazon.com about 90% of the time. Also the review system on there is extremely helpful when deciding on whether to buy something. The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because there seems to be alot of ""review in exchange for free item"" type reviews on there lately which I am always suspicious of and would like to see Amazon address. Other than that I love them :)",4,amazon.com

I am disappointed that some items wont be shipped to Australia that can be bought here at an obvious large profit for local sellers, and those that can when I see the shipping cost most times I decline to make a purchase. I have compared shipping costs and I believe to encourage aussie buyers shipping can be trimmed enormously to helps us over here buy.

3627,you can buy any product in online! Great collections and home were.,4,amazon.com
3628,I want you to thoroughly read my review before down voting it leaving a negative comment. No doubt Amazon is one of the finest online shopping stores. Flipkart and Amazon are two where most of the times I can blindly take their offers and buy their products. But sometimes you will come across the product details that are too good to be true. Especially when you are browsing through their Electronics section. For example Mobile Phones. You might see some cellphones with epic specification and at a very cheap price. Beware on Amazon many sellers tend to update wrong information(Not sure if they do it intentionally or they just copy paste information from some unreliable sources) I have seen it and I know sometimes if you don't do some research at your end you might end up getting a low-spec cellphone which was advertised with too many power components and features. Other than that Amazon is awesome. So be careful while you buy a cellphone and you must double check specification before you place your order to avoid disappointment.,4,amazon.com
3629,Helpfully cheap endless supplies,4,amazon.com
3630,its good,4,amazon.com
3631,"Amazon offers great online shopping, however the prices are often a little bit high on apparel. Great and trustworthy place to buy electronics from. Just make sure you read the reviews on the sellers and the reviews on the product as well as the details.",4,amazon.com
3632,I needed a printer cartridge and a couple of other stuff. I was able to order and get it delivered the same day -- without a HUGE surcharge for the convenience. Great!,4,amazon.com
3633,"I have 2 major problems with Amazon and those are: 1: I am an Amazon Prime member yet I pay 100$(basically) to be so while they do promotions for new people to join for half the rate. I believe Prime members should get a deal from that as well. We've been loyal to Amazon and it is unfair to charge newbies way less than we pay yearly. Maybe they could lower or give a small/whatever refund for those promotions to current Amazon Prime members. 2: Another Prime issue. I'm paying so much for Prime, but I can't watch my films in HD because they won't change their player. It's so annoying to watch shows in standard when you're paying for HD and I'm not going to switch to other browsers every time I want to watch a show that happens to be on Amazon. 3: (Not a MAJOR issue, but an issue none-the-less. Amazon seems to be very pricey and just to keep getting more and more so even for Prime members. Usually what's on Amazon, I can get MUCH cheaper on Ebay or some other site. 4: Please check the reviews people give for items and movies because some times they are NOT reviewing the item, but the seller. This totally ruins the review value. I can't trust the overall review because some idgit is saying ""they sent the box to me bent""....that has ZERO to do with the product at hand. Someone really needs to get on that one. Pluses and why it got a 4 star:  1: The free shipping is awesome. I love not having to deal with that.  2: The majority of the time their customer service is excellent...like the best. Only one time did I have to deal with a bad one and I just went to another one and they fixed my problem pronto. 3: It has a lot of Prime freebies that I love (but it could stand to make some more of it's movies and TV shows free for Prime Members). 4: It's pretty easy to navigate. 5: I bought a 6 cartridge litter box from members on the site two times and I was sent ONLY ONE two times....Amazon refunded me and let me keep the one that I did get instead of forcing me to go through the trouble of sending it back when it was a huge error on the side of the seller and the boxes are quite large. It would've been too much of a waste of my time. I paid over 70$ each time for 6 boxes.",4,amazon.com
3634,Still needs an option to review stuff if you havent bought anything yet.,4,amazon.com

3636,Awesome shopping experience,4,amazon.com
3637,the only reason I don't give this site 5 stars is because some of the items are a little pricey (expensive ) but they deliver pretty fast some times getting the package to you way before the delivery date,4,amazon.com

3659,"Amazon has near everything for better than retail price , they also have good fast shipping , I love this site!",4,amazon.com
3660,"I have Amazon Prime and it makes shopping on this website even better. I occasionally compare deals on Amazon and eBay, and retail stores to see which have better prices. Sometimes, Amazon isn't the most inexpensive, but if there's a situation that an item is, the Prime Shipping is extremely useful. The customer service is very helpful. It's overall a very friendly experience and extremely easy to use. There are some minor things I'd like to mention: 1. Pet Items: Maybe not just this category, but there are items that cannot be returned with no explanation. When I called up customer service, a CSR told me that some items ""just can't be returned"" even if the return policy never said anything about that. I asked him if there's a way to tell (for next time) and he tells me ""no"". Why? That's just strange and inconvenient. 2. Seller: If you think Amazon is more generous to you than eBay as a seller, they're not. They have their own policy to refund buyers for any reason just like eBay. Fees are not much less, although it depends on the category. Ebay is just a flat 15% (plus Paypal fees), so Amazon may win on the fee calculations. But, don't expect all buyers to be reasonable as I realize Amazon customers assume that there are no third-party sellers and are often impatient, demanding and hostile when there's an issue; even more hostile than eBay buyers. 3. There really should be a non-Add-On and a non-Amazon Fresh price. I wanted to purchase two different items that were only Add-On and Amazon Fresh. No other listing offers it even if it meant raising the price. Really disappointing; I wouldn't have mind to pay extra. 4. Two-Day Prime Shipping does NOT include the handling time, which can range anywhere between 1-5 days. I purchased an item that took 5 days to ""handle"" and then two days Prime shipping. Honestly, I could get amazing prices for certain items on Amazon, and best of all, some retail stores price-match if its shipped and sold by Amazon. I have used this website consistently every month for random purchases. There are really good prices and other times, maybe not so much. Its definitely worth having around.",4,amazon.com

3663,"I do probably 90% of my shopping on Amazon. It is always my first stop for anything I need. I love the prices. I like that part of my purchase goes to my favorite charity. I like not having to go to a store - or several - to get what I need. I like the fast delivery rates and the subscription services for things I need regularly. My ONLY complaints, which is why it's only 4 stars instead of 5, are (1) they seriously waste a LOT of supplies packing small items in large boxes and not combining orders to a single address and (2) over the past two years, the rate of errors, non-delivery, and defective items has increased dramatically. I realize that it is due to the volume but, given that, I think they need to re-visit their return and replacement policies because its become very hard to get replacements and/or refunds when something goes wrong for most of the things I buy.

I can't watch prime videos, movies because of my location and I always pay the yearly subscription fee which is quite hefty.

I like their ""prime"" service since it includes a large variety of things and their ""prime"" service means i will get what I want quickly. It sometimes is not as fast a promised, but those occasions are rare. Sometimes tracking a package takes a few extra steps because it starts with one carrier and ends up with the postal service in the end.

Amazon often cannot answe the questions. Some items i have bought have had a defect or design fault but despite reporting this they still contiue to sell them. Despite this i have always received a prompt refund if needed. Occasionally ive had problems with cost of postage which were supposedly free delivery. Amazon say this is to do with being a market place or amazon product or the totall has to be over a certain amout. This could be made s lot clearer.

It took me a while and also had to provide the law and they finally refunded the full amount.   For the most part I have had good luck, and not to many issues with needed to use refunds or replacement.  I have noticed of late the prices on some of the products are far more expensive than many brick and mortar stores, so check prices before you buy on Amazon.

3708,"i buy a lot of stuff from this site, but i find more often then not the shipping is the most irritating process. especially now that you have to buy $49 worth of stuff to get free shipping.  when you order something, i find when its free shipping, that it will often take an entire week before they get around to ordering it and sending it. i live near a hub, i should be able to get it all much faster. i'm certain they do this to make the prime look better, but i think that's over priced. unless i'm shipping bags of cement and tires, i don't think i'll ever get to a $100 in shipping.  another thing is the cart, while it will hold your items forever, if its out of stock, it kicks it out, i've almost forgotten to order important things because it did do that. and when it does do that, and you add it back to the cart, it may not be from the same company. it might be more money, or it may be used (as one item they sent me was). searching is becoming much harder, it finds things i never typed in. i would rather see - we could not find that exact item, here are some things related to it. but more times than not it will show totally random things. they use titles as keywords, and many people spam them. they allow reviews from anyone - even people who never bought it - always make sure it says - verified, or you may be seeing a fake review. they do have a great refund policy though, they have come through each time. but its tricky to find their contact some times. ---Mike Savad http://www.MikeSavad.com",4,amazon.com

Amazon has the best prices, and for prime members, often free shipping. The items arrive timely are well packaged. I can usually find used goods in very good conditions. It's better than driving 80 miles round trip to the nearest city and run to 3-4 stores only to find they don't have what I'm looking for in the price range I'm willing to spend. I do not like what I am reading about how they treat their employees. As a former employer I know that the bottom line is not the only measuring stick of a business. I won't shop at WalMart because of their unethical business practices. If Amazon continues down this path of employee exploitation I may have to look elsewhere to shop. We vote with our dollars and approval of unethical business practices should not be tolerated.",4,amazon.com

3737,I have been a prime member for 2 years now. Never have had any issues. Had returns that were worry free and taken care of. I enjoy the Prime music and video along with my purchases and I'd say 90% ends up free shipping. I do compare with brand websites to check pricing and don't usually find a price hike for the Amazin Prime...just once in awhile and take the better deal. The price is alittle higher again this year so I hope they don't keep raising it yet for now all my free shipping is still worth it!,4,amazon.com
3738,This site has everything you'd ever want. If you can't get it in your area you can get it here.

3751,"I've rarely had an issue with anything I bought on Amazon, and when I did, they resolved in really quickly. My only negatives are that not everything is available via Prime, and Amazon is definitely NOT always the most economical option...but you pay for the convenience of having things delivered to your door, I guess. My other issue is with selling books on Amazon. I've done this for several years with little problems, but recently, I listed a pair of books that were brand new, but had been at a bookstore for a long time and never sold. The ISBN showed the publishing date, and I stated the year of publication in the listing details. Both books dealt with professional photography, and the contents were still valid. The buyer got all bent out of shape about the fact that books were older (although they were brand spanking new) and complained to Amazon...who found in his favor. He got his money back, and was to return the books to me, but he never did that, and Amazon did nothing about it. Seems they're like eBay, and all about the buyers, but want to do nothing for sellers.",4,amazon.com

3758,The new returning service is brilliant! Which means I don't have to go pass the post office if I want to return what I've ordered. I just need to request a pick up and they will come around and collect it. Suits me as I work from home with children and it's not always convenient to drag little ones out.,4,amazon.com
3759,"When I need something I always check e-bay first, although Amazon has some good deals, e-bay prices are generally lower. Amazon runs a close second though.",4,amazon.com
3760,"I have found the reviews and the review system on Amazon to be a great help in understanding many products and services. If I take the time to read what regular people have to share, I usually always learn something new and useful. The problem with the internet is that it is a bottomless pit of raw info and has very little context and wisdom is hard to find.  Without wisdom, we are all shooting in the dark.  The availability of real user reviews and people's real opinions, as various as they are, is a small ray of light in a dark forest.  Since everyone sees things from a different perspective, it is often difficult to weed out the truth about something, but if you read enough comments, sometimes patterns start to emerge.  No other company offers as much depth in actual user comments, although this site, sitejabber, is a notable exception. People have wisdom and most people are decent.  If all companies allowed us the freedom to exchange our honest experiences, and the software would allow us to search a little better and also to collate the results, it would be a good day for consumers and a bad day for ruthless companies selling low quality trash.  So my Hat is off to Amazon. There is a reason most people use them and that is because they are the most reputable company out there.  If other companies followed their example, it would be a better world.",4,amazon.com
3761,okay Amazon.com have customer reviews and sometimes photos make sure you check them out before buying the product!!

3766,"Great place to get stuff you are unable to find any place else. Generally arrives fairly quickly, especially if you are a prime member. Twice, though, they said something was coming from over seas, and it turned out to come from the states. Which is good for me, because it didn't take as long to get to me as stated. Bad for the stores because I almost cancelled my orders seeing how long it was going to take. Great return policy. However, I do not like having to pay return shipping for UPS, especially since I can get it free to ship back. There should be that option of doing it yourself.",4,amazon.com

3832,"I am a U.S. citizen that is retired and living in Mexico. Amazon has a site here amazon.com.mx but it is really bad. The prices are sky-high as compared to the U.S. site and many things are listed as not available/out-of-stock. The thing is I have frequent family visits so I buy things on the U.S. site and have stuff brought down. Their international shipping rates aren't bad either if I need something ""now"" but quite a few things they won't ship to Mexico. The one thing that pisses me off is I have to use my family's credit cards as my credit cards are Mexican and are in pesos. Amazon gives very unfair exchange rates when they convert from U.S. dollars to Mexican pesos. Having said all that, they have everything, their prices are good, their Website is very well designed and easy to use, they are nice people in my experience and have excellent Support. I didn't rate them perfect because of the exchange rate issue, but they really are a good company to work with.",4,amazon.com
3833,"I've had an Amazon account since its early days, when they used to sell mostly books.

3841,"I've made a number of purchases on Amazon India and about 80% of my experiences have been very positive. Mostly the products are as promised and arrive quickly. In one or two cases they outer packaging of the items was peeling or dingy, but the products themselves were good. When I did receive damaged products or I didn't receive the products I had paid for, I contacted Amazon customer care and they immediately refunded my money. Only two points of improvement for Amazon India: 1) Many of the prices on your site are so obnoxiously, ridiculously high. I'm talking about pricing something that sells in the US for $10 (~600 rupees) at Rs.20,000. I waste time on your site because so many of the products I want are at these ""scammy"" prices. Ruins the whole shopping experience and makes me feel like I'm in some cheap fake marketplace full of scamsters look to swindle customers. 2) It is very hard to contact Amazon Customer Care. The first time I did it, it took me 30 minutes to figure out how to email/chat with customer care. There needs to be a prominant link for that.",4,amazon.com
3842,"There is this flaw in the instant pay system. If during the previous 60 days you accidentally included some item in your shopping cart, which you did not in fact purchase, the next time you purchase anything these items magically re-appear and if you are not very careful you will pay for them! They also take no responsibility for most 3rd party sellers which has become most of the business. The function which suggest other products based on previous purchases actually works and I find it more helpful than others.",4,amazon.com

3845,"I will only order through her if shipping and returns are free. I have order many things from through this site. Sometimes the quality is iffy. I have never had a problem with a return. They also have a department to monitors your account to make sure there is no fraudulent activity. Without my knowledge they actually caught someone using my payment account, shipping somewhere I never have and immediately disabled this payment account. When I discovered the activity the informed me what had happened, told me to contact creditor and that they would issue a credit when contacted. I did as told and everything was resolved without any problems. What more can your ask for.Great fraud department service.",4,amazon.com
3846,Amazon used to earn 5 stars I dropped it to 4 since I have had a few shipping issues because they now do some shipping with Ontrac.

The tracking of your orders is also really nice.,4,amazon.com
3847,"Amazon is amazing. I'm not surprised that they've grown like a weed. So far I haven't regretted any buys there, although I've probably paid a few bucks more than if I'd researched more. I'm glad they're trying to revolutionize delivery. UPS has repeatedly let me down as a consumer so they need more competition, not less. I don't write 5-star reviews. Good!",4,amazon.com

3850,"I have never made a better decision about something, I just had to come back and share. Before I bumped into Glestore Men's 3-pack Modal Soft Boxer. I was looking for something that could enable me to be free and yet give me assurance that I'm totally covered- you know, without having to remind me I'm carrying a package when I walk and this babie right here was designed just for that! I have to admit that the quality is at its best, the design that takes the body's nature, not to mention the price. They had all these different sizes and colours to choose from so i didn't have to try so hard to find something ideal. With a smart combination of 95% Modal and 5% spandex the absorption capacity is quite high, even higher than cotton fiber which is about 50%, i have done a couple of wears but so far not felt suffocated or soaked, even during my work-outs they have proven to be breathable, this definitely spells quality and for me to place my wallet on a product, there has to be some good quality in it. These underwear have been nothing short of comfortable, and quite soft which is a great feeling not having to be coursed by rough jeans, they are also slim fit and can be worn under any material. Though I'm kind of wondering what you had in mind for us with this product because it falls more on the sexy side which is a plus anyway, because either way you look good both with and without pants. They also cover a good section of the thigh and in them I don't even feel close to naked. It's almost like wearing a second skin but with a good fitting for your junk, meaning good chocolate with a good wrapper. The waist is another thing that really got points from me, it's firm but not too tight and the fitting's perfect especially around the groin. I have bought a few different brands before that I won't mention here for obvious reasons but some of them actually make you feel like you're wearing a female swimsuit--and sadly, I kid you not. I have seen far more expensive brands, this kind of explains why a lot of females have a notion on men scratching their 'groins' publicly, the itching comes as a result of wearing underwear that's too tight which would obviously bring that region too close to the body, which should not happen anywhere in the face of the universe-no really, it shouldn't. This also does not mean they should be let to hang free for reasons best known to us. All men irrespectable of their social standing, lifestyle, political power, age or.. or.. forget it, deserve good quality, well-fitting underwear and the Glestore Mens 3-pack modal Soft Boxer provided just that for me. In my experience-that is; since I started buying underwear on my own which is a long while, i have so far not found few that can compete with the comfort of your everyday wear of Glestore Mens 3-pack Modal Soft Boxer. At first I tried this brand out with a 1-pack but it obviously didn't take long to purchase the 3-pack. One thing that probably sucks about my life is that I actually don't have enough time for some of these little but time consuming chores so I was very glad it turned out to be machine washable, (can't do it most of the time) but presumably just a few machine washes and mostly hand washing we'll do, but that definitely worked for me. These days it's very rare to get anything good with an affordable price tag but your prices are like hitting the jackpot, the average cost of the Glestore Mens 3-pack Modal Soft Boxer ranges from about $6 to $9 on average. I found this price very fair to say the least and this partly gave me all the more reason to buy these superior undies. The return policy for some sizes is quite cool if for example someone bought a pair or more but the wearer was not present or aware during purchase, I guess they'd most certainly have to be unsealed at return but nevertheless I'm glad I went shopping around and discovered something different and unique. This product is the best bet you have in the male category and I will definitely be making future purchases if you keep both the quality and the price unbeatable. Hope my words can help you guys to find your style. Thank you.",4,amazon.com

3861,"It had always been so very easy to manage my Kindle Fire content, borrowing and purchasing e-books, audio-books, downloading apps., etc.., Until this past month when I got in touch with Amazon regarding deleting some e-books, audio-books, hypnosis & meditations that I had purchased recently and several years ago. My storage space is running low and since all of the above mentioned items had previously been read/listened to as a medical condition reduces the amount of time I can read. printed text. Unfortunately, every inquiry that was sent Amazon (about permanently deleting the books) has been sent to Audible who has no idea how to remove the content. My only option at this point would be to delete my Kindle Fire content completely and start from scratch -- that would entail my de-registering my Kindle Fire and re-purchasing the e-books, Audio-books, hypnosis and meditations that I still want and listen to. This has been an ongoing inquiry for well over a month and I'm getting absolutely nowhere, prior to Audible's involvement in this ""immersion reading"" nonsense, there was no problem at all with managing my content myself through Amazon's web site. The problem appears to be that the items being referred to were prior to Audible's involvement with Amazon books and they really do not know how to delete content. Guess they didn't think that far ahead -- did they -- Thanks2Net ??",4,amazon.com

3866,I have been an avid user of Amazon since 2005 and in these last ten years I have spent thousands of dollars and ordered tons of things. With Amazon Prime Amazon certainly makes you think about ordering from them more and more with the 2 day shipping which I love. They have also never gotten an order wrong of mine EVER. The reason they do not get 5 stars is because the Amazon Prime video service is still a little lacking in my opinion.,4,amazon.com
3867,Good,4,amazon.com
3868,"They have everything you need for anything. Only reason for 4 stars is because they have way too many different things to sign up for...audible, prime, Amazon books, etc and if you do a trial and forget to cancel they never notify you.

And voila - you end up with a book you don't need. I think I could make use of the return service but this was en e-book and it cost me 3 euros (only), so I decided I didn't need to bother.

With the exception of one product and another that failed to arrive (although the seller agreed to send another), I have been delighted with all of my purchases. The one issue I had with the company itself was probably my own fault, but is something anyone reading should be aware of. If you become a Prime member on the 3 day free trial (which I clicked on by accident), and then do not cancel this at the end of the complimentary period; you become a full member and are charged for the privilege.

From hardware to jewelry, I am very satisfied with Amazon.com.",4,amazon.com
3893,"Amazon isn't just a place to shop online, it is a resource. I used it research products, and I rely on the reviews of books, which represent individual and independent opinion. Yes, there are a lot of reviews that are just stupid, but if you read the critically, there is a lot to be learned. When I look at a book the first thing that I do is to look at the one-star reviews. If all the bad reviews are ideologically motivated, that is a reason to take the better reviews seriously. If the bad reviews are well thought-out, detailed, and carefully reasoned, then all the predictable rave reviews are probably mere fluff.",4,amazon.com

Incredibly fast delivery time, beating walmart.com by miles in this regard.  Wish that delivery costs from outside businesses to Prime customers were more lucid. Buyers must go back and forth adding and removing item from cart to compare shipping costs.  After buying two energy saving toilets on a tax-free weekend, sent email to Jeff Bezos about removing local sales tax from order. Received a reply that refund would be issued, though this never happened. This is a minor complaint, considering  great products are received without damage, quickly, and at a great price.",4,amazon.com

3899,"Amazon is a great way to shop for products. I have personally never had a problem shopping here. The only problem I had with an order was that it took a very long time to arrive. It apparently came from China. Anyways, as much as Amazon can be a great place to shop, KNOW YOUR PRICES.  Just because an item is being sold on Amazon does not mean it is a good deal. I have seen some products being sold for more than they could be purchased elsewhere. For example, I buy my health and wellness products direct from the manufacturer. People are selling the same products for 300% - 400% markup. That's REDICUOUS!  For example, I purchase a super high quality moisturizer for under $10. The product has been clinically proven to be 7 times better at holding moisture than Eucerin. The problem is that the product is being sold on Amazon for over $30???!?? Sure people are buying it for that price because the product is great, but I would rather keep my money by buying it direct from the manufacturer, thank you very much.",4,amazon.com

They were of decent construction, but two of them cracked after being dropped from about knee height. I sent them back to speck because they were supposed to be under warranty. Speck called me and told me to send them back to who i bought them from because they were fakes. Its funny, Amazon would not take them back. Their reasoning? They do not allow returns on counterfeit goods. I purchase many things from amazon. My experience with counterfeits has not soured my overall experience with Amazon. I just caution you to buy things that are easily counterfeit in person, or better yet, just buy them straight from the manufacturer.",4,amazon.com

My biggest beef is their ""temporarily out of stock"" description, which always means: ""permanently out of stock"". If you avoid these, you will most likely enjoy the cheapest prices and most reasonable shipping on the internet. If you do have a problem, their customer service department is grade A, and really do seek to satisfy their customers, which is why I buy from them so often. It also helps that shipping is free on orders over $35! They really can't be beat! (Shameless plug: check out my review of their ""Alchemy Mummified Palmistry Hand Gothic"". It's a truish story!)",4,amazon.com

The problem with their current policy is they are really cutting the price using sometimes very poor quality products from overseas. Now their return policy and return procedure is again; 2nd to none. Click a couple of buttons, take a printed return form to UPS and ship it with a credit already posted back to your account. Amazon could return to greatness by doing more quality control and allowing reviews that were not only about the product but also about the company. Good luck and God bless.",4,amazon.com

I bought a few things from Amazon online and I have never had a bad experience with them. I still have a few purchases from them that are still in use, quality products. I absolutely love their website, there are so much for the eyes to see. It compels you to buy even when you are just browsing. My friend regularly buys from them and she has never had a complaint other than buying the wrong sizes, that's her fault really. I don't mind when she does though because I end up getting the products. What I love about Amazon too is that they are an online electronic department store where you can shop for computers, apparel, computers, books, DVD's and more. Not only that you can also make money on Amazon by selling your services, sell your apps, become an affiliate, advertise your products, you can self-publish with them, You can actually make money on Amazon. The different ways I mentioned and more. Isn't that awesome. Another plus is that there are different ways of making payment for purchases with their payment products: Awards Visa card, store card, corporate credit line, you can also shop with points, they have their credit card marketplace and they also have currency converter. They cater to the needs of everyone. Amazon provides products and services, services in the form of employment not only for those they employ in their immediate circle but for everyone else who take advantage of the services they offer.

Most of the time I'm, not in the market, for the business that they are keeping me informed about. Result: An unending slew of unsolicited e mails about businesses in my area that I am mostly, not in the market for, when I receive their e mail. If they could stay in touch with you quarterly, send a brief questionnaire about what you might be looking for, in the next few months, travel, tires, electronics. The constant receipt of e mails ruins the experience. Lighten up Amazon, I know you're there and a lot of local business are affiliated. I'll let you know when I need them, or give me a chance to let you know what I'm looking for, just don't bomb me with ads about local merchants. It ruins the experience.",4,amazon.com

Not everything is cheaper on Amazon or worth getting by delivery. Make sure you really want the item or it's worth paying to return if you hate it. Having Amazon Prime is totally worth the membership if you make regular purchases and watch a lot of online shows/movies. Finally, Amazon Prime gives you free shipping but NOT free returns.

Other than that shipping is fast, and reliable. You can find anything which saves on time and gasoline. I will continue to shop there until another company can do better.

3984,"I love Amazon and, since I live in a rural area, use them a lot. 98% of the time they work flawlessly. 1.5% of the time they goof but the returns process works out fine. But that last little bit is when there's a minor gaff which can be fixed easily but that fix is not in their playbook. And there's no way to get a message to a customer service person. Example is a while ago I bought an item which was battery operated (included!) and fairly large. It was also packaged in one of those terrible blown plastic things but nobody noticed that the included batteries, easily visible in the online photos and indeed through the plastic, had been pilfered. The main product was ok but I knew they would send replacement batteries if I could just let them know. But no way to communicate that. So I swallowed the cost of a couple of batteries. I know, not a big deal but what if it had been some larger problem but just as simple to fix?",4,amazon.com

4000,"Amazon usually does things right the first time. However recently my husband ordered a grooming arm for my dog grooming table which was supposed to come with a clamp. The clamp was missing. I didn't pay attention because I have a shorter arm that has the same clamp, so I just used that. When I realized my new dog is going to need both arms for grooming I asked him to order me a clamp and he said ""didn't the new one come with a clamp? It was supposed to!"" So sure enough, it was, and we had to file a request for a replacement. The thing is, all the seller would have had to do is send us the clamp. But instead the Amazon return/exchange process wasted money by sending us a whole new one and shipping the one with missing parts back. Why? If this is how Amazon is doing things it is totally wasting people's money. Sure it didn't cost me and didn't inconvenience me except that they showed up to pick up the one I already had, two days before the replacement came, and we said no, you have to bring us the replacement first!  But the cost for all this extra freight from such an odd process goes into the system and applies to prices across the board. Just send me the parts I need from one you already have, and defect THAT one of yours out. There has to be a way to eliminate waste there.",4,amazon.com

Some of the prices aren't what they used to be, and shipping has gotten stupid expensive, if you want a package faster, than normal bulk delivery.

4014,"Update: I have changed my rating to 4 stars. Over the past (almost 4) years, I have seen Amazon go downhill. Shipping and returns remain excellent in most cases. Merchandise: has become more questionable and prices have skyrocketed. (Lookout for Outlet items in particular. Many are found on wish.com. Check it out). Clothing is super hard to pin down for quality unless you search for a particular brand. Off-brands permeate the site (when using just search parameters) with skewed sizes and questionable quality. Prices: I've seen stuff at DOUBLE the price of other online retailers (take a look at sparkling water for one). I don't use Prime anymore. It's not worth it to me. I've been a Prime member for years. I love it. I order anything from toothpaste to televisions. I only order Prime unless it's a special item. No shipping pays for itself within in the first few shipments. I furnished my entire apartment using Amazon. Very few times (out of literally hundreds) have been disappointing. My only caution: Like any other store, online or otherwise, be careful of ignoring regular or higher prices lurking among all item types. Check Walmart.com for prices on items just to be sure the free Prime shipping is not costing your more in item price. Also, love the Amazon Prime streaming video for movies and TV series. Walmart is supposed to add a similar shipping program on a pilot-program basis. We'll see.",4,amazon.com

4027,"We are continually impressed with Amazon's ability to provide stellar customer service and their Prime systems are a great value to all of us that shop online on a regular basis. We always go to the Amazon site first to see what they charge to gauge deals others are offering. We've seen people trying to sell used stuff on Craigslist for more than buying a new one would cost on Amazon! Even if you don't shop at Amazon, just them being there with their low prices, great customer service and Prime shipping, has forced other online and brick and mortar retailers to lower their prices or up their act, so kudos to them for that, if nothing else! All this having been said, they have one nagging and frustrating unacceptable issue. If you place a lot of orders they start combining them and shipping them separately and then charges with mystery dollar amounts start showing on your charge card statement that don't show up in your order history. So, then you have to call them and they explain that these two orders were combined or we did this and that and we're sorry they don't show up in your order history as they do on your credit card statement. This needs fixing! Just give me every order you charged to my credit card in my order history AS YOU CHARGED THEM so I can easily scroll through and check them off when my credit card bill arrives.

4030,"Have been very pleased with Amazon as both a buyer and a seller. As a buyer they get what you ordered at the price that was advertised. Shipping is no hassle. One issue that I have run into is when an item is no longer made by a manufacturer. Amazon sometimes will advertise the replacement item using the product description for the old product. If you want the replacement product fine. But, if the replacement product is inferior to the original you will have a problem. Sellers run into the same problem. They aren't given the means to advertise the new product. They have to advertise the replacement item using the old item description.  As a seller they hold you to selling a quality product and making sure you get it shipped on time. You must also provide a way for the customer to track their order. The complaints I have with them as a seller is that it can be a nightmare to get all of your information on the correct screens. The screens aren't the most user-friendly. And if you don't get all of your information down you won't be paid in a timely manner.",4,amazon.com

I like the fact that when I get to the point of having more money than I can spend that I can get Amazon Prime or pay for super fast delivery options. What is a little unsettling is when you don't pay the extra to get it tomorrow the order sits for a couple of days then it gets placed and I receive it the next day after that.

The shipping isn't bad - you have to expect to pay for deliveries - but occasionally I got free shipping. Once you order whatever, you immediately get an E-mail verifying what you've ordered, and periodically another E-mail advising when the item will be (approximately) delivered. They have some items that are overpriced - and I choose carefully in those cases - but overall I like shopping at Amazon. Especially when I want something specific & I don't want to drive all over to find it. I recommend shopping with them; and paying for the item thru Paypal.

The one thing I really don't like though, is that if you have Prime - as we did for while_ the shipping cost is actually built into the price of the item, making it harder to know if you got a good deal on said item or not. We ascertained this by doing internet searches on the same item using several sellers - ebay, Froogle, overstock, etc. and comparing them to Prime items on Amazon. I was surprised at what I found - that shipping seemed to be included in the price on Amazon.

Most of the time, everything I order is of good quality, even the used and/or refurbished items. Shipping is usually pretty quick too, regardless of what seller you pick. I always check the ratings (of both sellers and items) before I make a buying decision. I recommend Amazon.com to anyone :)",4,amazon.com

4112,Good so far,4,amazon.com
4113,"First let me start by saying, I LOVE LOVE LOVE amazon. Always have had excellent customer service and the products are almost always what you pay for. The only issue I have is with the merchants that seem to take their sweet time shipping things that are not Prime items. I've waited up to a week for an item to even ship, and I personally find that ridiculous. I always try to buy items with the ""prime"" logo, that way I know exactly when my items are coming. Overall though, thrilled with this site",4,amazon.com
4114,Excellent,4,amazon.com
4115,Love it! Bojan,4,amazon.com
4116,Even though it should be noted that working conditions in their warehouses are primitive and violate half a dozen regulations.,4,amazon.com
4117,"I rarely have an issue in ordering from Amazon and hold a Prime membership and love it. Recently I ordered a bag of dog food and paid $10 extra for overnight shipping because I needed it ASAP. After waiting two days with no food delivered and no update to the shipping I wrote an email to customer service asking for assistance. They replied quickly with an email that was not a canned response. The agent investigate with the shipper and found out the delay, refunded the extra shipping cost and then followed up the next day to make certain the food arrived. It was the perfect response in that situation and showed a willingness to go above and beyond to please a customer.",4,amazon.com
4118,"I always have a great experience with Amazon and I am very happy with the product that I receive. The only thing that gets frustrating is when I have to deal with customer service on the phone. They never seem to care to understand what the issue is. I think one time I had someone who was nice and seemed like they liked their job. But apart from the customer service, Amazon is great!",4,amazon.com
4119,I love to use this site for pre orders or general shopping. Only issue I have with Amazon is the price changes - do your research or you could pay more for an item!,4,amazon.com

4126,"I have been an Amazon customer for a few years & really like the variety of merchandise. The new Smile feature is an added bonus. Be sure to order from Amazon rather than 3rd party to get the free shipping on over $50! Many items are available directly from them, you just have to read carefully. Only item not satisfactory is the 9 hour VHS tapes - don't know if it's my VCR or the tapes are old, but I'm switching to a digital security camera soon anyway.",4,amazon.com

4128,"I place orders with Amazon weekly. They are fast, reliable and have almost anything you can think of. I like the price comparisons and the prime shipping is a great value. I have only needed to contact customer service on two orders out of 100. On both occasions they were disappointing. The phone number is hard to find, and they try to get you to use the web. I had a gift card that was delivered to the wrong person. It took me three phone calls to resolve it because the representative didn't take the action the promised. Customer service is shockingly bad given the great service Amazon otherwise delivers.",4,amazon.com

I mean once my return shipping label was scanned I got the credit back on my card within 24 hours way before Amazon got it and inspected it. Now that is customer loyalty. I just wish they had a better pay schedule for sellers and I would drop ebay, Poshmark, Vinted and Etsy like a hot potato. I would love to sell in just one place but can not afford to wait 3 weeks to get paid. My average wait on these other sites is only 7 days. Please get a better seller arrangement so I can come over to you and only you.",4,amazon.com

I did get a replacement of the item and it was of poor quality.It was a stuffed animal and it came so out of shape it did not stand up as it should (I did not bother to complain about it). I have written many reviews and only one time was refused to have it published (the complaint was about packaging). I have had packaging problems before and have been allowed to mention them in my reviews, so do not know what the problem was with that particular merchant. By packaging I mean it was not sent in a box or ""safe"" packaging. I have not received anything broken, but it is a wonder that I haven't.

4183,Since they started asking for $35.00 or more for free shipping I have backed off from shopping through them. I get tired of looking for something to run my total up to get free shipping. Sometimes I find the same thing cheaper on ebay AND GET FREE SHIPPING for item around $20.00.,4,amazon.com
4184,Great!,4,amazon.com
4185,Customer service is great to work with...they resolve your problems immediately. Selling on the site has become far too hard and one negative review can boot you out of being able to sell anything at all. I recommend eBay for selling and just use amazon for buying great stuff!,4,amazon.com

That's superior customer service. A storm had damaged his nursery before my order was filled and he, with my permission, subsituted 4 of the 5 purchased plants. It's a new plant for me, but the plants are doing well and I am very impressed with this nursery. Honorable and honest. The nursey name is Maranatha Nursery & Landscape 903-857-2300 in Winnsboro Texas.",4,amazon.com

4200,"My rating for Amazon is actually 4.5 stars only because you are fined the shipping cost if Amazon cannot replace the item and you have to return it. Otherwise, Amazon has great service. WHen something did not work, I got a replacement within one week. Recently, Amazon's prices have changed very fast. In two cases, the prices went up as I was still shopping so that my 15% savings for Subscribe and Save still ended up being a 5% savings despite the fact that I did subscribe 5 items. So be careful about the subscribe and save aspect because it felt a little it like bait and switch to me. For convenience however, it was still worth buying.",4,amazon.com
4201,"Amazon.com is a great site to shop and when you do (especially if you do it often), get the Prime membership. The annual price is about $70.00, however that is totally worth it - you get a free and fast (1-2 days) shipping on most of the items sold. Why not 5 stars?.. My stuff has been lost in the mail on several occasions and I think once or twice Amazon customer care completely disregarded my early cancellation requests (that was before the items were shipped). Can't let THAT one go! lol",4,amazon.com
4202,"I have purchased from Amazon multiple times. I have always had a good experience as I have received the product that I ordered.  It often takes a week or two to arrive, but it's always been in good condition and as described. I mostly purchase books for homeschooling as well as hard to find books.  In my opinion, this is a great resource for the homeschooling family as curriculum can be purchased at a fraction of the price while still receiving good quality materials.  I have created an account to sell on Amazon, but have never used it. Mainly because I do not find it user friendly for the seller. I prefer to sell my used curriculum on Ebay.",4,amazon.com

In one case, I bought an additional item to get the next day delivery because I had an immediate need for an item at work. It took 9 days to arrive.

Unsure if the warranty will be valid, but here's hoping that it holds up :D",4,amazon.com
4270,"I love Amazon. I think it's better than eBay most of the time. With Amazon I can get all kinds of great CDs, DVDs and video games for really low prices. What I like better about this than eBay, is with eBay you have to compete for everything and the infamous eBay Snipers almost always win. Plus eBay sellers are allowed to add little stipulations to auctions that contractually force the would-be-buyer to agree to in order to make a purchase. With Amazon, none of that is a problem because they don't let it work that way. The ONLY things I have to say negative about Amazon is that the sellers can't combine shipping prices which means if you buy 2 or more CDs from a seller, and they only have to spend $3 to ship them, you still have to pay $2.98 for shipping, for each CD. So the shipping on Amazon can you from a cart sub-total value of $5 and you end up with a $30 total. I also with sellers had to leave feedback for buyers as well. But with the way Amazon buying works it really doesn't matter. That's my ONLY gripe with Amazon. Other than that 1 thing they kill eBay in every single category you can think of. I talk to Amazon reps via-chat anytime I need an answer. Good luck contacting eBay reps!!! Amazon I give 4 / 5 only because the shipping will bite you in the butt!!!",4,amazon.com

4275,great site for great deals.,4,amazon.com
4276,"One can purchase almost anything at Amazon.com. Shipping, however, is haphazard. If the item that is ordered is actually provided by Amazon, the shipping is pretty fast. If it is through another vendor, shipping may take a month. Always be aware of the actual vendor of the item ordered.",4,amazon.com
4277,"If you don't know about this site where have you been? Amazon.com. Only two things you need to know. 1. Read full description of product before you buy. 2. Buy with confidence (it's so much a hassle to cancel an order. Almost non-existent) I've tried to cancel a couple of orders, but they usually don't reply till after you've been charged and item has shipped. Then you have the option of paying extra S&H just to return the item.",4,amazon.com

4280,"I have shopped at Amazon for quite a while now I also buy different things from there. To pc games, textbooks, I have even bought blank dvds!! As with anything online you should read the reviews really good and listen to that inside voice. I would recommened Amazon to anyone for anything.",4,amazon.com
4281,I love amazon! I've probably bought more than 50 products so far! Everything is great about this company.,4,amazon.com
4282,"I really do adore amazon.com I have not had a problem with the US based site (slightly different experience with the UK site) and cant say enough about how efficient they are.  It is sometimes slow to get things out but I have rarely had this problem. Great job, keep it up.",4,amazon.com
4283,I've used this site for well over 50 purchases and they are very good at protecting their reputation and provide good customer service. They hold 3rd party vendors who sell products on Amazon accountable which gives customers a great deal more leverage when it comes to returns. I've returned a few things and it has been pretty painless whereas most companies give you the run around trying to discourage you getting a refund. I would give them a 5 but I don't like the fact that they can't be contacted by phone and their online communication is pretty form based and impersonal.,4,amazon.com
4284,I saw a few bad reviews and read what they where mostly having trouble with and just wanted to clear things up for the site. One big thing you need to look at is who you are ordering to product from. yes you are on Amazon but websites/manufacturers post there products on the site and you are really buying from them not always Amazon. So when your product comes late or you where over charged Amazon is not at fault. When you go to order something it will say where you are ordering the product from. If you have had a bad experiences with a product than you know not to order from that manufacturer again. If you don't pay attention to the site you order it from its your fault not Amazon. I'v only had a problem with one product. I ordered a product and never received it after two months i went to amazon and wrote a bad review on the product and the manufacturer of the product called me two days later asking me to take down the bad review and they would mail me the product. So i took down the products review and they took down my address again and once again i never received the product. but oh well. Amazon had nothing to do with the product they pretty much just helped me find it. iv had no other bad experiences with anything i'v ordered and i order all my friends and family's birthday and x-mas gifts from there. Thanks Amazon!,4,amazon.com
4285,"I think it is a very good idea to always keep an account with amazon. However, I would recommend to check other online sites before you place an order at amazon. com- Many times I have found out that amazon sells it more expensive (include shipping charges).",4,amazon.com
4286,"Amazon is a website that allows individuals from all over to purchase a variety of items that may or may not be out of 'reach'. Due to distances, amazon enables people to purchase almost anything as they will ship it right out to you. They have provided people with a service by bringing the products right into their homes and personal spaces, something other competitors cannot do without bringing the customer to them.  Amazon is VERY effective because it cares of customers. They ensure delivery, provide promotions, and offer a variety of products for purchasing. While the website may seem intimating at first, if you know what you're looking for, its not a problem at all! The website's cons would probably be the unorganized, 'messy' look once the website is first entered, but soon the pros take over and offer people a look into what appeals to them. No longer does distance matter, amazon takes care of it. While I may not shop at Amazon a lot, I would definitely recommend it to a friend.",4,amazon.com
4287,"As movie stores, such as Blockbusters and Movie Galleries, are becoming slim to none in existence, many people have resorted to online options to watch movies. Many people prefer the online option to view their movies because it is often times free or cheaper than renting one at a store. Also having to be home or near a tv at the exact time your favorite tv series airs its newest episode is no longer an issue with these web 2.0 tools since they have both movies and tv episodes for their users. This instant availability has definitely been a major pro for users and is probably one of the main reasons movie stores are going out of business. I found three web 2.0 sites that people can use to watch their favorite tv shows and movies. I took into account the websites' affordability, accessibility, reliability, and more to create my reviews. Amazon's instant videos are very easy to navigate. There is a search bar and also categories to make it easier for the user to find what they are looking for. Another pro is that the prices for each movie or tv episode is clearly displayed. Amazon Prime is an option the site offers in which you can become a Prime member for $79 a year which allows you to have access to thousands of free movies and episodes that are have no additional fee as compared to having to make a purchase each time you decide to use Amazon instant videos. A major con is that there are no free options to this site and that there must be some kind of purchase made before watching an episode or movie. However the cost is relatively cheap and affordable. I would recommend this website.",4,amazon.com

Every other order I've had from Amazon has been correct and timely.",4,amazon.com

4293,"Always the go-to place when shopping. A few small issues remain such as sorting by price which basically doesn't work, and also searches tend to bring up many not so relevant results. They also collect sales tax in New York. My note about sales tax follows: Amazon COLLECTS sales tax; they do not CHARGE sales tax. Even if Amazon would not collect it, you would still be obligated by law to pay. It's just that no one actually does and so the states are going after the sellers to collect. Most states will have a section on the tax return where the taxpayer is supposed to indicate the amount of goods purchased for which no sales tax was paid - and then pay the tax. The issue is that if a seller does not have nexus in a certain state, they can basically tell the state to shove off since the state has no jurisdiction over them. The state would then have the option of banning the company from doing business there but then would run the risk of having the Interstate Commerce Commission come afer them, not to mention violating Federal and possibly even Constitutional laws. It basically comes down to a game of chicken between the states and the companies where the state tries to show that the company has nexus there and the company tries to show that it doesn't. Amazon is the biggest target due to its size and potential tax revenue to the states. They gave in to New York and is slowly caving in to other states. This will go on until the Federal Government gets involved and Congress passes some type of law governing the collection of sales tax. Or a case may make it to the Supreme Court with the same effect.",4,amazon.com

4300,It is a user friendly website and has wide range of products. I use it mostly for purchasing my books.,4,amazon.com
4301,I have had good luck with most of my orders from Amazon.com. The only reason I give them a 4 star and not 5 is because they use USPS and it's much slower delivery than UPS or Fed Ex. I've ordered some gaming devices and dvds only.,4,amazon.com
4302,Purchased a few things on Amazon - prices were 'okay' meaning they weren't the cheapest but they weren't the most expensive either - what I did like though was the ease of the purchase and that the products arrived exactly within the time slots they provided. I also like their review section under each product as I find it helps me to decide if i'm sitting on the fence about a product. Will use them again.,4,amazon.com

4306,"The number of products is incredible. Amazon Prime is a weird thing -- it makes you shop on Amazon more often, and I think they jack the prices up a little bit or at least have some minimum or something, but it sure is great to not worry about shipping fees anymore. What would make Amazon great is if they had some way to search for products like Newegg does. Amazon's product descriptions are absolutely horrible. You get little more than the model number. I always have to go search for the specs on other sites. It's really pathetic. I would use Amazon for everything if they fixed this, otherwise I'll pay Newegg the extra money to be able to find what I'm looking for.",4,amazon.com

I bought a video game for my husband for Christmas, but he already had it, so I returned the game UNOPENED and with correct postage but only received a refund for half of what I had paid for the game! When I called to find out why I was told they charged me a restocking fee. So I will continue to shop here, but only for things I absolutely know I would never need to return!",4,amazon.com
4309,"I think Amazon.com is a unique and nifty way to shop. Although I don't buy a lot on Amazon.com for myself, I find it a great way to find gifts, or things that are hard to find in stores. I first started using the Amazon.com as a way to find used books (I would try to buy as new as possible, if you choose to go this route). I then found it as a great way to buy gifts for my boyfriend, since they have a wide range of camping supplies. When it started to get more well known, my aunt began getting us gift certificates to Amazon.com for Christmas. Although it's hard to find updated clothing, I still find lots of cute shoes, electronics, books, and camping gear for myself. They also have pretty quick delivery. I would just be sure to research the item, where it is comming from, and check all reviews before purchasing.",4,amazon.com

4313,Amazon themselves are excellent. The only problems come when you are ordering from someone on Amazon that are NOT Amazon. Often in these cases the shipping can be more than the cost of the product and a lot of he Amazon benefits are lost. I only order from Amazon myself and am pleased with them.,4,amazon.com
4314,"Amazon is a great place to find some bargains and hard to find items but be careful when ordering from some of the retailers that compete with Amazon on prices (on Amazon's site). Also, if you want to sell something on Amazon be prepared to get royally screwed over! They take a HUGE portion in commission for themselves without doing a thing! I prefer to sell things on Craigslist and not get ripped off.",4,amazon.com
4315,"As everyone already knows, very reliable website with excellent variety of goods. Excellent return policy - I purchased the wrong InvisiShield and was able to return it with no questions asked even if the package was already opened! Also, amazon is even better with the PRIME (esp the 2 day shipping for free) service offered to college students for a year free!!",4,amazon.com
4316,"I love Amazon.com. I have been buying from them for the past 10 years and have not have much problems. Sure, once in a blue moon I get a wrong item, but I think it was only like twice in 10 years, still a very good record! I love that they have a lot of variety and other buyers to buy it from. From books to lotion, almost anything you can think of. But the best part for me is that if I ever want a good product review, I can just go on Amazon, search if they have it, and then read the reviews of other users. It has saved me many times from making the wrong decision!  Buying from the individual sellers can be more tricky, not all of them ship as fast and you don't get the free shipping plus they make more mistakes in shipments than Amazon do. It is especially a problem when you are ordering multiples of the same item. Sometimes the sellers charge you the shipping fee per item. Meaning $4.99 per hand lotion, but if you buy 2 bottles, they will charge you $4.99 x 2, which then adds up to be a lot. Sometimes the shipping can negate any savings that you will get and it may be better to buy from other sites.   But I like the fact that Amazon will refund your money eventhough the seller ignores you after you have returned the wrong or defective item, as long as you have proof of delivery or some kind of delivery confirmation of course. Plus, even the sellers have ratings like ebay, so they make more effort to offer better customer service to avoid getting dinged on ratings.   Overall a great site!",4,amazon.com

They offer a wide selection of merchandize, and a buyer to listen to samples of CD tracks before they buy They also good checkout and cart system. E-mail annoucements are almost daily and informative, I don't like their system of shipping rates enforced on their sellers's which can be as expensive as the new or used item you are buying. Shipping time by them or vedors is generally very slow and just terrible, You could wait as much a month if you chose ""standard"" shipping, and expedited shipping is tooo expensive. Amazon needs to strike a ""volume"" of merchandize deal with USPS to ship everything at discounted and lower Priority Mail rates.

4329,"My fiancee and I routinely order all manner of goods from Amazon.com.  First the pros: 1. Great selection:  We've ordered everything from roto-tillers, books and MP3s to a garment bag for her wedding dress, all at prices that are better than nearly every reputable retail outlet. 2. Solid packaging:  Unlike most sellers, we haven't run into any issues with damage due to inadequate protection in shipping. 3. Good Marketplace: A wide variety of accredited sellers, giving you even more comparison and shopping power, all on one site. Although the overall experience has been good, I have a few minor issues to note: 1.Beware free shipping: This is kind of a crap-shoot. Sometimes, you'll have your items in a few days, however, there is no rhyme or reason to what gets shipped in a timely fashion. We've had an order of several books shipped from CA arrive in MA in two days, and we've had electronics shipped from KY take nearly 3 weeks to the same address. If you need the items quickly, ignore the free shipping option, and decide if the cost to have the items shipped quickly offsets the slightly lower price. For example, the last round of electronics was slightly cheaper, because of the free shipping, on amazon.com than on newegg.com, with newegg's shipping costs. However, had we ordered them from newegg, we'd have had them in 3 days, and amazon to 20.  2. Be careful with one-click ordering: Although useful, and I think required to order MP3 files, make sure you shut this back off. I accidentally pre-ordered a book using one-click, and didn't even realize it until the book showed up 2 months later! 3. Read the reviews of non-amazon sellers: Although the marketplace is great, make sure you check into the reviews of any non-amazon seller on the site. There are some shady sellers out there, but at least amazon leaves the bad reviews up, unlike some sites (Virgin Mobile and Beckett come to mind)",4,amazon.com
4330,"Amazon is ok, i bought from them expecting low prices and because i was rushed for time to purchase gifts during the winter holidays, i got all my items on time kind of, they arrived at different times due to that they have different vendors selling the products, so its not all coming from the same place at the same time. Also the pricese seemed reasonable until of course it added up with shipping, and i saw the same products at my local target two days later at a cheaper price, what a let down.",4,amazon.com

The company I bought it from just said that they had shipped it, so I couldn't get a refund. The book never arrived.  Amazon was unwilling to get involved. They just told me to talk with the seller. Different reviewers get different community ratings, but it is still sometimes risky. Amazon doesn't accept any liability. I do like that they have movies you can download instantly. You can rent or buy. Itunes takes forever to download, so this is a great alternative. I use netflix, but you can't watch everything instantly on netflix. I wish though that amazon made it easier to search their database. It is a bit difficult to navigate. All in all, they have some good services. I would be careful though buying from 3rd parties.",4,amazon.com
4332,"Amazon has an enormous selection, and is very reliable. However, I have two main issues with it: 1.

I always try to get their free shipping by ordering over $25, but right now I have the prime account (free for students) w/amazingly fast shipping. My one complaint is that if you send a present & don't opt to have it wrapped, they put the note in the box with the present. I thought the note would be a sticker on the box, but it's not.

4339,"1. Video On Demand: they are trying to compete with netflix/itunes/etc, but here is the problem...while they do have a great selection and reasonable prices the quality of the video cannot even begin to compare to that of netflix or itunes right now. Plus they somehow lack the ability to buffer the video, so if your connection slows during playback the entire video stops. This never has happened to me on netflix or itunes. Did I mention this was on a T1 line? They give you the option to download the movie to your PC if the connection is too slow, but here is the catch, if you started watching the video already you have to pay AGAIN to download the video. So make sure you test out their connection before you pay for their VOD services, my T1 line was too slow for them. I give them a meh rating as of 12/2010 but hope in the future they get their act together. They clearly rolled this out before it was ready in hopes to gain market share of the VOD services.  2. Kindle: here I give amazon a full heart, for books they are doing it right. Very seemless and easy to use.

Shipping is often free, though there are sellers on there that charge extra for shipping...it depends on the product. Recently I noticed that return shipping is being charged, if you just ""didn't like it""...if it is in any way their mistake, they pay for return shipping. Not bad!",4,amazon.com
4350,"Have bought many an item from Amazon, they always have had great service and top notch sellers!!",4,amazon.com

4354,ive purchased from amazon about 3-4 times can't remember. i found just about everything i was looking for on here. but there was this one time i ordered some victorian lace gloves for a costume party seller didnt say they were fingerless he even had a picture of the gloves and trust me the picture wasnt fingerless gloves. will i order from amazon again yes i will,4,amazon.com
4355,I like Amazon for the variety of products that can be found there at a reasonable price. However they need to work on the international shipping policy as at the moment the site mainly caters for people who live in the USA. Amazon has a potential to increase their profit if their marketing department spends some time thinking of a future expansion policy.,4,amazon.com

4357,"I like Amazon, very reliable, user friendly, and over the years it has built a strong reputation for itself to where now, I check amazon.com before making many purchases (whether I end up buying online or at a retailer will usually just depend on price).  Actually what reminded me to post this was a new article I just came across that rated Amazon as the ""most trusted brand in America:"" http://gigaom.com/2010/02/22/amazon-the-most-trusted-brand-in-america/ Nothing for me to exactly rave about, but I figured I should at least give them a shout out for doing great work.",4,amazon.com
4358,"I have been an Amazon.com customer for over 2 years now, and I've had pretty much good experience overall. I really like their ""Magazine Subscription Manager"", it's way cool and you can see all your mags, the renewal dates, and then get the best deals (sometimes as low as $5 for a full year!). I pretty much buy all my books from Amazon (with a few exceptions). You just have to be sure that you order like $25 minimum each time you buy things to get the FREE shipping, or that will cost you a lot of money over time. Also the CD's are reasonably priced if you buy your music that way. Overall a good experience, I would recommend them.",4,amazon.com

4362,"Wow, what can I say about Amazon? Will Amazon conquer the world? Will they drive all local merchants to the brink of disaster and extinction? Will all commerce as we know it become nothing more than warehouses of goods? Well at least in my mind that is what has happened as I use Amazon for almost everything. Invariably, when I go shopping for something at malls or even discount centers I rarely find what I am looking for so what do I do? I get on Amazon and sure enough, I find it; usually much cheaper than what I would have paid at a local store. If you think about it, Amazon is like the biggest virtual shopping mall in the world!",4,amazon.com

4381,"I've been regularly ordering from Amazon for at least the last 15 years and have NEVER had a bad experience with them. I think that speaks volumes. I've ordered so many things from them over the years and they have never gotten any of my orders wrong. There have been one or two times when my Prime orders arrived a day later than they were supposed to - but honestly those times are so few and far in between and I really don't care especially considering how much they go out of their way to make things easier for us.  Also, the price matching is great. I'm always able to get things on Amazon for the same or a cheaper price than at other sites, or in store.",5,amazon.com
4382,Amazon is reliable & customer service oriented. Every time I order I know Is will get what I ordered in a timely fashion and if there is any issue they stand behind their customers. prime is well worth the yearly fee.

She immediately told me how to return the product. She gave me a full refund after she received the goods. Will continue buying here!However I must be clear, Amazon can't help if the company gives you something bad quality, but they can refund it.

If you want to match that product for a lower price go to walmart or something. Also for who says they can't find Amazon's phone number.. if you type ""amazon costumer service"" that phone number will be there. Wait, let me do that for you (888 280 4331) Also there is prime for one reason. FREE 2 day shipping, it's 12.99 a month people, don't cry about it.

However after ordering frequently for over 2 years now, I can honestly say that either these issues have been resolved, or I'm always compensated in some way for any inconvenience.  Their prices may not always be the best, their customer service is top notch. You know that you're 100% protected from ""not as advertised"", ""defective"", ""simply not happy with the item/s ordered"" or even ""late or no delivery"". The CSR's are friendly and the company really values customer satisfaction. Their selection is staggering too. Like other large online vendors, they're struggling with fake reviews but they acknowledge it and are working towards resolving this issue....IF it can ever be completely resolved, seeing as the fraudsters always find a ""workaround"". Unfortunately, It's a never ending Cat and Mouse game.",5,amazon.com

4595,"It is 1914 in Hollywood and the craze there is the ""flickers"", silent motion pictures. The biggest star is Mary Pickford, ""America's Sweetheart"". With her long golden curls and the sweetest smiles, her fans adore her. Mary has been sole support of her mother and siblings since she was 8 years old and she will do anything to keep her popularity and wrung on the ladder of success. Never had time for a childhood, or an education, Mary has strong work ethics and is savvy in charming her powerful bosses who rule Hollywood. When she meets Frances Marion, a ""wanna be writer"" for the Silver Screen, Mary tries to talk Frances into becoming an actress but fails. They become close friends and form a personal and professional bond that lasts a lifetime. They become trailblazers fighting for women's rights in the film industry, and both achieve awards, power, the love of a lifetime, and great wealth. Mary Pickford married handsome mega-star, Douglas Fairbanks and they became the Royal Couple. They lived at Pickfair, the elegant 18 acre estate in Beverly Hills. They entertained often and lavishly but it was not the quiet, peaceful, together forever life, Mary dreamed of. In the end, Mary lost Fairbanks and lived at Pickfair alone as a recluse. Fran Marion, too, had the love of her life, marrying Fred until he passed away. Fran became the highest paying screenwriter in Hollywood.  A dedicated fan of Melanie Benjamin, two of her books, ""THE AVIATOR'S WIFE;, and 'THE LAST CHRISTMAS IN PARIS', are two of my favorites.. Ms. Benjamin writes sterling historical fiction and her research is impeccable. Films have always been of keen interest to me and GIRLS IN THE PICTURE is a riveting story that takes us both in front of the camera and behind the scenes with a candid description of the fascinating happenings of that era and the sensational people who lived it. My admiration for both Mary Pickford and Frances Marion for never giving up but reaching the heights but not without heartbreak. This book is highly recommended by me. You will love it. I did! My thanks to Random House e-newsletter giveaway that I was lucky to win. Thank you and Thank you to Melanie Benjamin for another winner. Bravo!",5,amazon.com

Their website has so many awesome products an companies from around the world, I could spend hours an day's looking around, I always find a deal an what I want! Being a Prime member means I get two day shipping on qualifying products and so much more! Prime also includes free tv shows an movies on the Amazon Prime Vidoe app! There's also free music an books too, they also have a sample program that turns your money into sample credit to go towards more samples! I have connected with many great brands on Amazon, I have gotten into reviewing products for free to post my review to Amazon! There is no limit to all you can do on Amazon! I really like that you can connect directly to a seller if you want or need, its great to be able to do that. I can use gift cards from my account an send an receive money on Amazon too! I can't imagine life with out Amazon now! It has become such a large part of my life, it has brought me to many new experiences an people! When you shop on Amazon you know you are with a place you can trust, they do all they can to ensure you get what you want, if there is any issue between you an a seller Amazon is right there to help, call or email an someone will get it sorted fast an most of the time you get extra incentives for any troubles!

4603,"The convenience of pulling up Amazon to purchase day to day needs frees me from the necessity of shopping, which I never found very gratifying. A reasonable membership gives me competitive prices, multiple marketplaces under one roof, and two day delivery to my door. All of the amazon-bashing that I read in the news is based on an obsolete model, and a ignorant comment regarding the USPS-I suspect that Amazon has done more to rescue a fiscally-strained post office than the US government has done in more than 20 years. This site is constantly pulling new offerings to make my life better (music, books, TV, etc). Thank you Amazon, from an appreciative customer!",5,amazon.com
4604,"I love Amazon. I signed up for ""Prime"" not really knowing that I had and Amazon sent me a letter telling of all the features I hadn't taken advantage of. I have not been disappointed with their service or the products they market.",5,amazon.com

4609,"Amazon is the best of all retail on-line services. I use it so much, it was a bargain to become a Amazon Prime member. For $100 a year, free shipping, movies and great series and other video options, not to mention free e-books. When you have seen everything over and over again, month after month on premium cable channels, Amazon prime movies and videos are so much better. Customer service is second to none. They bend over backward to help you with any issue you may encounter. And having been a member of prime more than 3 years, I have only had to contact them one time. That alone is pretty impressive. Nothing beats sitting at the kitchen table in your Pj's, hot cup of coffee at the ready, and do your shopping, without getting out in the cold, and no crowds, no waiting in line. I love it!",5,amazon.com
4610,Excellent customer service. If you are ever unsatisfied for any reason they will resolve it fast. Quick shipping on items. Very good customer oriented company!!,5,amazon.com
4611,"Amazon by far, has the best prices, shipping time and return policy of an vendor online. When I find a product I want to purchase, among all other sites, I add Amazon to the list. 9.5 times out of 10 they have the product at a lower price. Even if it's a few dollars more, I order from them because of superior customer service and return policy. The first action I take is reading the reviews of consumers who have purchased the item to see if it's something I really want.. If that passes the test, I order with confidence knowing that Amazon stands behind every product they sell. I have purchased many items from them in the last 4 years. On several occasions the product was not what I expected or failed to perform. Each time, following the instructions given, I was able to return the item with a full refund. One time, because of a misunderstanding, Amazon even offered and sent me the product for free as an apology. The shipping time is also a major plus and packing is done with great care.",5,amazon.com

4620,"I came to online purchasing late in life. I was very hesitant to put my credit card info out on the web. Plus I always preferred dealing with brick and mortar merchants. If I had an issue I could walk in to the store and resolve my problem. Who knew how online stores would handle customer service. Well Amazon quickly sold me on online purchasing. Both of my kids and most of my grandkids are in other states. Anyone who who has tried to ship anything knows that shipping costs are outrageous. So I tried making a few purchases from Amazon. I always bought enough to get free shipping. I didn't have Prime at first. The first time I had to contact customer service I was so pleased with outcome I decided to stay with them. I'll give you an example of Amazon's customer service. I was given a Kindle Fire as a gift. It was purchased from a Major Electronic Chain Store. Within the first couple of weeks I started having an issue with it. I phoned the Major Electronic Chain Store and spoke to one of their customer service people. I explained the issue to her, giving her the date of purchase and the fact that I did have the receipt. Her response was that I would have to bring it in and if it was something covered under the warranty they would look as t it. But if not then I was pretty much SOL. I had explained in detail to her what the issue was. It did not have anything to do with abuse of the Kindle. It had a clear operating issue. She just kept to the same not interested attitude. I told her to not worry about it. I would call Amazon. But that I would never set foot in her store again again. To this day I have not. I did call Amazon. I made it very clear that the Kindle had been purchased from this other very unhelpful store. They did not care. They sent me a shipping label to return it to Amazon and as shipped me a brand new Kindle. Every time I have ever had to phone Amazon's customer service they have gone above and beyond to make sure that whatever issue I am having is solved. I do have Prime now and I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone. I can spend over a hundred dollars shipping one box to my kids. So the cost of Prime is a bargain. Not only do I have free shipping all year, but free books, movies, and all kinds of other things. I love this company.",5,amazon.com
4621,"I've been shopping with Amazon for many years, and have recently become a Prime member. 99% of my shopping experiences have been positive, and the Prime pays for itself after a few orders! I trust Amazon supremely, and if one needs to contact customer service, they're the best!",5,amazon.com

4624,"Bought a refurbed phone that was supposed to be unlocked for my network. Amazon help me try to officially unlock it and when that failed, they guided me to purchase another one for the same price and return the unworking one at their cost. The 2nd phone arrived in similar condition and we were able to get it working, even though it was originally from another provider. I was very frustrated before and pleasantly surprised after!",5,amazon.com
4625,"I'm a big fan of tech which makes my life easy. Amazon with LEX is just changing the way I do things on a daily basis and for the better. If you want to experience the future, today, getting LEX is a great start.",5,amazon.com
4626,"They have the best customer service. My only issue is UPS tends to leave their packages randomly and I have experienced theft (not Amazon's fault). I had this happen and Amazon replaced the item. I've had DOA items which they replaced on receipt of the item. Interestingly if it's a small low value item they let you keep the defective unit :)  Nice people. My company had a business account and their business support is very responsive. (I'm sure regular support is great too). Edit: I should probably mention they use something close to slave labor, with terrified employees peeing in bottles as they are afraid to take bathroom breaks. I'm not sure I want to shop with them, if this is the cost... My only concern is they are supposedly treating staff badly. I would rather pay a bit more to know that staff are treated ethically and paid well.",5,amazon.com

On other sites I might hesitate to make a purchase that I'm not 100% sure of, but on Amazon, I have the confidence to take a chance, knowing it'll turn out fine, because that's the Amazon guarantee:always a hassle-free, shopping experience with satisfaction guaranteed.",5,amazon.com

I've broken even or better on the cost of my Prime membership with the free two-day shipping alone in each of the past three years. Prime TV and Prime music ends up being a bonus.

I have shopped on-line with Amazon for over 10 years and their refund and/or return policy give buyers the assurance that what is advertised is what they get.

4689,"I love amazon prime, I always get everything on time, no need to go out on this cold weather id you can get in front of your door",5,amazon.com
4690,"Honestly, I never really cared much for Amazon. I thought they were just a blood sucking company like Walmart that put all the small businesses out of business. However, I not only love Amazon because I'm a shopaholic and can find everything I want for usually much cheaper but, they have helped small businesses and entrepreneurs grow their businesses in a way no other company has done. So for that I commend Amazon and will remain loyal. I love their platform and mobile app. The one issue I have with Amazon is the Prime Program. I was a Prime member in the past and it was okay but there was nothing too special. Honestly, I was just using it for 2 day shipping. However, most of my items ship within 2 to 4 days anyway. I really am not that desperate for something to arrive immediately. I also didn't use any of the other benefits like music, shows, books, etc. This is why Prime is a waste for most people. Unless you are going to use all the benefits, it may not be worth it. However, prime never played a major role on whether or not I shop on Amazon.",5,amazon.com

No waiting for $ or anything, done right away and that is he way it should be. When someone tells you that your $ will be back to you in two days! They are playing with your money, it is call making $ on no money. Figure this out... 1000 people gets $ on hold for two days, lets say it is 100.00 Each! that becomes 100,000.00 they can play with for two days, people or banks lets them play with $ on hold.. But not on my watch. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT FOR YOUR $ BACK. The same way they take it, it also can be released right then NOW! Their response is awesome. At some point the item I order came in wrong, and I called they told me they will send me a new one correct and I could keep the other one.. Cheaper to give it away than shipped back?

4721,"They back up their products and nobody gets ripped off. High-quality products, rapid shipping, and wonderful customer service.  check-out is also fast and easy.",5,amazon.com
4722,"I have been using Amazon for many years, and I must say that shopping with Amazon is not only convenient, but they usually have items found elsewhere at a lower price!! My daughter has Amazon Prime, and I think that this service is completely a worthwhile investment. Amazon Prime assures that usually anything marked with a ""Amazon Prime Symbol"" will ship to you in two days or less, and the shipping is completely free. Many of the Amazon Prime products for sale also come with ""Free Returns"". Let me explain. If you make a purchase with Amazon Prime, and the product is listed as ""Free Returns""........you have absolutely no risk in placing your order. When your order arrives with two-day free shipping, and it isn't what you thought it was, or it doesn't fit properly, you just request a return. This then takes you to a page to print out a shipping label for free return shipping of your order, with a refund quickly following the return. How can you beat that for worry-free online shopping??? The pricing on Amazon, on almost any product you can think of, is for the most part, less than purchasing from a brick and mortar store, and certainly less expensive than making your purchase on a different website!!! It pays to know your prices first....as Amazon is sometimes (rarely) the same price or a higher price than other competitors. I use traditional stores to go and touch and check-out an item.....then I go to Amazon to place my order for the same exact product at a substantial savings!!! Amazon is awesome!!! Don't just take my word for it......give it a try!!! Go with Amazon Prime......and if you are not happy with the pricing or service, Amazon will refund your Prime membership in full....no questions asked!!!! Furthermore, there are products on Amazon that you would never find for sale in a normal, run of the mill store. The variety of similar products gives you a wider choice of exactly what you want, and exactly what you don't want!!! For example, go to Home Depot to purchase an electrical meter. You may have two or three choices....that's it folks. Now, go onto Amazon.....type in electric meter....and you may happen to have anywhere from ten to fifty choices with complete descriptions and directions. And, I can almost guarantee that you can find an electric meter at a substantially lower price!!!!! Got to love it!!!!!!",5,amazon.com

I used to shop on ebay--- years ago... Now I only shop there when I cant get what I want, at the price I want, on Amazon, or anywhere else. I have never really had an issue with Customer Service. . . any time I have had an issue, they have always made it right, in one way or another. I believe that people who have had issues with Customer Service, are due the fact that so many 3rd party sellers have problems with their products, and a lot of them offer discount coupons. . .   And you have the Right to ask for a USA based Customer Service Rep.! Or Ask to speak to a Supervisor! Amazon will not refund your full purchase price, from 3rd party sellers, if you have used a coupon code... They will only refund the actual amount you paid. . . you have to contact the seller for the difference--- when you have to pay full price to re-order the item...",5,amazon.com

I also decided to become a Prime Member to save on shipping whenever possible and I do enjoy the additional perks like movie and tv show streaming and books. I own 2 kindles and a fire stick and an echo dot. So I guess you can say I am a big fan. As with any store not always are they the cheapest but I'd say about 70% of the time I can find a great deal. If I have ever had an issue the customer service that I received has always been above board. No hassle returns, sometimes not even having to send things back if reported broken. Last Christmas, I didn't receive one of my packages and they sent out a replacement right away even before they finished trying to track it down.

Amazon actually seems to go out of their way to help the customer, rather than making it difficult for them. Like many people I've got a few things from Amazon over the years, usually without any problems at all. Just recently I had an incorrect item delivered. They no longer had the correct one, but refunded me that day and told me to keep or get rid of the incorrect item. Most other companies would keep you waiting for weeks and won't refund until you return the item, Amazon are better than that.",5,amazon.com

Others' reviews of a 1 star... not so good, and I am in the same position with another, unnamed, well known business for home goods. Okay--it's Houzz.

Always had great dealings with Amazon, as a third party or middle man to transactions the customer service has been excellent. They always try to make good any transaction.

4824,"When I first got into amazon, I was skeptical about online shopping, But the way they treat customers and how easy the process is swayed me. I was first acquainted with the website after purchasing a kindle fire HDX 7 inch and have stuck with them for years. Not only is the process simple and fast, the customer service and warranty service is quick and hassle free. You can increase the speed of which your package arrives to you by either subscribing to amazon prime for free two-day shipping(along with other benefits) or you can increase it's speed by purchasing higher levels of shipping. Not only is it good as a marketplace, but it allows us to communicate with who is going to sell what to us, read customer reviews, get special offers, etc... Even their third party companies are good, I recently purchased a laptop from Woot!, this is a company with the amazon guarantee which meant that it was trustworthy. The one thing I have mixed feelings about is both good and bad in its own way. The amazon appstore offers many apps that you would find in other appstores, some that you get for free if they are listed in amazon underground. Another thing that I love about this appstore are the amazon coins, not only do they allow me to get in app purchases for cheaper than usual, when making a purchase, certain apps give credit back. The only problem is that it lacks a lot of the apps that you would easily find in the google playstore or the apple equivalent. Overall, I believe amazon is a great company that finds a way to make sure the customer is satisfied.",5,amazon.com

5235,"TWO PART REVIEW; 1) Sellers of gently used goods, lend me your ears!     NO longer do you have to wait for an auction to end and pray that your item fetched at least the cost to ship it to its new owner. Amazon is just like being able to sell your items among the premium giants of the online retail businesses........! AT A NEARLY RETAIL PRICE!!!  (That's right I s%&t you not my friends. I wouldn't lie to you, I personally swear by Amazon sellers market and have made close to ten thousand dollars selling used items that I referbished from various sources. Items that would have gone for at least 25%-50% less on ebay and even lower on Facebook or Craigslist.) Did the Facebook reference catch your atention, nearly everyone has Facebook and lover the local buys. But the price is garage sale level and let's face it the market is limited to a few thousand at most. Amazon is nationwide/global and Amazon allows you you view all other products that are the same as the one you are listing and price your according to your competitors prices.  That means if anyone in the entire country is interested in a product that you happen to be selling you will have play in Amazon.  Quick seller? I am! And I priced my listings from $1.00-$5.00 below the lowest priced item(which is barely 10%lower than at Walmart or kohl's and even Best Buy) insuring my product would sell to the first frugal consumer interested in the product.   2)Buyers of o line merchandise!      Amazon has a very strict customer satisfaction percentage requirement for its sellers I think it's like 98.99% positive review rate. Not like eBay in which u can commit to buy just by wanting to see it in your basket for aditional info and get a negative buyer point. Untill I buy it I haven't bought it!  Don't tell me because I am looking around I have to buy somthing I don't want anymore or can't really afford.",5,amazon.com

5323,"I have used Amazon for multiple purchases and have never had to return an item! Shipping is always as promised, actually have received some items earlier than expected. I use Amazon for price comparison on different categories, some times they meet or beat local retail business, so when the price is right, I order from Amazon. They help to keep the competition in check.",5,amazon.com
5324,"I Frequently use amazon, does not always have the best prices, but if they have good service, until today always received the products bought and in the term that were promised.",5,amazon.com
5325,"And I'm loving it. I usually purchase hygiene supplies and electronics from Amazon, but they often have some of the best deals on musical equipment too. Packages arrive in two days so it's not much of a wait. I will probably always be subscribed.",5,amazon.com

I don't know any companies who refund before they receive the item.",5,amazon.com
5332,I've been using Amazon for over 10 years now and have to say that their customer service is hands down the best one out there and some of the Prime deals are pretty darn sweet!! (Too bad they're not as great towards their employees from what I've heard),5,amazon.com

5340,"Amazon has always been pretty good place to shop... I like the product description which is usually very well detailed in nature. True product reviews from real customers helps me to decide in purchases and whether to buy it or not. Dislike having to use postal to return items. Don't really ever know who the seller really is and what kind of guarantee they have on their products. Also, I dislike that Amazon has higher prices than eBay and sometimes the shipping takes longer than it should... Shipping charges too high and Amazon Prime would cost me too much for my budget to be able to handle.",5,amazon.com

5364,"Despite my searches thru other websites for any number of different items, it always seems that Amazon is priced better, shipping is free or cheaper & delivery times are quicker. When they make a mistake, I either get a quick refund without having to return merchandise or it's an easy return. I can't remember having a bad experience with them. I've been dealing with them for many years & usually when a company treats me poorly, I rarely deal with them again. I haven't encountered that with Amazon. They always seem to please.",5,amazon.com
5365,"My favorite online shop, passed ebay now and such a pleasure to buy quality items and reviews. The only issue is to be able to select what is shippable to your country (E.G Ireland)",5,amazon.com
5366,"Most recently, due to the face that I was confused about the arrival time of 2 metal folding chairs, Amazon essentially took my dissatisfaction with a July 4th one day delay and rather than argue with me (I was definitely wrong once I looked at it in retrospect,) They refunded the sizable shipping fee of $13. (it was 2 large metal chairs, I just wanted them fast. The only other 2 times I've had to call customer service, they were perfect and not only fixed my problem, but somehow even increased my trust in them as they made it right,.",5,amazon.com
5367,We love amazon. If we need something we look it up and get it. We are never disappointed. Product quality is great. Items come quickly and if there is an issue it's always taken care of.,5,amazon.com
5368,"With the exception that you can accept the following: You want free shipping? Meet requirements when you checkout items. Whether it's 25 or 49 dollars. Also check that your items come with the possibility of free shipping, otherwise it will NOT count towards free shipping. (Irritating, I know) Not all of your products will be delivered when scheduled. I know that may suck, but that is why Amazon allows you to contact sellers to ensure nothing happens to your products along the way. Some products may never find their way to your home. Which is even more irritating, but the first thing you should do is go on Amazon to contact the seller or file a complaint to Amazon directly. Every time this has happened to me I got promised a full refund within a day or two with no questions asked. (Refunds take time to get to your account. Which implies it will take longer for Amazon to process your refund, it may take up to two weeks to process the full refund) AND SOME PRODUCTS WILL BE ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE BUT THATS WHY WE MUST READ REVIEWS VERY VERY CAREFULLY AND DEMAND (or ask politely) THAT THE SELLER TAKES THE SAID PRODUCT BACK. Some sellers may be very good at making sure you get the product you wanted. Every once in a while I get a card from a seller I buy from, it's handwritten by her, she makes it clear that I can contact her with any questions or concerns about the product. Those types of sellers are the ones that deserve a review, or really any seller that makes sure your product is in ideal condition when it arrives. Make sure you review! Especially if your experience exceeds or falls below your expectations, honestly a lot of customers look at stars and reviews before they buy a product, be sure to encourage/discourage them accordingly.  Last note: If you decide to purchase a product, make sure it's not overpriced or too cheap. Overpricing is an obvious issue which I probably don't have to explain But some products that are underpriced are such terrible quality, and even the sellers might not be all the great either. (That's why you ought to look at reviews!!!!) I can't recommend this site enough for people who wish to shop online.",5,amazon.com

Sometimes it's just not worth the bus fare to go to town, better to order from Amazon and have it arrive to your door.

I always check reviews from private sellers before buying and never go for anyone with a rating below 96% positive. Returns are easy. I've recently subscribed to Amazon prime, thought I would give it a go for a year. I'm loving it. Lots of TV shows and movies, as good if not better than Netflix, free kindle books, and free music with Amazon music and best of all you no longer need to meet the £20 threshold for free next day delivery.

I also use the Subscribe and Save program for items I use regularly, again you have to watch the prices, because you can't assume that the price is locked in at the price you got when you first ordered it. I've done Amazon Pantry, but quit that. The UPS guy comes to my house a lot and I felt sorry for him having to lug those huge, heavy boxes that Pantry stuff is shipped in. I did like the program, just not enough to give the guy who likes my big, bouncy dog a hernia. I also love Kindle books and the Audible program.",5,amazon.com

I still try to price watch and sometimes other sites will have a better price but the determining factors for me are a) how fast can the competitor get items to me and do they charge for shipping b) how easy is it to return or exchange things with the competitor? Amazon will literally do whatever it takes to make you happy. They do not want customers walking away from a purchase unhappy. There have been times when an item quit working or got broken after the 30 day return period and they still did what they could to make it right. The amount of convenience coupled with their superior customer service brings me back to them time and time again. They have a huge selection of everything and they stand behind it all. Amazon Prime is a very well thought out organization that has determined there is great value in repeat business and to keep that business they make sure you're happy. Need to return something? They do all the work - getting you labels, having UPS pick it up etc... they've just really thought it all out and their continually growing business is proof that they're doing things right!",5,amazon.com

5845,"2 Incidents that demonstrate this for me: Oct 2016--I ordered a 45 lbs dumbbell. After I checked the tracking notice, the delivery info said 43 lbs. No biggie, but I messaged Amazon that they might update the page and let others know this can happen, a weight be off a pound or two. The rep responded by apologizing, refunding the payment, and telling me to keep the dumbbell. Outstanding. Feb 2017--Ordered a nice little bookcase from Amazon fulfillment. It came, I assembled it and the middle shelf--the screws didn't line up right. It's not a huge problems, still have the others shelves, just 4 instead of 5. When I sent feedback to support, the rep offered a full refund if I sent it back or (as it was still functioning and useful) she would refund me half of my purchase. I was appreciative of this.",5,amazon.com

5862,"I have always been pleased with my purchases with Amazon. Their deliveries are prompt etc. No problems with returns etc.  As a seller it is very nerve wracking. They are always changing their rules and sometimes without warning. Just before Christmas they put a hold on any brand name merchandise. Many of us had hihg end sneakers, sport products etc. All of a sudden we could not sell theses items without an approval requiring a $1000 application to sell brand name but it was not a guaranteed approval. If not approved than you lost the whole $1000 dollars. I did not get stuck with inventory but many of my friends then had to sell on Ebay or some other site. Huge disappoint and financial loss just before Christmas. ??? So for a seller it is a great site to purchase from but for a seller your account can be terminated or put on hold for very minor infractions??? It is a great site but a site to be very careful of if you are a seller.",5,amazon.com

5872,I have been a fan of Amazon for years. So far no problem with any of the many products I've ordered. I normally read the reviews prior to ordering and base my opinions of if I should buy or not on customer feedback. So far no issues. I will continue to order from Amazon as I have found them to be a lot cheaper for same items found locally at brand name stores. I am a Prime member and love that service as well. I've only had to contact them one time about an item not received and they immediately credited my account. Fan for life!,5,amazon.com
5873,Amazon order number : 114-8083188-1541855. Macys order number: 1391458161..for those who wish to research the validity of this review. I was expecting a shipment from both Macy's and Amazon.com on the same date on about the 15th of March 2017. I received emails that the items we're delivered but upon getting home from work nothing was on the porch as they usually are and I've been a frequent customer to both companies for years.  I immediately called both and both Macy's and Amazon seemed to understand and show interest in helping however Macy's customer service must be in Vietnam because I could barely understand them. They both told me I'd be issued a refund so I'm happy at this point.  However at 8pm on this same date the items from Macys showed up on the porch and several days later at about the same time the item from Amazon showed up. Obviously a delivery error because the UPS info noted left with lady but no lady lives at my address. Although unsure where it was left they we're honest enough to return it to me.  I called both Macy's and Amazon immediately to correct the credits and here's what I found. Amazon actually was truthful and issued the refund while Macy's showed no record of any refund and days later sent me a letter saying because of the shipper note (left with lady) they we're unable to issue a refund.  Good thing this mysterious lady that they spoke of at an unknown address and no signature was honest. My point is it's good to know if there is a problem Amazon is willing to help while Macy's on the other hand will not be getting anymore orders simply because they chose to blame the customer for the shipping error. I'm sure no one at Macys even thought to check my order history and see the thousands of dollars I've spent there over the years.  Sorry Macys.  Youre done until you care for customer. I'd rather shop Amazon now.,5,amazon.com

I'm disabled and it's hard to walk around a store to shop. Being able to get so many things from amazon and receive them in a couple days is immensely helpful for me. The amount I've saved on shipping has more than paid for my prime membership every year. When they do mess up, their service people are willing and able to handle the problem for you. Recently they shipped out an item of furniture after I'd canceled the order. Their automatic return system wanted to charge me shipping to send it back. Five minutes chatting with a CSR and I had a free pickup scheduled for the large, bulky item. Then their automatic system deducted shipping from the credit for the item (their error in shipping a canceled order). Another few minutes chatting with a CSR and I had full credit. Their CSRs can bypass their automatic system to give you quick, efficient, and polite assistance. There's no ""I have to send this to a manager to look into."" I appreciate that. Amazon has quality products, service, and people with very reasonable prices. I love them.",5,amazon.com

5997,"I buy everything on Amazon! I have a prime subscription too. It's so nice to be able to remember something you need so u jump online to Amazon and order it and it shows up quicker than it would have been to find time to run to the store and get it. They even have these dash buttons for a bunch of stuff like laundry soap for example so when u are running low on laundry soap u just tap the button that u stick on the washer and it automatically connects to Amazon and places the order and then a day or two later it shows up. Too awesome! U pay like $4.95 for each of the buttons but once u place an order for the first time u get that back as a $4.95 discount so the buttons are technically free after your first order. Anyways, Amazon has everything! I love it. I have probably spent over $100,000 buying almost everything for my house, car, and family from the site. The prices are 98% of the time better than anywhere else online and it couldn't be any easier to return a wrong or damaged package (assuming u order it through prime). If anyone doesn't use Amazon as a shopping choice then u are missing out on one of the best shopping options of the new era and it only keeps getting better as the progress. Whether it's a part for your car or a toy for your kid or a product for your lawn, you should always be checking out Amazon.com!!! PS... I didn't get paid to say any of this and I rarely do reviews but for Amazon I would post a review just like this anytime!!!",5,amazon.com

Plus it's half the price of going to Barnes & Noble and you save gas... One serious note: in the past 6 month I've noticed that probably 50% of the products on the house from China I mean they act like it's an American company they just broker in China so many of these things phone batteries 2 printer ink. So you must be very careful because things are changing on that website and the quality is not top quality like it used to be. Sometimes they let you know it & sometimes they don't. A Sure way to find out is a good part of the stuff with an 8-10 day lead time is probaly/coming off a boat from China. So don't let the extremely low priced items fool you. There's always a catch. AMAZON SHOULD be careful because Trump will start banning them & then ruin it for all the Amazon Great customers, like myself :-( I know I can't live without them so I hope they shape up..on a positive note they offer a chance to return items for free. Customer service is very good I mean you don't get a real person but you do it online and they answer promptly. Rarely, do they deny a return.

Of course, Amazon offers items from its own warehouse, but they also offer the same items from third party distributors. EVEN THEN, if there is a problem,my experience is that Amazon will take care of you. I've had to return items - Amazon paid return shipping.  I've gotten items that were defective and the seller disappeared. Amazon gave me a refund. I've had warranty issues with third party seller - Amazon made good on my purchase.

I do admit, I have found it I choose my item ""fulfilled by Amazon"" I have a really fast turnaround time. There have been times when I must choose from a seller directly.    ALWAYS read the reviews on the seller you choose, they are usually helpful, you will be able to tell the ones that are actual reviews and not just *itch sessions from the consumer. The reviews give you a very good idea of how the seller responds to problems, the quality of the items and if they stand behind their guarantee.   I always leave a review for sellers, since I occasionally sell on Amazon I know how valuable the feedbacks are to a seller. Judy in Alabama, Oct 2016",5,amazon.com

I compare prices, look for sales or warehouse overstock and read customer feedback, while sipping a cup of coffee or iced tea. Make my choices, select my delivery options--sometimes 2 days away sometimes a week (for extra credit on future buys), and I know I can return, for free, anything unsuitable.

6538,"I just love love love amazon. One click and I bought something. It's quick, easy to navigate, can find anything and everything on Amazon!!!",5,amazon.com
6539,"I buy virtually everything online (from TVs to automobile tires, to door hardware, to food items), and Amazon has been an essential tool for getting what I want easily, quickly, and usually at or near the best possible prices. There's no one out there doing as good a job of supplying almost any product imaginable than Amazon.com. But....you don't always get the best price, and all too often their collection of sales tax makes them uncompetitive. So I use Amazon to easily find exactly what I want, and then I make sure there aren't less expensive purchase options available within Amazon. And that's what makes Amazon such a great site and tool--they help you find the cheapest deals if you use them wisely. For example, after searching the most obvious prices available on Amazon, you need to find and click on the Available from These Sellers link to see your options. Those options almost always allow you to place an order with independent 3rd party sellers who don't collect sales tax, and many also provide free shipping, or qualify for Amazon Prime shipping benefits. But don't stop there, you also need to click the See All Buying Options button. That's where you may find your item being sold with free 2-day shipping, for example, (which might otherwise never have been available if you hadn't searched a bit further).  I also have an Amazon Prime membership which saves time and money on shipping while also giving me Amazon Prime movies and TV programs, including some great original series. Is everything less expensive using Amazon? No, it's not, but searching that item within Amazon and outside of Amazon provides you almost effortless comparative pricing. So deciding where to get the best overall deal becomes extremely easy. And whenever I'm in doubt and prices are almost identical, I'll usually play it ""safe"" by going with Amazon so that I can easily return an item on a hassle-free basis. That in itself has been one of the best features of Amazon.com. Remember that Amazon makes buying online extremely easy, but it's real value is as a price comparison tool for finding the best deal possible in the shortest amount of time. Although Amazon.com may not always prove to be the least expensive online seller, the website makes finding the best possible deals incredibly easy. Add to that their hassle-free return policy, and they absolutely deserve the highest ratings possible.",5,amazon.com

These days I hardly ever shop in brick and mortar stores. And anytime I need something I check Amazon first to see if I can find exactly what I am looking for. I don't look elsewhere once I find it, because I know I am not going to find better prices elsewhere. Even when I have purchased items that did not meet my needs in reality, returns are as easy as going to your account, finding the order, and let Amazon know what you are interested in returning.

You can pay a variety of ways, get e-books instantly, and make wish lists easily. You can even order with one click if you choose to set up that option. Amazon doesn't always have the lowest prices, but often does, so check around online and even in your local stores before you order. Some businesses in your town may even price match Amazon if you ask and their policy permits it. One thing I have noticed is that prices can fluctuate wildly, sometimes even the same day, so if you find what you want at a great price you might ought to get it--it might cost more tomorrow (or less)!

6930,"A while back I had ordered a similar product for my wife's car and my mother in law decided she just absolutely had to have one too. As a pleasant surprise for her we ordered her this one, and she loves it. They have 3 dogs and any given day they are taking them in the car to the petstore or vet for whatever reason and this so far has proven to be a lifesaver for her. The hammock feature helps keep the dogs from sliding down into the footrest area, while also providing a slight barrier to help keep them from climbing into the front of the car. The fact that dog hair is not getting all over her nice leather seats doesn't hurt either. While I did receive this item at a discount on the grounds that I would review it up receipt and use I can honestly say that my opinions in regards to it have not been swayed by that fact. This is a quality solution for a unique problem that I strongly recommend to anyone with animals.",5,amazon.com

6949,"We use it on a daily basis. Amazon makes shopping a pleasure. You don't have to go thru the hassle of getting dressed, driving to the store, finding a parking place & dealing with sales people (most of whom are on a commission so they worry you to death by being pushy, insistent & aggressive to make a sale & earn $$$). You have to find a dressing room, undress to try on clothing (when the dressing room is usually a mess from prior custormers use), get dressed and go to checkout where the sales person will try to get you to sign up for the store' card (when you already have Visa or Mastercard, etc). Then you have to trek back to your car and deal with traffic going home, Amazon eliminates all the above aggravation (you can sit in your ""PJ's) drink your coffee, eat your snack and browse at any hour day or night, compare all your items of interest, make a decison, pay with your card, then click to complete the purchase.

6980,"I have been using Amazon for about 15 years now and I have seen Amazon go through a number of changes. I am currently an Amazon Prime member and since I buy a lot of items from Amazon, the two day free shipping is something that keeps me coming back. I must admit however that I also bounce each purchase off of Ebay because you can often find cheaper items there and you do not have to usually pay the tax there. Also Ebay offers Ebay Bucks for most purchases that accumulate quarterly and you can use those bucks towards any purchase sometimes getting things for free. The shipping usually takes a few days longer to get to you but if it is something I don't need right away, I will go to Ebay instead of Amazon. It's also usually a little tougher if you have a problem with a purchase because the hoops you have to jump through at Ebay, make it more of a pain that Amazon which is very liberal in it's return policy. With Amazon now trying to get into groceries, I cannot wait to see how this shakes out.",5,amazon.com

It is not unusual for me to order an item that shows up the next day. Returns are just as easy, however, if you return something that 'you did not like' as apposed to does not work or was not what the description stated, they take the return cost out of your refund. When you request a return, they send you an email with a shipping form to print. I use Amazon a lot, but I also do a 'google' search for the product to be sure it is the best price. I find in most cases when you add the shipping from the other vendor Amazon comes out lower. And I keep in mind the easy return process.",5,amazon.com

7055,"I love Amazon. Since I despise shopping, this is a great option. Jeff Besos is a genius, of course. His idea for customer service relations is a business model every on-line seller should use: generally, no questions asked return. And the response time is within seconds of asking for a return phone call or email. The only thing I do not like is a part of the Amazon Prime program. I've found that when I use Prime to shop, the item is generally higher than if I bought it through another vendor. The trick may be their free 2-day shipping promise. Other vendors may take longer to ship, but the cost is often much less. For example, if you look for a book and it's $18 on Amazon with free shipping, you may be able to find the same one for $5 plus shipping of about $3.. That could be a lot less expense for you. But the ""free shipping"" idea makes the buyer more likely to purchase it through Amazon. Plus the fact that you've paid your $$ up front for Prime services, would probably make a buyer use Amazon Prime services. It's a rather tricky marketing tool, but it works for them. It's sort of the ""you pay me now or you pay me later"" mentality.",5,amazon.com

7139,"I order from Amazon weekly, if not more often, and am amazed at the swift delivery, the ease of returns, and the amazing breadth of products offered. My only concern has been with the packaging a few times--I ordered some liquid garden products that included organic pest control. That came in a large box that also included a WaterPik & accessories. The bottles of garden products leaked all over the box and other contents, and it leaked all over the postal carrier's vehicle. Amazon replace the items, which was nice, but the stink and aggravation was unwelcome... No edible or health care products ever should be packed with pest control products--no commonsense there! On another occasion, I ordered a three-jar pack of Lingonberries. These were bound together in a manner that would suggest safety, but the middle jar was smashed and leaked sticky goo all over everything else in the box--insufficient packing material had been used--those air pillows had shifted all over, the box was too large, and it seemed, again, that commonsense was absent in the packing process. Amazon always replaces items such as this, but they could save money and time and customer anger if a little more ""thought"" went into the packing process. If robots pack, however, they need to be programmed accordingly ;)",5,amazon.com

7211,"I am very seasoned consumer on Amazon and have just experienced a few watch outs. Pay very close attention to small details especially when you need a product in a short time frame. Primarily, when the product is not coming from an Amazon fulfillment center. In the last 2 weeks I had 2 orders bite me. One was coming direct from China and the other from India. The China order was simply a pair of mini USB power cords, great price, 2 for $5.49. The deal was so great I missed the details, ordered at 8:00 PM, by 11:00 PM I was notified that the product was already shipped. Blown away, however, it was really shipped the next business day as it was coming from China. And it was sent regular mail. Goty the product 3 weeks later. So my haste cost me as I had ordered for a friend who required the product right away. The order from India, also took 3 weeks, but this was goofy, maybe culture or whatever, they shipped the product registered mail. What a royal pain. I have product shipped to my condo in Florida and my neighbour puts the product away for me awaiting our return. UPS and FedEx are great, they know our place always leave it where required. But registered mail, it became a nightmare. Hope my short comings help you in the future.",5,amazon.com

I wanted to keep it and was given a fair discount to pay for a professional surf shop repair.

7304,"I'm a tough one to please when it comes to online buying & selling, but Amazon deserves 5 stars.  As a buyer: You're dealing with multiple sellers. Amazon is more like the watchdog. They hold the sellerz to high standards & it works out well. I've never had a problem with any orders. The prices are decent & the quality has always been as I expected. I buy often, especially at Christmas so it was worth it for me to buy the Prime membership. The bonus is that you get a LOT of free movies you can watch on TV (like Netflix), plus movies you can buy right from the TV. I've gotten several popular ones for $10-15. As a seller: You have to keep in mind that they do take a commission & price accordingly. A little tip- don't price anything below $8. As long as you're honest in your description, taking pictures if needed, you'll be fine. They make it easy to have your item listed in 5 minutes. They even suggest a price range based on others that are listed. When we decided to down scale & got rid of a lot of stuff I was making $90 a day. A lot more than I would have gotten at a yard sale. I'm helping my brother in law get rid of his books. He has over 200, way more than I can store. With Amazon all I do is list them, & with one little checkmark I notify Amazon that I want them to take over. They have me print out a label & I box & ship them for them to handle. They store them, ship them, collect the money, handle any customer questions & notify me of what I've sold & my profit. The money is deposited right to my bank account. You can do this with anything you sell.",5,amazon.com

They offer free shipping on orders over $35.00 and on many items, but you need to check the seller's policy too. They offer free returns, but not always.

7330,"Amazon.com is most likely the best online marketplace you'll ever encounter! Jeff Bezos, the creator of Amazon.com had many complaints on where to find specific items, especially the rare ones, but didn't have time to look at all the stores and online shopping sites for them. He spent many years trying to figure out why, and then it suddenly hit him. He realized there was no such place to buy everything the world has to offer. He then spent many years in website development until he came across a rather unusual phenomenon. The place he was dreaming of was right before his eyes, and with that in mind, he decided to become the founder of such a project. He spent many days trying to come up with a good international name for the company, and then finally decided to name it after one of the most restricted places in all of South America - Amazon (based off the Amazon River). The website's focus has, and always has been the practice and motto of the customer always being right, making it the best place to find exactly what you need, even if they don't necessarily sell what you're looking for 100% in the United States. In fact, many useful products that are imports are being sold to authorized United States retailers today, some of which the seller has opted to allow Amazon to fulfill the delivery of the products. Although the site has a good reputation, there are sometimes criminals that create fake merchant IDs to either steal your money, or otherwise provide you with counterfeit products in your order. For this kind of case, Amazon.com had created the A-to-Z Safe Buying Guarantee, to help protect buyers from potential fraudulent sellers. Even criminals who close their Amazon.com accounts before the order is complete can still be subject to the system, as the seller ID remains on Amazon.com servers until the 60-day A-to-Z claim filing period has passed, making this the safest place to buy with confidence. If you're ever looking for a hard to find item, who knows! It just may be on Amazon! I'd highly recommend it!",5,amazon.com

7414,"When it comes to finding a slimming belt that gives you that highly-coveted flat tummy, while providing the conditions your body needs to burn off excess fat, most waist trimmers fall short of the mark. Personally, I've tried a number of slimming belts in the past, and found that the majority are either too tight and uncomfortable to allow for a proper workout, or so absorbent that it felt as though I was carrying around a week's worth of sweat! This waist trimmer is an incredibly well-made neoprene belt (with rubber lining), that's been backed by a lifetime warranty for even greater piece of mind. Both the 9"" width and 42"" length are suited for a wide range of sizes. In fact, both myself and my wife can use the same slimming belt! What's more, the placement and strength of the Velcro fastenings are ideal for great support and no unwanted chafing.  The first time I wore this waist trimmer, it wicked away moisture so quickly that I didn't even take it off for SIX hours. At first, I thought it was another failure that didn't work because I didn't feel wet in the slightest - even after jumping rope. However, when I removed the belt I was actually dripping with sweat underneath, even though the slimming belt itself dried out almost immediately when laid aside. One of the best things about this waist trimmer is that the design helps to keep me mindful of my posture, and keeps me tightening my abs throughout a workout. What's more, as a slimming belt, it provides a surprising amount of back support, while appearing to give me a flatter (more attractive) stomach.  Unfortunately, if you're thinking that this slimming belt will raise your metabolism and shed pounds for you without diet and exercise then you're going to be disappointed. The truth is that no waist trimmer works like that. Instead, you use your slimming belt while exercising to improve your core temperature, which enriches circulation and leads to great metabolic changes. Rather than losing belly fat instantly, you might lose temporary water weight which you'll then regain. However, your workouts will be more effective, and you might be able to achieve the ideal body faster. I know it's working for me!",5,amazon.com

The big convenience the product can be shipped to my address and I don't have to go run around see it availability to buy it and waste time on the road. Like everyone I want to save time and money so always check where would be a good buy,5,amazon.com

7479,"If you've owned a bird, you know they like to chew on things. It is good for them at stimulates them and keeps their beak sharp. This rainbow bridge bird toy is very nice for birds the size of a cockatiel or larger. It would be great for any parrots or macaws or cockatoos or something like that as well. All of the pieces are made of natural wood that are on the bridge their flat pieces and then there are round balls in between them. They are strong with a stick a leather. The only pieces I really do not care for on this toy are the chain links. They are just a hollow plastic material. I do not think those will hold up very well. The rest of the toys made very well. It is 18 inches into end. From into it and I mean from the end of one clip to the end of the other clip. These quick clips are very nice you can hang this horizontally or vertically in your cage you can either it is 18 inches into end. From into and I mean from the end of one clip to the end of the other clip. These quick clips are very nice you can hang this horizontally or vertically in your cage. You can hang it from the top of your cage by either and since there is a hook on each end. It is a pretty sturdy clip so will hold up. Also, since there is a hook on each and you can turn it over to have either end of the top. This would not be long enough to go side to side across a birdcage that would hold a larger bird. However, this would work diagonally in a cage going from the side to the back or from the front to the side. Most birdcages have a perch across the cage. If this is the case with your bird it is probably best just to hang it vertically from the top of the cage towards the bottom of the cage. This way it would move more when they played with it. Pros: bright colors, natural wood to chew, sturdy clips on each end. Cons: Plastic chain pieces will break easily with a large bird.",5,amazon.com

Often, Amazon has better prices, and they've got plenty of brands to choose from and lots of reviews to look at. It's wise to look into the company you're ordering from if it's not directly through Amazon, because the products may not be good quality. However, I've ordered indirectly through Amazon many times and I've been perfectly happy with what I've gotten. Also, take a look at the shipping time, because I've ordered several things from China before through Amazon and it took a month to get to my house. I didn't mind waiting, but some do.

I called the vendor that night, very upset and demanded they take them back. They sent me a return authorization, but when I saw the credit issued, I went through the roof. Not only did they charge me the shipping (they said they wouldn't), but they only refunded me the lower price of the synthetic, not the more expensive leather. Meanwhile, the vendor got busy and went to their Amazon listing and changed the description of the shoes. After several phone calls and going in circles with the vendor, I contacted Amazon. They pulled up the order, verified the description at the time of purchase and the amount charged and refunded, and when I hung up the phone I had my full purchase price refunded to me including the shipping!

In over 10 years, I have spent over $30,000.00 at Amazon.com and its all been money well spent. Last year I relocated to the Orient and have used Lazada.com and Aliexpress.com. Lazada does pretty good but they need to work on their shipping and delivery. Aliexpress is a joke and wouldn't trust them with my mother-in-laws dead cat.

7875,"A resolution regarding my original review. I was contacted the following day via email by one of the customer service rep's I had encountered regarding my return and reorder of my boots. I replied with the same information that was in my original review. I received a response email from an Amazon supervisor regarding my horrible experience. She was sympathetic and assured my experience with the two rude and unsatisfactory customer service reps would be forwarded to their appropriate supervisors. The supervisor that contacted me regarding my purchase and return issue went above and beyond to rectify the issue. She adjusted my price to the original sale price I paid, plus an additional discount, and upgraded the shipping for my return purchase. I have to say that Amazon step up and handle the entire situation to my satisfaction. I only hope that the original two customer service rep's that rudely spoke to me, and had no desire to rectify the issue had hand was reprimanded and had some additional customer service training. This was my original ordeal and complaint regarding a recent customer service issue with Amazon. I ordered a pair of boots on Cyber Monday and got 20% off and free shipping. I ordered the size I wear and when I received them they were to long. I wanted a even exchange for a small size. The website doesn't have the option for you to do an exchange online. So, I called Amazon customer service regarding an exchange. The customer service representative emailed me a return label, I was told they would refund me & I could replace the order. Then call customer service and they would adjust the price for the amount that I originally paid for it. I placed my order tonight, call customer service to do the price adjustment. First the girl was not listening or could not understand what I was calling about. After great frustration I asked for a supervisor, and I explain what the rep I spoke to regarding the return/exchange told me about calling and asking for the price adjustment. I was treated like I was telling a lie and making up the fact that their representative advised me of ask for the price adjustment. I was kept on hold for 58 minutes, still without resolution to the issue I called about. I was spoken down too, spoken over top of, rude, arrogant, and short of being called a liar, in the most condescending and nasty way. I was screamed at ""we don't offer or do exchanges, and we do not do price adjustments, that they would do a ""One Time"" exception."" I explained it was their representative that specifically told me how to make my exchange and get them price adjusted so it was the same cost to me. It was the WORST customer service I had ever encountered. And I told her so, when I asked her name she screamed it at me. When I asked for a supervisor she said she didn't have one. I told her I was not born yesterday, nor was I stupid. She definitely a boss of some level, and I was certain of this because I know she was not the owner of Amazon. I have been in customer service most of my life, and I know what good customer service is, and take pride in my job. Something tell me this Amazon customer service rep did not have any respect or pride, and certainly does not need to be working with the public. She told me they ""do not do exchanges"" and I could take her offer or forget it that was ALL they were going to do for me. No where on the website does it say they don't do exchanges. The actual web page that you go to for returns, it actually states for ""Returns, Refunds, or Exchange"". Needless to say I will not be purchasing anything else from Amazon. Very disappointed in being treated like I was a liar and beneath her (Kristy the supposed Supervisor). I have been in customer service for almost 40 years and I have NEVER treated or spoken to anyone in that manner or tone. It is disrespectful, and unprofessional.",5,amazon.com

7893,I use Amazon Prime and love the extra service and perks. Almost everything I need is obtainable from my desk at home. Prices are very competitive and product reviews and specifications are generously provided. 2 day delivery is standard and the shipping is usually free. The downside is I really need to get outside more. Also I find shopping inside a brick and mortar store more culturally satisfying. My purchases so far which are significant have almost always met my satisfaction. I have only had to return one item out of hundreds. Price guarantee is an Amazon policy but collecting a refund after the fact requires a lot of obscure website navigation. Make sure you are ordering what you really want when you 'pulled the trigger' on your order. Chances are if you change your mind the order will already on its way and it will be too late to renege.,5,amazon.com

But if you do not want to bother for the big items like TV or Sofa, this should be a good choice. Yes, they deliver within 2 days or your money actually back. And also the non-common items.

It is obvious Amazon cares about customer satisfaction and their vendors value their partnership with Amazon.",5,amazon.com
7904,"I've been shopping at Amazon since 1994, and always come back.

7909,"Incredibly fast one or two day shipping if you are a prime member.  Real hassle free returns as well unlike other merchants. And almost everything you need.

And if you don't want 2-day prime delivery, you can select standard shipping and get free money credited to your next purchase or an ebook or an audio book! Clever idea! Good place for cheap furniture, household items, and LOTS of other stuff. I don't usually rec. buying makeup from Amazon unless it is cheaper/harder to find elsewhere. Definitely DO NOT buy mascara there. Some sellers have old nearly expired mascara.",5,amazon.com

They lead all of their competition in every way!!!!!!!!",5,amazon.com

7952,"I have been shopping at Amazon.com for over 10 years and there has never been a problem they have not been able to fix for me. When I ordered an item and it didn't arrive on time (so I no longer needed it), they allowed me to return it at no charge. When an item I purchased did not work when I tried to use it, they allowed to to return it at no charge and credited my account in full so that I could order something else. When the case I thought was meant for my Kindle Fire was for the wrong generation, they did not even make me return it but credited my account in full so I could go back in and find the product that was appropriate for me. Almost every single order I have ever placed (hundred's of them) have arrived before the expected arrival date and although I am not a prime member I have received many things in the typical 2 day shipping time frame normally reserved for them (even when selecting the free shipping option). Overall, I cannot find one thing to complain about when shopping with Amazon.com, they have the lowest prices on most everything I need and are always go above and beyond in the rare event that there is a problem.",5,amazon.com

7954,"Love Amazon. Prime member and use it beyond what I pay for. Had a few issues with outside sellers on Amazon, but customer service team were promptly solving the problems. My recommendation is to check reviews when an item is not fulfilled by Amazon directly, but by a third party seller. Sometimes the goods are delivered from China or Europe and can take a while to arrive. It is always displayed next to the item you purchase. If shipped by Amazon you don't have to worry.

8000,Delivery always on time quality products,5,amazon.com
8001,"Amazon.com is an online shopping website. They sell everything from new to used at a cheap price. Rather if you're looking for a guitar to rock out on, an outfit to dress like a diva, get the latest gaming accessories or whatever you're looking for you'll certainly be a satisfied customer. It normally takes up to a week (Including business days) to get your order, or if you have amazon prime you get it in a little as two days. To get amazon prime you must pay $99 a year after a one month free trail or pay $49 a year (if you're a student) after a 6 month free trail. Amazon prime not only gives shipping in two days, but it's free as well. That's right, FREE shipping and handling. You also get early access to the newest stuff, you get to stream thousands of movies and TV and get unlimited access to your favorite songs. They even allow you to sell your own stuff on the website or trade it in for cash. If you're not satisfied with your purchase just get in contact with the seller and ship it back to them and you'll get your refund. But however there is one con. Some of the sellers are rip-off artist, procrastinate and sometimes lie saying the package is on the way. They'll sometimes lie and say your order is in perfect condition when it's not, and not take care of it after you paid for S&H. So should you should probably check the ratings and comments on the item the sellers selling, before you buy anything. But cut off those rotten apples and you got a perfect tree. The scam buyers really doesn't do anything to my 5 star review for Amazon, due to it's great customer service and refund policy. Are you still reading this? Go to amazon right now, and get what you need for lower prices in a short amount of time! https://www.amazon.com/",5,amazon.com

8048,"When you figure the time and money required to shop in person, prices at Amazon are EXTREMELY competitive, but what cinches the deal is their customer service. When I ordered disposable bakeware, they shipped a package of 2 instead of 4 packages of 2. When I asked for the rest, they sent me a full refund. When I ordered 20 pounds of Basmati rice at an exceptional price, and got 10 pounds, they gave me a choice of getting a second 10-pound bag, or a 50% refund.  Anybody can make a mistake, including Amazon, but Amazon is quick to make it right, no quibbling, often giving the customer more than he asked for. I wish Amazon were running for President!",5,amazon.com
8049,"Alright, what can I say that most folks don't already know. Amazon.com is an amazing website backed by awesome customer service. The best way to appreciate the full benefits of Amazon is to become a ""Prime"" member for $99 a year. Trust me, the money that you save from the free 2-day shipping benefit alone will add up to over the cost of the membership if you are a frequent online shopper. There are also other benefits of ""Prime"" such as starting a music library from their online music collection, getting a choice of a free e-book every month, getting a preview of deals before they start, unlimited video streaming of ""Prime"" movies and TV series. There is something for everyone and it can be shared with members in the same household (at least the free shipping part can). UPDATE: You can share your entire Kindle library to an adult member in your house that owns a Kindle. If you ever need to return something, you can print the return label from your computer and just drop your package off at a UPS store. The credit back to your account is usually very quick. Like I said, great customer service!",5,amazon.com

Go to a store and things like this won't be on the shelves, just the newer lines and accessories. Click and your order is at your front door in 1 or 2 days, even on Sunday.  No driving, no parking, no lines, no self-check out register that can't read your bar code and tells you that an attendant is on the way.

And one of the best features of Amazon is, any time I have to return something I bought from Amazon, no problem. I get my refund fast too. There are two cons to Amazon: 1. They don't include a return label with the item, I have to print it out which is a hassle for me, or they will mail me a label for $1 on request. 2. If you buy from another seller, other than Amazon, it can end up being a battle, and there might be a restocking fee, so read each sellers return policy.

8205,"I have been shopping in Amazon for quite a long time. I started by buying books. Then I bought Kindles. I have four Kindles as of today because I am a reading enthusiast. During the time I was buying books and Kindles, I discovered other areas of shopping and I am glad I did so. This is the easiest way of shopping, and for several years now, I haven't died of fatigue by going from store to store to find any one item. The best thing I can say about Amazon is their consistency and promptness. Whatever I have ordered always arrived on time, and the only thing I returned was accepted with courtesy. Aside having good prices and fair trading, Amazon is a place one can find just about anything. Which consumer could ask for more?",5,amazon.com

One time I had something delivered but was gone when it came so the postal carrier stuck it in my door and somebody came along and stole it.

Amazon when they got wind of my missing package sent me something in replacement. That has been my experience with them and I am sure glad that they were willing to help me like that.

8379,"As both a seller and a buyer on Amazon, it is not without its problems, but is overall, a good place to shop for just about anything you want for lower costs than what you would normally pay at big box retail stores, plus you generally do not have to pay any tax which is a huge savings as well, but if you order anything under $35 or have a total order of $50 from two different sellers, then you still have to pay shipping unless you have Prime and the shipping is usually much higher than what it actually costs to ship the item. You may also discover that the seller does not take returns or that you have to pay to ship it back. You may also get damaged items that arrive from China and would cost more to ship back for a return, so there are some disadvantages, especially when shopping for clothes which look great on-line, but fit poorly or are made cheaply. In short, it is best to use Amazon for things you find locally and like, but are too expensive to purchase. Then go to Amazon and find the same thing for cheaper so you know exactly what you are getting. Be sure to take advantage of the reviews for items as well which will help you know if something runs small or large or holds up well over time. Don't write a review on an item you have purchased until you have used it for at least a month as you may discover that the deal that you got was really not a deal in the long haul. The three things I like most about Amazon: they have hard to find items you may not be able to purchase locally, especially if you live in a small town; they allow you to read reviews of the items and store things in a wish-list that you can give to others who might want to buy you something but don't know what to get; they often have better bargains and indepth descriptions so you can take your time and really read about the good and bad before making a purchasing decision without being pressured by a salesperson. I also like that you can order downloadable books and music and rent textbooks. The three things I dislike most: You cannot combine shipping on similar items and don't really know who is selling what until you go to check out; many of the items they offer can be found cheaper on eBay, sometimes as much as $30 cheaper for an item under $100 and sellers list things between $43 and $98 and it usually turns out that the $43 item is some terrible color or a size only 2% of the population can wear, so it can be misleading and causes you to hunt and search rather than go directly to what you want at the price you are willing to pay. Lastly, shipping can be really slow without Prime and costly as well and free returns are not a guarantee, so there is always a risk factor involved that makes buying new items a bit nerve wracking. Amazon could improve by having an Amazon Central store where all items came from one location, so you could order your nutritional needs, buy a pair of shoes and order a new part for your washer and dryer and have them all ship free in one box with a guarantee that you could return them for free if they were not what they were advertised to be. Shop around before purchasing on Amazon because you could lose money on that ""deal"". They may also not have the latest items in stock. Selling on Amazon is another matter and sellers are not really protected from unscrupulous buyers the way they are on eBay. Still, overall, Amazon offers a valuable service with fair prices and ships to your door, so is great for those who really do not want to hassle with fighting crowds or deal with pushy salespeople who won't let you browse on your own.",5,amazon.com

8413,"Nothing will take the place of print books! There is a feeling, a panache if you will, in holding a book in your hands, in flipping pages back and forth and yes, in savoring the aroma of the pages, be they newly printed or reeking with the mustines that comes of great age in a quiet library. Kindle cannot match the timelessness of a print book. But they don't have to! What Amazon Kindle does is to enable new writers to essentially ""self-publish"" and to allow the market-place to decide the worth of the book on its own. It stands by itself, or it fails based on how it is received by the on-line community. And while Amazon has not yet figured out how to waft the aroma of books electronically, or to fold back the corner of a page for future reference, it succeeds in providing a convenient way to read a book -- nay, MANY books -- in a compact format. You can read on your computer screen, on a tablet or on a smart phone, limited only by the amount of charge in your battery. Kindle books are sometimes offered free for various periods of time. This is often a marketing tactic to stimulate demand for an author's work. Otherwise, Kindle books typically range from 99 cents to perhaps $9.99. They are delivered instantly to your reader and they are yours forever. Also, when you read a book on Kindle, you might love it enough to go out and buy a hard copy to grow old with . . . or to have the author sign. I just bought a hard copy of Caroline Glick's excellent analysis, ""The Israeli Solution,"" after reading it on Kindle, and she signed it. Reader, go, search Kindle. Find a book that you have to read. Buy it. Read it. Repeat.",5,amazon.com

I used to work for AOL back in the day and I can safely say that there are a few things users want... enough 'white space' not clutter their screen... convenience (one stop shopping)... and ease of use (navigation, as few ""clicks"" as possible, etc). Amazon has that, and more.  I do the majority of my Chrismas shopping on Amazon and even orders placed a couple of days before the holiday have arrived at my door in time to wrap and place under my tree. I've purchased everything from makeup to food items, electronics to kitchen gadgets, and more.

8658,"Amazon, especially with Prime Membership, is far and away the best overall online store. The selection is unmatched, and the prices are almost always the best you can find, or very close to it. Prime is worth it for the free 2nd-busines-day shipping. I do not use other Prime services like music or Amazon Video or anything else. If Amazon raises the price of Prime Membership significantly, then I would have to decline, particularly if their justification is all the added Prime features that I do not use. Otherwise, I cannot rate this store lower than any other I've come across, ever.",5,amazon.com
8659,They always try to resolve your problem. I have had prime for years. It is the best! So far only one error since they opened. I buy at least 100 things per year. GO AMAZON!,5,amazon.com

I've had to exchange one item and the seller was easy to work with and followed up to make sure I was happy with the exchanged product! This site is a definite favorite!!",5,amazon.com
8664,"I am an Amazon Prime member. I place several orders each month and the order process is clean and simple I like the 2 day free shipping and there is never a problem with returns. I would prefer that all orders would be fulfilled directly by Amazon rather than by other suppliers, and they should never use USPS for the last mile of shipping, prefer UPS. But overall I am a very happy Amazon customer.",5,amazon.com
8665,"This purse offers bright and vibrant colors which are sure to get noticed and have you getting compliments. On the back is has the same colors but strips instead of block/diamonds on the front.The metal accents really make this bag pop and offer a step up to the design. I was offered this purse to sample for evaluation. I did not promise to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest, unbiased review. The straps on this purse offer as suitable thickness which is perfect to carry comfortably. The zipper on this purse is a metal one with a metal pull, so it is sure to last. The inside is lined with a durable material and inside of this purse offers a great depth. There are pockets as well as a zippered compartment with this purse on the inside. There is also an adjustable strap you can add to this purse to carry it on your shoulder if you don't wish to carry it. I have been using this purse for a little over 3 weeks and overall I am impressed with it. I highly recommend this purse to anybody who likes a fun, bright well made purse- And SUPER price. if you want to know more details of it you can enter the link of http://www.amazon.com/Avber-Multifunctional-Motorcycle-Shoulder Multicoloured/dp/B00V2UNB6C",5,amazon.com
8666,"It has the scent of new leather, subtle yet unmistakable. It's a patchwork of colors, to some gaudy or over the top. Rows of studs decorate the sides while in front is a can't miss glimmering skull with rays of alternating studs and rhinestones radiating outward. Soft, padded lambskin handles cushion the weight of a heavy bag. An shoulder strap, attachable to two large metal rings, is included as an option for those who prefer to carry a bag on the shoulder. On the outside of the bag is a zippered compartment large enough for some cell phones or a set of keys. In the bag's interior is another zippered compartment larger and deeper than the one on the exterior. Also in the interior are two slip in compartments with soft lining. Speaking of lining, it is not fastened to the bottom of the bag so can be pulled out enough for easy cleaning or shaking. The main compartment of the flat bottomed bag is secured via zipper with a large, easy to grasp leather fob. Now for the obvious. This can't-help- but-notice bag is not for everyone. Some will be put off by the kaleidoscope of bright colors. Others won't care for the grinning, metal skull or the excess of glam. Some women have told me they would like this bag were it made with more muted colors or less glam. Some, however, will find the bag perfect for their tastes, like a former coworker of mine who loved anything with skulls. Note - The colors in the listing photos of this bag don't match the colors on the bag next to me as I type this. So perhaps colors will vary on these bags.

Good prices, get to read reviews easily before buying and if you buy something that didn't come to your expectation they give you no drama about it. Transactions and returns are so smooth! In 4 years I haven't had to call until last week when. I continued with an order not remembering I didn't have enough on my card I called quickly to see if I could cancel it before having it go through and getting an overdraft (wasn't expecting much or had much hope since I had already made the order) but.. they responded quick and canceled it quick and smoothly. Next day I went to my bank to deposit and ask for a statement. Everything was great! Then continued my order :)  This site to me is just perfect. And I absolutely love it!!",5,amazon.com

8682,99 percent of the time I am happy with the product but when I am NOT they always give a refund even for shipping I have always shop with Amazon since their infancy and will continue to do so,5,amazon.com
8683,"The only reason I would not continue to shop with Amazon is because I feel guilty that I have abandoned my local brick and mortal shops. That was until I spoke with an employee of Amazon. She was very kind and it made me feel good that I was helping a fellow American with my purchase. What can I say? I have been shopping on Amazon for more than two years. I think there were only three times that I did not like the product I received. However, because these sellers earn stars for customer service, whatever problems I encountered were handled fast and to my satisfaction. If I needed money returned that happened. If I needed to exchange a product that happened. Once even, I was told to keep the erroneous product and still I received the replacement at no extra charge. They didn't send me some funky email asking if they could send me back half the price I spent like that Zulliy did. I have become a fan of Amazon because of my shopping experience. I have purchased lots of books, a few camera batteries, an adapter that converts my Blue Ray Disc player into RCA components. I really like the Streaming Movies on Amazon, too. I tried Amazon Prime by accident one time and they quickly stopped the subscription and refunded my account. I really love the streaming movies. If I can't find a streaming movie on Netflix (which was often), I was usually always able to find it streaming on Amazon. Sometimes I would rent the movie, which was great because they gave me weeks to watch it. I could watch my Amazon movie on my laptop, my smartphone, my tablet, Roku box and my Blue Ray Disc (when I connected it to wi-fi). Amazon is my new shopping buddy. I still however, enjoy going to my local merchants and making purchases, but if the price is too high, I do and have gone back to Amazon and have been pleasantly surprised.",5,amazon.com

8690,"Let's face it, there are lots of places online these days you can shop. However, the best place is still this oldie but goodie, Amazon.com. Basically if it is out there chances are you can find it at Amazon.com. Amazon hosts several marketplace vendors as well, so you can compare prices and find what you need. It's my favorite place to shop online.",5,amazon.com

8694,I did most of my Christmas shopping here last yr. I hate fighting the crowds in the stores.,5,amazon.com
8695,"I have been making purchases on Amazon for about 20 years now. I have never had a bad experience. I have purchased things that I had to return. Amazon has always promptly refunded my money or replaced my item. Sometimes things aren't exactly as advertised or pictured, but there are hundreds and hundreds of sellers and there is no way Amazon could keep up with every item. Because of this, they stand behind the products being sold on their site. Most sellers are great about receiving returns, but they may not accept returns for free and sometimes they add an additional re-stocking fee, so always be aware to check their return policy and re-stocking fees. Amazon promises that if you buy something from a seller and you don't get treated right, they will stand behind your purchase. I love Amazon's fast shipping service and their customer service. They have always been happy to assist me on the few times I have contacted them for help. I can count on Amazon to supply me with what I need and the service is the fastest of any other online store that I am aware of. You can find virtually everything. Additionally, Amazon Prime costs $99 per year which gives you 2 day free shipping and you also get Amazon Prime Instant Video. This is somewhat like Netflix, in addition to their many free prime movies and TV shows, you have the option to make video purchases similar to Vudu or CinemaNow. Amazon Prime member benefits allow you to share this service with up to 5 members of your household. So, if $99 seems a little steep, find a family member or 5 to share the expense. All you have to do add their email and dob to get them signed onto your prime account. No need to worry, they don't use your account. They can use their current account or create a new one and use their own payment method, but they can share in your benefits. I share my Prime membership with my son, we each pay $50 per year.",5,amazon.com
8696,"There is almost nothing I buy online that doesn't begin with a visit to the Amazon website. If it's not available there, then I will visit other sites. I am a very infrequent returner of purchases, but when I do, Amazon's rapid response is phenomenal and I have never been questioned about the reason(s) for the return. In a word, I am addicted to Amazon.",5,amazon.com

8708,"One thing I like are fun , bright, different style handbags and purses. Most would say I collect them. When I came across this Avber Floral bag there was no way I could pass it by not only because it is so different ( have never seen another like it) but they 3 colors it comes in Mint green, pink or white. I went with the mint green as I have non other in that shade.The handbag was provided to me as a sample for evaluation. I did not promise to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest, unbiased review When it came in the mail it came in a pink storage bag which was awesome so while storing it when not using I wont have to worry about it getting messed up or dirty. I took it out of the pink storage back and Oh my the color is so true to the pink a very nice mint green. The feel of the faux leather is so soft. Every thing from the handbag to the flowers on the front are made from it.The handbag is 12.6 x 5.9 x 10.6 inches and perfect for everything you need to carry from your wallet, phone, even an ipad or tablet will fit nicely in it.The handbag comes with a strap that is the same color and material as the bag & that you can attach very easily to the gold hardware on the bag. The handbag/purse has heavy gold hardware for a handle that is engraved and also has 5 crystal like gems on each side, loop to attach the strap, also on the strap to attach and the oval snap to open and close. Once you open the purse it is lined with a chocolate brown fabric.You have a small zipper pocket, a smaller compartment , another larger zipper pocket, and a VERY large compartment along with 2 pockets that are lined with the mint green leather which is the perfect size for your glasses & phone. This case ls absolutely beautiful. Much better than I expected. If you have doubts, don't have them anymore. It is everything you could want in a case, and it is very stylish.

8724,"I got the Motorola Moto E LTE(2nd gen) 2015 model to replace my aging Samsung Galaxy S2. I had the S2 for quite a while now and never really thought about upgrading until files would sometimes become corrupted and undeleteable, wifi connection would be finicky half the time, sometimes my carrier wouldn't be detected or connectable to, call quality with the onboard mic/speaker was poor(Bluetooth headsets do not have this problem) but most irritating of all most apps would take 4-8 seconds to start up no matter what I did to optimize the android system. After seeing all the fancy models coming out I decided I needed an upgrade. I mainly chose the new 2015 Moto E due to press provided by reviews on YouTube and online. I was made aware of its pros and cons from the very start. I new it wasn't gonna be like these new flagships raging all over the news, but I didn't need it to be. I wanted a simple yet stable platform for simple tasks like youtube, we surfing, calls/texts and email. Something that started applications quickly, was stable and affordable. I just got the phone today and it came in a tiny box, much smaller than what I saw some of the reviewers received. It contained the phone, a QuickStart guide, a Motorola specs and warranty booklet and a micro usb charger. Start up was very easy. I just plugged in my sim and SD card, connected to my wifi network and then logged into my Google account. Everything just synced right up. (IMPORTANT NOTE: it is not necessary to have a google account or use a wifi network. The phone will work just fine for calls with just the SIM card.) The interface and experience of the phone is WAAAAY better than my previous phone. Apps start up right away, navigating between app drawer and home screen is a lot faster, no more lag! I'm so happy. The feel of the phone is very solid, no rattles or creaks noted. The back has a nice matte finish. It weighs just as much as my Galaxy S2, which isn't a lot. I'll take some photos and post them here. The phones are equal length and width, but the Moto E is definitely thicker overall. The E despite its thicker body, feel better in the hand due to the gentle curvature of the edges. Thus allowing your fingers to better ""wrap around"" when reaching or swiping on the screen. Screen sizes are about the same with the Android buttons being onscreen on the Moto E vs on the bezel with the Galaxy. Looking closely, the screen of the MOTO E is a bit sharper, while the S2 has a slight blue tinge to it. This review feels a bit long winded and I hope it helps someone.",5,amazon.com

I can wear a tank top or a big jacket and I can still have this over my shoulder. The bag itself is not very structured, so it all depends on your personal preference and style, but I really like it. It even comes with a duster bag like my higher end purses. I would say that, for the money, this is a great choice. Better than a lot of the bags I see at TJ Maxx!

8790,One of the few websites that actually let you criticize their products and service. But if you sell on their website they are not very forgiving.

I ought to order a lot of stuff from here a lot of typically. worth|the worth|the value} was retail price tho' however that is as a result of its composition and really exhausting to search out regionally. provide and demand at work. i used to be observing burr grinders for a brand new occasional machine and located thereforeme smart costs so i'd order one in every of those. i am unable to believe I waited ciao to order from this website. i assume i'm simply to a small degree weary of recent places to buy.,5,amazon.com
8794,"In all the years I've been shopping online, Amazon has ALWAYS been, in EVERY instance, completely astounding in every aspect of their services. Their pricing is often excellent, usually only being undercut by promo discounts from sites such as Newegg, MicroCenter, etc, but with free 2-day Prime shipping, it's almost always the clear winner. Their customer service is extremely helpful, and available by phone, email, or my personal favorite, by online chat. The chat option has saved me on multiple occasions where I am at a location where I cannot answer the phone, but need help immediately. Finally, with the abundance of extra features on the site such as immediate links to SquareTrade and other warranty and protection services, order price updates and price changes based on their own advertised prices, there's nowhere I'd rather shop.  The only thing I'd like to see, if possible, would be price matching versus other comparable websites, and more Prime shipping options. Other than that, keep doing what you do, Amazon.

8800,"I admit I have strayed from the herd and tried to get deals from some Chinese companies, Aliexpress and DHGate. Lured by very low prices, well it is all a mirage, I am back shopping with Amazon.com, where you may experience some small problems that are legitimate and annoying but you really appreciate how small they are after you have been robbed by the Chinese versions of Amazon who advertize such low prices. How do they do it? well they either never have any intention of shipping anything to you in the first place, that cuts down on over head and significantly improves their profit margin. or if they do ship something it is absolute garbage, this cost them nothing but postage and helps take some stress off China's already overburdened garbage facilities also referred to as factories Then their already a joke of customer service completely disappears. Unlike over 99 percent of Aliexpresses and DHGates client base who have never been to China I have , A couple of years ago I spent two months there in the cesspool they like to call China, where the quality of the air is slightly better than the quality of what they produce and the air today in Beijing was Chunky style! What was I thinking ? That in two years a country in the world with the worst quality control has all of a sudden in 2 years straightened all their problems out? So I appreciate Amazon.com again this is partly review of the service excellence we have gotten spoiled by and come to expect over the years but the majority of it is just trashing the Chinese upstarts that have tried but failed to mimic what Amazon does. BTW I am a Canadian shopper but we tend to use Amazon.com for the better selection and much better prices and shipping so quick! How do they do it? sometimes if I purchase something on Amazon.ca and I know that the Canadian Postal System is going to get it's grubby little paws on it I just go ahead and put it in my will, I know although i am still young I will never see it so I hope a niece or a nephew might enjoy it someday it would be nice if Amazon.com sent a team to Amazon.ca and showed them just a little, not everything, but just a little of how online shopping and shipping works...please.",5,amazon.com

I love using the Support Chat when I must contact them as the conversation is written and makes it much easier to move to a higher level Manager if needed. I do not expect perfection, I do expect good help and a reasonable resolution to a problem when needed. I do expect good products and will not accept ""junk"". I have posted a few reviews and one I posted 5 years ago, still gets comments. The Amazon Works and I Love it. Yes, I am a Prime Member as I love the two day shipping.

But, for my Sons, well, they love that they aren't being bothered by, 'Mom is in desperate need of (you fill in the blank!)... So, no one is bothered by an emergency trip to the local Walgreens! lol I find that I am fulfilling those five items per month EVERY MONTH, and if you don't, just SKIP a month... No worries!!! YOU decide what date you want your delivery, so you don't have to worry about it coinciding with your paycheck... It's just a win/win!!! For me, it's been a life saver, and I've shared this with any one that will listen to me ~~",5,amazon.com

8936,"To say that I'm a frequent shopper at Amazon is an understatement. I've placed hundreds of orders, never once had an overall negative outcome. Any problems with a seller, delivery or order issue, Amazon has been quick to make it right. Their chat and phone customer services are just great. It's the first place I look to locate and price shop everything.",5,amazon.com

8938,I HAVE BOUGHT QUITE A LOT OF ITEMS ON LINE AT AMAZON MOSTLY GOOD PRICES GOOD PEOPLE TO DEAL WITH NEVER A PROBLEM.,5,amazon.com
8939,"The Prime membership gives two day no charge shipping on only items direct from Amazon.com or cooperating vendors as best as I can tell and those items tend to be a little higher priced than the same item from other vendors on Amazon.com which is a consideration only if they do not offer free shipping or you would order too little to qualify for the other vendor's free shipping. to at least make up part of the difference, but if you need things that are hard to find this seems to be the best place to order them because of the huge selection of vendors and merchandise.  The only caution is that if you are buying something with a promised delivery date weeks away it is probably being shipped directly from China or elsewhere in Asia and you might want to consider both whether you want to wait that long or cancel it and pay a little more to get a likely higher quality sold in the USA item. You basically gamble on quality in that situation because most orders will not be cost effective for you to pay return shipping for a refund. We came out way ahead on barbers capes but behind on some other times, so just be careful you order the right thing from the beginning. Realize too that on some items, like used books, that don't qualify for free shipping that they may be not price competitive with even local purchase once shipping is added. A lot of 1 cent paperback books for example come with $3.99 for shipping. Never stake your job or your life on Amazon's Prime 2 day shipping to arrive on time because it often does but doesn't always do so and the shipper has until 8 p.m. to make delivery on the promised day, well after work hours if a business with no set arrangements with the carrier for delivery only during business hours. Also if you send the shipment to an extended services U. S. Postal Service location be aware that they may not have the item available for you until the day after delivery, especially with later in the day deliveries and Amazon locket locations may not keep your delivery as long as your would like to get when convenient.",5,amazon.com

8945,"I have been a member for five years and not one bad experience. I have also shopped from private sellers on Amazon and it's been wonderful. All my books, electronics, and other valuables come from Amazon. Shipping is super fast, returns are easy, and to crown it all; I purchase items on other sites only after coming to Amazon to read the item's review. I won't be comparing amazon to other sites even though am an ardent Ebay shopper. Amazon, is less stress, less hassle, and the best online site. Wish their fees aren't too high on sellers though.",5,amazon.com
8946,I have been buying from Amazon.com for twelve years and have never been disappointed with items from appliances to electronics. I bought a K 40 CB antenna and Magnetic mount for my brother in law and he has only good things to say about it. We have been real pleased with the items we bought for our Kitchen Aid Mixer. It seems you can find most things you want at Amazon.,5,amazon.com
8947,For the last 5 years I have used this as a price check tool with great success. It is the best price comparison tool.  I also purchased many many items with great success with out a single issue. Sometime the shipping cost is advertised as free but when you order it changes to a fee. But you're in control since you have a option not to finalize the transaction at the very end. However be aware your purchase history is monitored and shared in the background.  Just like other many other website monitored by the government and other sstatistically oriented consumer company's.  Returns are average . Plea be aware there may independent sellers on Amazon that have different policies and so your experience can vary.  I'm general amazon policy are clear. This site is safe in general from hackers and scam artist and this made me come back every time.  So far I recommend this e market . Easy to use and always accepting pay pal payment.,5,amazon.com

8954,"The best part about Amazon is their return policy. When something goes wrong, they pay shipping both ways. I have returned items and received my refund before the UPS driver picked up the package. Their customer service is knowledgeable and understanding. Their Prime 2 day shipping is fantastic. I do a lot of business with amazon and not only are they price competitive, but get the merchandise to your front door very quickly.",5,amazon.com
8955,I am a college student and have been purchasing all my textbooks through amazon books. Prices are half of what the Campus book stores ask and I receive that within 10 days or less at standard shipping rates. Most times I get free shipping through Student-Prime. Check into it! Steve,5,amazon.com
8956,"I thought of Amazon as the huge online book seller for years and had noticed that they had begun to add more stuff. I always have been a Walmart shopper, since Sam Walton was alive. Most of you won't remember this but ""Sam"", that is what everyone called him, Sam would really promote one thing over price and convenience and anything else, and that was ""Made in America"" Walmart was built on the sales of Made in America, but almost immediately after the death of the patriarch of the Walton family, that mantra changed to "" Made anywhere but America"", then it changed again to ""Only Made In China"". I understand that this is a global economy, I get that, but; without wage earners making stuff here in America, there won't be an American economy. Our economy will be totally dependent on the economy of China, which is by the way still a Communist country. Well, anyway Amazon has exploded into this giant powerhouse of a marketer over the last eight years, and their Amazon Prime, with the next day shipping is amazing. I no longer go to the Walmart to pick up the odd item, I just go online and order it from Amazon, and in a day or two, there it is at my front door. I was in my local Walmart today, because my grandson needed some construction paper for a project, and could not help but notice, the shelves were depleted and the store was in disarray.  Many of the shelves were empty and the store did not look as clean as it used to. Who knows the reason... and maybe the floors at Amazon are just as dirty, and the shelves are just as empty, but when I need something, click the mouse, the screen says in stock, and boom it is on it's way. I don't have to drive down to the store, find a place to park, then battle the people in the crowded aisles only to find the item I desperately needed was out of stock. So I will continue to use Amazon, more frequently and watch for the drone to deliver my groceries in the future. OldPapaJerry",5,amazon.com

For me, good service is worth some extra money and in my experience, few companies out there match the service provided by Amazon. Easy to use, easy to resolve issues and they actually care. Amazon is my first stop for shopping online and they are typically my only stop.",5,amazon.com
9084,"have only good things to say. they have EVERYTHING, and very reasonable prices.",5,amazon.com
9085,Pay the money and get Amazon Prime (AP) it is worth it and worth changing your shopping habits to take advantage of free shipping. Most of time it is not worth buying online because the shipping charges eat up all the savings. This dynamic is changed with AP. Now you can buy a $3 item and save your gas and time to go looking for it...AND you get Amazon's version of Netflix at no additional charge! You can either keep your Netflix and have access to even more movies online or just go with the Amazon service and save money. I have kids so all of us use it and this multiples the savings and convenience.,5,amazon.com
9086,I have never had a bad experience except that a order did not arrive in time for Christmas and I paid for it to. However they did refund my shipping amount but they had said they would give you a $25 gift certificate but I did not receive it. I was pleased to receive the refund of my shipping. Other than that I love Amazon.,5,amazon.com

But, Amazon stands behind everything and I've always gotten a replacement or a refund with absolutely no problem from Amazon. In the last six months I've placed more than 105 orders with Amazon. I am a shutin so I get all my groceries from Prime Pantry. Merchants who use Prime shipping add to the price to make up for it but it still comes in two days.",5,amazon.com

9125,Did you know that when you go to smile.amazon.com and name your favorite charity that Amazon will contribute to that charity every time you make a purchase? Not many people do. I try to spread the word by sending notifications on my FB page when I make a purchase. It is so easy to do. Just type in your browser smile.amazon com instead of Amazon.com and make a difference in the lives of others. Ask yourself what other company does this for others? None that I know of. Way to go Amazon! You make my shopping experience even better every time I make a purchase. Remember .....smile.amazon.com. You can help to make a difference!,5,amazon.com
9126,not sure why anyone would try Aliexpress...,5,amazon.com
9127,"Whatever u want its on amazon!! But contacting the customer support is a bit problematic , the information is hidden in some complex path on their site. Also for many products the tracking information is not available on their page with the order information. After roaming here and there and going through some unknown paths had to find out the tracking information. It should be upfront available.",5,amazon.com
9128,"Hard to imagine anyone hasn't shopped online at Amazon.com because they have almost EVERYTHING there. I have made hundreds of purchases at Amazon and never had a disappointment of any significance.  I go to Amazon first when shopping for anything. Its unusual for me to not find several choices of whatever it is I am looking for. Its helpful to have a record of all my online purchases in one place and Amazon makes returns easy. There return policy is limited to 30 days, but if you have any problem at all with a product, they pay for the shipping by sending you a return postage stamp. If your return is your fault, you must pay the return shipping. All of this can be done online, but if you need to speak with someone you can do so via chat, email or a phone call. My experience has been that their customer service reps are excellent... well trained, proactive, considerate, and clearly ""on your side"".  I am a Amazon Prime member, which means I pay about $80 a year to get free two-day shipping on my purchases. Not all products are available for Prime, but its been rare for me to pay shipping and I almost always enjoy my purchases in two days or less. Prime also provides other perks, like thousands of streaming videos and TV shows, free music downloads, and free Kindle books. I have been a Prime member for several years and its well worth it for me BECAUSE I AM A FREQUENT SHOPPER. Amazon has a robust review system. Many items have hundreds of reviews and Amazon uses a ""verified buyer"" system to help you validate what you're seeing. Its easy to sort and read through their reviews.  I ALMOST gave Amazon a 4 and not a 5 is because sometimes their prices are way notably higher than other places, even when compensating for the free shipping. Sometimes their prices are less than other smaller boutiques or stores, but the vast majority of the time they are comparable. After looking at the summary below where I gave them five stars in 4 of 5 categories, I figured a 5 would best represent my overall experience. For me, the value Amazon provides is worth an extra few dollars every now and then. I know they will stand behind my purchases, that customer service will be accessible and of high quality (this is critical to me as a customer experience professional), that I will get my stuff when its promised, and that it will be easy to track my purchases down the line.  Do beware that other sellers use Amazon to sell. I have done so myself and they have a strong system to enforce quality control. With that said, I am always careful to determine whether I am buying from Amazon, an Amazon re-seller or another entity all together. Some re-sellers have their own return and shipping policies, so be sure to check this out. I tend to stick with the sellers backed by Amazon's policies, however, on many occasions I have used other re-sellers and have never had a problem.",5,amazon.com

The only thing I wish is that when you are looking for things you could sort the ones that come up in a price order. The service is great if you have a problem with a seller. Shipping is fine. Depends on where and who you buy through. I am still on the fence about Amazon Prime. i guess if you buys a ton of stuff this is great.

The companion app is a great feature too and I use it often. My only downside is the small piece of my soul that disappears when I use the app in a shop. I pick up something I want, scan the barcode with the app, buy it cheaper on Amazon and make my contribution to closing down the high street. I wish I could buy more in the shops but Amazon is just so convenient and great value for money. I've also had brilliant and fast customer service when an order (rarely) goes wrong.",5,amazon.com

I do 80% of all my birthday and Christmas shopping through Amazon, because it is so convenient. I buy clothes all the time through Amazon, and unlike my other review for dresslily - they have Hasselfree returns. During Christmas, we purchased a planer for a gift and upon arrival saw it was much smaller than what the picture seemed to show. We laughed, because we couldn't believe anyone would be able to write plans in a book so small, and the price was crazy for a book of blank pages so tiny. So we filed for a return. Amazon quickly refunded or money, and told us to keep the tiny little planer. It was so easy, and has been everytime I have needed to do a return- which really hasn't been that often. If you have been living under a rock and have never shopped with Amazon -What are you waiting for. Life is easy with Amazon ' s selection and 2 day shipping. OH! ... And they have books and movies tv shows that you can watch if you get the Amazon Prime. Amazon really truly is my favorite store to shop at.",5,amazon.com

Since I've gotten Prime I have (no exaggeration) ordered over 30 orders within those 6 months. 2 days FREE shipping. It's a win. If you're against all things Prime then that's okay too. They have wishlists so you can save items and so that people can buy them for you. Hint hint to people who are hard to buy for. And even though it's from different sellers 90% of the time I can find something on amazon for way cheaper than any store is selling it for.

9401,mostly good,5,amazon.com
9402,Always Great!,5,amazon.com
9403,"I can't tell you enough great things about Amazon, especially in the Books/Education Category. They are beyond wonderful! You have the option of buying books new or used, and they are priced accordingly. They seem to have contacts with quite a few businesses and people with books they are selling, available through Amazon. I would caution you, however, that just because someone is charging only $3.99 for an item, does not mean that is how much you will end up paying. You will pay the listed amount PLUS how much they charge for THEIR Shipping and Handling Fee. Sometimes if you mailed a small book, it might cost you under $5.00 if you mailed it from the Post Office. For the exact same item, they often charge whatever they feel like charging, which means they could set their Shipping and Handling Charges as $39.95 for the same item. Add their ""Fees"" to what they stated was the price. Instead of the item costing only $3.99 plus tax, you might have to pay over $45.00. Sometimes if the Amazon book price is listed as $20.00, often with FREE Shipping, you can save a lot of money just to buy books ""New"" from Amazon. Amazon is one of my favorite online buying resources.",5,amazon.com
9404,If you want to find something that is not often in a brick and mortar store this is the place. The website is easy to use and much of the product is priced lower than what you can find it in most stores. I use it all the time for everything from vitamins to plasma televisions.,5,amazon.com
9405,Very good service!,5,amazon.com
9406,"Every time I shop with Amazon they seem to get better and they have also been amazingly responsive on queries even when they are a bit complicated (misleading product description rapidly resolve, Amazon affiliates application wrongly rejected, etc.) Great service, a key site for me.",5,amazon.com

9415,LOVE AMAZON,5,amazon.com
9416,"I purchase heaps of little things from Amazon, and have purchased over many years. Their customer product review system which allows buyers to write reviews and update them as time goes by is the main reason I use Amazon. I can research the quality and experiences of other buyers in a way that cannot be done on any other site I know of. I have made one customer service request and was blown away by the immediate response and rectification. They ship quickly as do their related suppliers. I pay for Prime membership and the freebies that come with that membership are well worth the subscription. Amazon is the greatest!",5,amazon.com

9427,"I spent multiple thousand of dollars purchasing stuff for me, family and relatives with zero worries, I have done it, doing it and will continue to do it without hesitation. Amazon do respect their clients, care about them extremely, professionally and carefully for this reason they have built a very solid and unshakable base of loyalty among both local and global customers. I do recommend it for everyone especially international buyers, Amazon is a no brainer choice.",5,amazon.com
9428,"Amazon.com is my go to site when I've looked everywhere else. They also rate themselves aggressively so they maynot respond to sitejabber. They are good at customer service and work hard to rectify problems. It takes a while to find out how to contact them, but once you figure it out, you are good to go. All my shipments are quick and I've not had to send anything back. I had a easy time cancelling a subscribe and save (which is automatic shipments). My dogs loved a special treat and it was ONLY available on amazon.com. By finally placing it on subscribe and save I knew I'd have it. My first furbuddy died in February 2013 and my second November 2014, thus I had no need of this special treat shipping again. My new pup is not into treats. Amazon was more than understanding about cancelling any future orders. I just remembered they overbilled me once on these treats and were quick to just cancel the bill and have the vendor fix the site with the incorrect price. They are a hard company to beat whether they make any money or not. They keep the customer front and center.",5,amazon.com
9429,"While I have had a few complaints over the years, Amazon has come through to help resolve my issues via their excellent customer service. A couple of times, I had ordered items through their Amazon Warehouse Deals program that were not as described, and they either offered a refund, or a replacement. As for pricing, they are not always the lowest price, but if it is a larger purchase, watch Amazon daily as the price tends to change often. (Add it to your cart, and your cart will notify you of changes.) One issue I have is with shipping--some packages arrive with the USPS doing the ""last mile"" of delivery, and I do not like the loss of tracking information, especially with the rash of package thefts in our area. Overall though, I've had great experiences with customer service, and that makes a difference as to whether or not I continue doing business with them.",5,amazon.com
9430,"I shop for almost everything from Amazon!! I've never had a bad experience there. One time I didn't get my item, they asked no questions, resent it out again right away, one time I had gotten socks, it had a hole, they didn't want to see them or have me send them back, sent out free socks!! They have amazing sellers on there.. Plus I like they carry everything!!! I buy everything except clothes, I will get a sweat shirt here and there..",5,amazon.com
9431,Always received good products from Amazon. No billing issues & no shipping issues. You can find pretty much anything. They also work with my credit card for easy use of using my reward points which makes check out so easy!,5,amazon.com
9432,"I found some amazing deals on Amazon, from household items to personal items. I am a frequent shopper and love the Amazon Local deals as well.",5,amazon.com
9433,"Yes, they have almost everything. The reviews are the best part for me - crowdsourcing the item's description, with so much more info than the manufacturer has. Be aware that many of the items are not sold by Amazon, but by affiliates - Amazon collects your info and money, and the affiliate ships it out (or Amazon ships for them). If yo find something and the price looks a little high - search again. Many times the same product is listed in different places, by different sellers, and they can vary quite widely in price.",5,amazon.com
9434,"I love to order from Amazon.com. I have always had great shopping and returning experiences. There is no better way to shop! And now you can sign up with Smile.amazon.com and have a percentage of your purchase go to your favorite charity. Thanks Amazon!

9437,I have ordered from Amazon.com numerous times over the years and have never had an issue. Everything is always shipped promptly and I have always received just what I ordered. I will continue to shop with Amazon.com.,5,amazon.com
9438,"This is another site to which I return time and time again. If anyone is a model for service and shipping, it is Amazon. They've been around for years and for good reason. They have warehouses all over the US and their shipping rates are phenomenal, especially if you bite the bullet and purchase the Prime membership. I thought the $99 for the new Prime was too much, but after paying for the shipping on just a few items, I went right back to the Prime. You will spend more than $100 for shipping if you don't have it. You will also wait weeks for some things and I am not a patient person. The fringe benefits are also amazing. I love Amazon.",5,amazon.com
9439,"I have been seeing a lot of hate on amazon lately, and I must say, myself, the issues I have had , didn't come from Amazon, but from other people who I have ordered off of through amazon. Here is the deal. If you order add-on items you might lose money compared to if you just bought it regularly. I have also had a few problems ordering items, and they didn't say where they were coming from, to realize they were coming from China. Doesn't bother me as long as I get the item. I just wish it didn't still say 3-5 days if it will be 2 weeks. All in all, I have ordered a lot of stuff from Amazon and I have gotten every order and they were here on time (unless from someone else or China).",5,amazon.com

My only complaint is that they're associated with the terrible, horrible, no-good, very-bad Woot.com. Amazon needs to do itself a favor and cut loose from that swindling company.",5,amazon.com
9443,INCREDIBLE how such a big company can offer such amazing service even when something goes wrong over the busy holiday season. Thank you Amazon. You rock!,5,amazon.com
9444,"I often order with amazon and so far I never had issues. Their global shipping is very fast. Customer service is great, they take their time to help you and they help you choosing the right product for you if you need their help for that. I just regret that with international shipping there are a lot of restrictions and I am disappointed that I cannot order everything from them",5,amazon.com
9445,"These guys are really top notch! I had a shipment go missing and never make it to my doorstep. The value of the product was around one hundred dollars and I wanted to know what happened to it. I went to my account, opened up live chat, and (unexpectedly) had a free replacement on its way within ten minutes. Cannot stress enough how much I appreciate the polite and helpful service provided by Amazon. I will continue to be a loyal customer for many years to come.",5,amazon.com

9448,"I love Amazon! Now when I want to purchase stuff in stores, I check on Amazon to see if there's a better price and I usually find a better price. Their prices can change for the better or worse - typically better. Customer service is great! I never had an issue with them. I have had issues with other things but they fix it right away. Amazon goes above and beyond to keep (most of) their customers happy. Some items offer free returns while some items do not. You usually have to pay for shipping for returns if you simply don't like the product. If there's any issues with the product, you can usually return it for no charge. Their fast shipping pretty much spoils me. When I purchase items from other websites, they usually take at least a week but it feels like forever.",5,amazon.com
9449,"Since discovering the full potential of Amazon four years ago, I do most of my shopping through their website -- even going as far as to order dog and cat food. I especially love purchasing Christmas presents through them as I hate the holiday rush at stores.  The few times that I have had a problem with items not being shipping on time, etc, I have received excellent customer service and the problems have always been addressed promptly and satisfactorily.  There's only been one time where I received damaged merchandise (as everything is usually packaged quite well) and Amazon immediately refunded my money and paid for me to ship the product back to them.",5,amazon.com

9466,I ordered a lund truck cover and am so happy with it. The first one I ordered was the wrong size and they promptly sent a shipper out and picked it up and sent a new one. Ouch. That shipping must have been expensive. This is a big item. But Amazon stood by its customer.,5,amazon.com

Though, they charge you for selling an item, you get the money for shipping as well. You can write reviews on items as well. That's about it.",5,amazon.com
9470,"You know how you open a browser window to search for an item you want to buy? Amazon will always be the result I click on. It's my go-to for almost anything I want at a good price. Their review system is extremely helpful, because you can quickly can see if a seller is reputable or not, and if the product is legit, how it works, etc. I love the layout. Can't say anything about their returns, because I've never had to return anything. Can't speak enough to the great shipping speed of amazon fulfilled items, and don't get me started on Prime. You normally couldn't get me to pay an extra dime to be part of a special savings club. But after testing Prime and seeing the extremely fast shipping times, it's on my to-do list to sign up for Prime. So worth it. Great websites deserve great ratings and I'm giving this one 5 shiny stars.",5,amazon.com

Then, make sure to copy the name & model # and paste it to the search at Amazon.com. Everything's a lot cheaper that way! Amazon also has one of the BEST return polices. Free Shipping for orders over $35. For maybe a couple of dollars more they ship it faster. Amazon also has a lot of items I would have spent more money on at WalMart, lots!",5,amazon.com

9474,"Ive never owned an apple slicer.until now! And boy I had no idea what I was missing out on. The Apple Slicer plus free garlic peeler is the bomb digty bomb! My kids and I had a blast using it to slice and core our apples. Its super fast and easy. Just stand the apple up, put the apple slicer on top of the apple and push down. And waaalllllaaaa, your apples are sliced and de-cored. Brilliant! You will need to push down with a little force, (the handles are sturdy and comfortable to grab on to), and keep in mind the blades are super sharp, so once you get started the apple has no chance. I used a curved paper plate, so I turned my slicer upside down and just poked out the slices and core. Rinsed it off and stored it in the nice bag it came with. How cool is this! This is a must have kitchen gadget. My kids had fun using it to cut their apples, (by the way, I had no arguing over who was getting a bigger slice of apple since this cuts evenly) and I had fun cutting my work in half! If there was anything Id change about this product it would be to include directions. The free garlic peeler that came with this; I have not used yet since I am not sure how to use this product. After testing this product, its awesome and this apple slicer belongs in every kitchen, especially if you like apples.",5,amazon.com

9488,"I have ordered an inordinate amount from Amazon. Everything has been delivered on time and if I had any problems with the merchandise, Amazon Customer Service was always great. Unlike some other websites, Amazon solicits honest customer feedback and they publish the good along with the not-so-good. I find it a slap in the face for online merchants to publish only the good reviews because it is so unfair to people who want to read the good and the bad so they can make informed decisions.",5,amazon.com

9492,"I ordered from Amazon 76 times in the past 4 years. I purchased all kinds of stuff - electronics (computer, mouse, keyboard, headphones, webcam, bluray writer, USB flash, external HDD storage..), paper books, cosmetics, toys, shoes, accessories, jewelry and even bigger stuff like travelling luggage.  I never had any kind of problem, not even once that I would be dissatisfied. Of course there happened to be issues, e.g. the computer mouse stopped working or I didn't receive some item in a period of time (I am sure the guard stole it or the delivery man lost it), and in those cases Amazon is always on the buyer's side. You return it for a reason or ask for refund for not-delivered item. Amazon's A-Z Guarantee always resolves problems in the best way. The only thing you have to be careful about is the seller you're choosing to buy from. I am very picky and attentive in such matters, probably that's why my risk is at the minimum. Pay attention to the available photos of the product, product description, product location and certainly reviews and seller rating. And surely you must familiarize yourself with rules of Amazon before you get in the game (e.g. Shipping Address cannot be changed after the item has been marked as Shipped), but that's what you signed for when you were agreeing to Terms and Conditions!",5,amazon.com

9494,"I love, love love Amazon. If you purchase a lot through them it's worth getting Amazon Prime for the free shipping and movies. If you have a student email, you can get that half off which is prefect for ordering your textbooks and Christmas! I only had one semi bad experience on Amazon and it could have been the sellers deceit....I attempted to purchase an old video game but the seller sent me a piece of paper from the case (seriously..?) and when I checked my order again, it still showed that I was purchasing the video game. Seller issues are sometimes handled by Amazon and although this wasn't entirely the case, Amazon did refund my money. And yes, I returned the lame video game insert.  I love Amazon for the free shipping, the ease of purchasing (dangerously easy), the trust that I have that I will always get what I order, and the movies/tv shows (especially since they made that deal and now we get all the HBO shows)! Highly recommended! <3",5,amazon.com

Ordered two day shipping at Christmas time and parcel was late due to a UPS meltdown but arrived one business day late...  Prime membership is expensive but if you utilize the option to add 3 family members to your prime account (I think it is 3 or 4) and divide the amount of the membership between all, it is well worth the price and convenience of shopping online with extremely fast delivery!",5,amazon.com

Amazon features many name brand items and you can even find items which are discontinued or rare. What I like the most about Amazon instead of Ebay is that Amazon isn't a bidding site, reasonable prices are posted and when you like an item you can buy it right away, no waiting for an auction to end.

A Prime membership also gets you streaming video, and it's cheaper than Netflix, without even getting into the shipping benefits.

Really. No more than half of Amazon's inventory is in stock at one time, but they are always striving for some availability. You can tell they really want you to get what you're looking for. Only thing is, they're not so good for things that have long been out of print. If you want something like that, try Googling ""rare (insert category here).""",5,amazon.com

9549,"I have to share my recent experience with Amazon.com. I am still in shock and amazed how wonderful their Customer Service is! A month ago, I placed an order with Amazon. There were three boxes all shipped by UPS. One of the boxes, UPS delivered to the USPS for final delivery. This was the box that never arrived. I received a text from Amazon when it was delivered. But, it hadn't. It is a very long story of how bad USPS was to deal with about this ""lost"" shipment. A few days later, quite upset with USPS, I emailed Amazon. This was NOT their fault, nor was it the fault of UPS. I told them that. I was just upset I was out quite a bit of money and there was no delivery signature and I had no where else to turn for help. Within one hour (literally!), I received the nicest email from Amazon Customer Service. They credited back the money (it was ""in pending"" an hour later on my credit card account!), wanted me to re-order the items and included the links to those items in their email to me! And, if that wasn't wonderful enough, they offered me free one-day shipping for ""my inconvenience""! They also informed me that their shipping department would help locate that package with the USPS. Today, three weeks later, I received another email from Amazon Customer Service. Their shipping group received that ""delivered"" package and it was marked ""Undeliverable"" by USPS!  A negative ten points to USPS, and, to Amazon, I am your customer for life! You didn't have to reimburse me for my loss, but you did! You were also able to take on the USPS when I was ignored by them. I just had to share my story about how incredibly wonderful Amazon has treated me. I am not an Amazon Prime member. I am not one of their ""regular"" customers. I may purchase from them a few times a year. Yet, they treated me as if I was their most prized customer. THANK YOU, AMAZON!",5,amazon.com

It is no wonder that Amazon has become a common household name. I personally recommend Amazon to anyone looking for value and service in shopping for everyday and special needs.",5,amazon.com
9554,"Have been using Amazon for years, their customer support rocks, I never had a problem with them.",5,amazon.com
9555,"This is my favorite online shipping store. Here I do most of my shopping and I am very pleased with this site especially when I buy from other sites and I don't get my packages. I never had a late order or even worst ""not arrived order"" or to lose any of my packages with Amazon. I wan to thank them with this occasion for the good work. Keep up the good work Amazon.com",5,amazon.com
9556,"I started ordering from Amazon.com about 12 years ago. Amazon.com is everything a buyer could wish for. They have multiple items to cover what a person is looking for, the prices are good, and they deliver fast. It usually only takes 2-3 days from the time I place an order until I receive the shipment. I couldn't ask for any better. AND, it's so much better than having to go window shopping until you find what you're looking for and the best bargain price.",5,amazon.com
9557,"Love it! Even when they send you a product that doesn't work, they email you a postage paid envelope so you can return the item for free!",5,amazon.com
9558,Excellent website with a great user interface and very reliable feedback from user ratings and Q&A. I almost don't know how to shop in a regular bricks and mortar store without looking at an Amazon rating! It is the model online shopping experience.,5,amazon.com
9559,"I don't know anyone who has complaints about Amazon.The amazing thing is this site is huge but their costumer service is friendly and accessible. During the holidays I was busy sending gifts from Amazon.A day later I noticed that I had completely misspelled a street address. The Amazon guy fixed it for me within minutes and package received so fast, you can't beat Amazon for prices and supper fast delivery!",5,amazon.com
9560,"Excellent customer service. Bought keyboard that went wrong, they just sent me a new one, no questions asked.",5,amazon.com
9561,Great prices. Can buy alomost anything,5,amazon.com
9562,I only had l problem with Amazon and it was with a magazine order - I accidentally put in the wrong shipping address (as it was for a friend) and it took a while to get it resolved. Otherwise Amazon is AWESOME - just be sure with magazine if you order for another person you get THEIR address in there not yours.,5,amazon.com
9563,"I love this site, this is my go to if i can't find it elsewhere. I love that you get the option to either buy it new or used. I love the free shipping on eligible items. I also love that if i need to i can clean out my house of the things i don't use anymore and make some extra money. The only thing that i don't like is if i want to sell a book or a VHS tape for example, i would have to pay to sell it basically after they take out the commission. The commission is pretty high, but i know that my item is going to sell fast and there is some convenience to it. If i ever had a problem, i rely on amazon customer support to fix it. Many of the sellers have been awesome, once i bought some jewelery and it broke, so they sent out a new pair the next day. I wasn't expecting that from the seller but there are good people. If you ever have a problem on this site that can't be handled by the individual seller, then contact amazon customer service. They take very good care of their customers and ensure that everyone is happy. Make sure you read the seller reviews to get an idea on if that person is going to ship fast, or if the items are as described. Reviews are always helpful in every aspect.",5,amazon.com
9564,Always have great experiences at amazon no matter what I buy. I especially love the fact that their reviews are posted whether favourable or not. Excellent job amazon.,5,amazon.com
9565,"Always find what I need, at a great price. I am usually able to qualify for free shipping. Order status info is readily available online. I like being able to see product reviews, but realize they are subjective; at least I can see the good and the bad and decide for myself! Even if I decide to buy locally, at least I have some perspective on price. Never had a problem with an occasional return.",5,amazon.com
9566,"I love Amazon.Com. The site is very easy, the reviews are generally useful (I often consult them before purchasing anything) and their customer support has always been responsive. I've been a ""Prime"" member since they began offering it and find added value in it consistently.",5,amazon.com
9567,"No need for a lengthy review on this one. I've used Amazon for years and always have something positive to say. Great way to find things for cheap/inexpensive, you just have to wait a little longer to get it.",5,amazon.com
9568,"Creating an amazon.com account is pretty easy. I don't remember having to add a credit card number before I actually ordered anything, so that's always good. It's always good to at least skim or search though the Privacy Policy and terms of service. That way you can see how things can work out for you if something negative were to happen.  Most sellers I've bought something from were always really good, punctual, and delivered what I had expected. However there's always that lot that sucks. I tried to buy a replacement laptop battery from a seller (something like kmsbooks/kmsdbooks) and they sent me the wrong one. I contacted them, they were polite and sent me a new one. Still the wrong one. Overall, a really good site to do your shopping on, just read the reviews before you buy anything so that you are aware of what you might get.",5,amazon.com
9569,I have had nothing but excellent service from Amazon. Recently I had to return some purchased items and it was easier than I expected. They are doing a great job and often have lower prices than what's available in regular retail stores.,5,amazon.com
9570,One thing I like about this site is the vast amount of products available. They sell everything. I was able to order some sheet music from a specific author and BAM!. I should order more stuff from here more often. The price was retail price though but that's because its sheet music and very hard to find locally. Supply and demand at work. I was looking at burr grinders for a new coffee machine and found some good prices so I might order one of those. I can't believe I waited so long to order from this site. I guess I am just a bit weary of new places to shop.,5,amazon.com
9571,"Easy returns great products and usually the best prices. I can say that in the last 5 years we really were only disappointed by 2 products and they were pet products with mixed reviews when bought them, so not an Amazon fault.",5,amazon.com

9589,"I shop on Amazon so much that I swear, if I walked into one of their warehouses, they'd recognize me. I've been shopping there since their beginning, back when they only sold books, and now I can find anything in the world there, which is pretty amazing. I've never had a bad experience with Amazon, whether I'm buying directly from them, or one of their 3rd party sellers. The very few times that I haven't been happy with a product, I was able to return it for a refund with no problems whatsoever. If there was a problem with the item, they paid return shipping. If I just didn't like it, I paid the return shipping, which seems fair. Whether I'm shopping for books, toys, furnace parts, electronics, sea salt, boots, or any of a million other things, I can usually find it on Amazon at better prices than anywhere else.  Unless I'm shopping for handmade, I always check Amazon first when I'm looking for something specific. I also find it to be a great place to shop for gifts for those hard to shop for people on my list because for many products, I can narrow the search options down to gender and age. That's priceless.",5,amazon.com

I contacted customer support and was granted a free shipping label to mail back, and refunded my 100% right then and there so I could purchase a new one. ( I did not want to purchase it again, and I did not, but still was refunded) Customer support is 10 out of 5 stars. They go farther than they need to to make you happy.

9596,I use amazon for all of my needs! Shipping is always fast and amazon is an excellent distributor. I love the Amazon Student and Mom sections to help save you discounts on what you really need. I am totally in love with the wish list and am constantly updating my lists. You can use a universal wish list button for once! So add an item from ANY site and if amazon has a cheaper match it will automatically show up and recommend similar items. The perfect site to make a baby registry too! Wonderful I could not be more pleased with a site!,5,amazon.com
9597,"I have ordered enough times from Amazon, I don't want to admit to the numbers. Delivery is always as promised. One delivery was delayed by a day due to inclement weather at a UPS hub.Neither Amazon's or UPS's fault. Items are always well packed, arrive in terrific shape. The prices are hard to beat (at times they are not the cheapest, but with their track record in fulfilling my orders with quality product delivered in a timely manner, low price doesn't always win out. Fortunately, they ARE often the pricing winner, so there are no decisions to be made.",5,amazon.com
9598,"Amazon is just the best thing on earth. You can find such amazing deals that you would find on other sites as a scam. They're extremely secure with their information, and alert you on which products will be taken down if, in any way, are skeptical.  Every time I order from Amazon, my packages arrive on time, in good condition and fair priced. They have a direct line that isn't confusing and the reps help you in an orderly and timely fashion.  Amazon is just a great site. I'm sure they have their occasional mix ups but so far, with me, they've been nothing but helpful and successful.",5,amazon.com

9603,"It's been our go-to site for anything book-related for years and we're finding it useful for all sorts of other things. For instance, we found a tail light for a Toyota Prius for less than half the quote from a local mechanic. (The tail light is now in service with no problems.)  I did have one minor issue re Kindle: a magazine that they offer (and show as available for the Kindle) isn't supported on the PaperWhite. I didn't find that out until after I had purchased it and found it wouldn't download. It was easy enough to cancel, but that part of the web site needs improvement. For things non-Kindle I've never had a problem with shipping delays or other issues. Sometimes they have surprised us and the item showed up the next day when we asked (and paid for) regular shipping.  In general, Amazon keeps surprising us with what can be purchased reliably online.",5,amazon.com

9615,"You're probably familiar with Amazon.com already, but I'm specifically reviewing Amazon Prime. This is a service (requires an annual subscription) that make shipping FREE for any purchase made directly from Amazon (usually, this is lower than the competitor pricing). Additionally, Prime gets you FREE streaming for tons of movies (usually not the greatest movies out there, but some good ones). You can also get an Amazon Prime app to watch movies on your iPad. And, with Prime you can ""borrow"" many different books for free on the Kindle reader so you don't have to buy them.",5,amazon.com

9644,"I had great experience using this meat thermometer, a magical device about which many people are still unaware. This gadget looks quite simple but its results are outstanding. It can help you to become and cook like a professional chef. Just like the waiter in a restaurant asks, how would you like your meat to be? You can ask a similar question to your guests. Wouldn't that be great? Your guests will be eating a perfectly cooked meat loaf. I use this wonderful gadget while cooking all types of meat, whether it's chicken or whether its beef, you can cook everything perfectly. The basic structure of the meat thermometer consists of a Stainless steel probe that can measure upto 250 degree Celsius. This is the main role of the meat thermometer which let people like us who are fond of cooking, to cook a perfect steak or a meat loaf. I can easily insert the probe to the core of the meat and check what the exact temperature is inside. This helps me to cook the meat loaf perfectly and make my guests happy. Why this meat thermometer is better than the other ones available in the market. It has a remote receiver with it that works on 433MHz frequency and a range of 100 meters. It means that while my meat is cooking I can roam about and do my others tasks and there's no need to peep in to the BBQ or any other machines in which the meat is cooking. As soon as the meat is cooked I get an indication because only this meat thermometer is laced with an alarm and a timer. It has 6 meat settings and 4 taste settings which have made my work easier. I can take my meat thermometer to the picnics and nightouts and I can be sure that this wonderful gauge and probe combination can make your meals part a memorable one. I also bought other meat thermometers earlier but I found that their functions were quite limited. One of my friends suggested me this one and found this one with multi-functionality. I bought it from Amazon. The best feature this meat thermometer has is the wide temperature range; it can measure from -10 degree C to 250 degree C (14 to 482 deg F). Believe it or not, this meat thermometer has made my life much easier and faster than before and I recommend this wonderful gadget to every lady who wants to save her time in kitchen and also cook a perfectly cooked meat for her family and friends.",5,amazon.com

I hardly ever purchase off Ebay as I find everything I need off Amazon. Buy with confidence!!,5,amazon.com
9658,I'm a Amazon Preferred Customer (or was at least) and I've never had issues with them. Walmart is panicking and they should. Amazon is so much better to the point they should serious consider opening up micro stores at least of their own.,5,amazon.com

I can totally recommend their customer service.",5,amazon.com
9663,"Amazon is an absolutely wonderful website. Let's see...what's not to like... You can find pretty much any item on Amazon, and you won't have to pay ridiculous retail prices for it. And I must say, whether I shopped with Amazon itself, or with an Amazon seller, i've always had a great shopping experience and received my items on time and in good shape. And whenever I want to buy something, even in store, I check out its Amazon reviews. I find the reviews to be impartial and they usually give good pros and cons. Check out what people had to say for the Nook, for example. You'll find really insightful reviews that help you make the right purchasing decision. So, if you haven't shopped on Amazon yet (trust me, i recently met someone who hadn't :), then what are you waiting for? ;) Best site ever. I'll be thrilled when they launch their online grocery site!",5,amazon.com

9665,Super freaking amazing! I buy tons of items from Amazon - from Himalayan Salt Lamps to shoes and straws for reusable plastic cups. Shipping is super fast and free since I have a Prime account. I've saved tons on shipping alone with Prime and the upgrade to next day air is so cheap I've upgraded several deliveries to next day delivery. Returns are a breeze and I personally love that there are tons of reliable reviews on each product and also on sellers.,5,amazon.com
9666,This is probably my favorite freaking site on the net! I spend as much money at Amazon as I probably at my local WalMart.Their prices are tough to beat and you get free shipping for all orders over $25.,5,amazon.com

9669,"Best site ever for books and other media. I am a Prime member now, totally worth it to be able to order items and get them in 2 days with free shipping. I love my Kindle fire HD also, so much better than my old ipad. Amazon has excellent customer service and you can call them! I always check prices and products on Amazon now before buying. Their phone app is marvelous also.",5,amazon.com
9670,"Amazon seems to have been around forever. About a month ago I bought a used book. Great price, great book and no problems at all. I used Amazon some years ago and it did not go so well. However, my recent experience I can highly rate. They really seemed to have improved how they do things which is great for someone like me who would prefer to get good deals on old stuff.",5,amazon.com
9671,I just love Amazon - they always have everything that I am looking for and often beat the ebst prices that I can find when comparing with other sites - excellent shipping rates & times! Mega time saver!!,5,amazon.com
9672,Best customer service. Most reputable and highest quality online retailer in the United States. Period.,5,amazon.com
9673,"Amazon.com is the Internet's most trusted and reliable department store. It's great not only for purchasing products and product research, but is also an effective place to conduct research on all types of topics. Started as an online bookstore in Jeff Bezos' Bellevue, WA garage in 1995, when online stores of any kind were rare and novel, Amazon.com has become much more than merely the top place to shop for nearly anything. Amazon.com has become a full-blown Internet portal to compete with Yahoo!, Microsoft and Google, offering account holders for free in many cases many cloud storage and processing services, as well as spawning or acquiring a diverse set of other, non-flagship online properties. Many don't know Amazon has owned the popular and indispensable Internet Movie Database (imdb.com) since 1998. They run alexa.com, providers of information about web traffic. Amazon Mechanical Turk (mturk.com), wihose slogan ""Artificial Artificial Intelligence"" always gets a light chuckle from me, is a great place to make a little extra cash or find some humans to do tasks online that only humans can do. Zappos.com is a repackaging of their shoe and shoe-related offerings. And in 2013 Amazon.com gobbled up goodreads.com, a book lover's social networking site. I'm sure they're not perfect, but speaking only for myself I have ordered many kinds items here and thee through the years and I have never had a problem. Most recently I ordered my first 64-bit system in many different pieces and orders through them and all the parts have shown up on time or early and all the parts were what they were supposed to be, as, dealing with a firm as well-known and established as Amazon is, I expected them to be.",5,amazon.com
9674,Always excellent service. Always great prices. No wonder they are the worlds biggest online retailer! One click checkout is super convenient!,5,amazon.com
9675,I order everything from books to cosmetics to coffee from Amazon and am never concerned about delivery. A few times I ordered on Sunday and had my stuff delivered by Monday!! Who does that? :) Love your site and what you offer.,5,amazon.com
9676,"I recently purchased an item from Amazon and never received the product. Within days of submitting a complaint, Amazon had refunded my money! This may be the only site I'm no afraid to use!",5,amazon.com
9677,I looooooooove this site! I go there for one book and they recommend so many others I always end up buying at least 3! But I might get a kindle soon to solve this problem :),5,amazon.com
9678,"Love this website. Yes, not all the price is cheaper but if you know what do you need and market price, you'll save time, money, energy on Amazon. Prime member really pays off. Customer service is great.",5,amazon.com
9679,I cannot say enough good things about this site! If you have not yet visited or purchased anything I would recommend doing so immediately. Any product you could imagine is sold here and with various pricing options as well as delivery options the saving can be tremendous. If you often order things online I would highly encourage paying the extra to sign up for Prime membership (free 2-day shipping) or even waiting until they have a free trial (they often do).,5,amazon.com
9680,"Cannot say enough about Amazon. Their customer service is A++++. Every time I have an issue, they resolve it. They keep customers happy and happy customers keep coming back.  I do A LOT of purchases online and I always go to Amazon first. I am a prime member and it's worth the money. THANK YOU AMAZON for being so consistent in your customer service. I love you guys!",5,amazon.com

9682,"Everything I have ever ordered from Amazon has been a great experience. No issues on getting orders on time. I ordered a Kindle Fire in 2011 and about a year later it stopped working. I called Amazon and explained the situation and they sent a new one ASAP, with a return shipping label for the old one at no cost. Greta prices AND good customer service. Wish they had a store front!!",5,amazon.com
9683,"I shop and purchase from Amazon at lease once a month if not more. They tend to have much better prices on a lot of items compared to other retailers.  I've purchased many different categories of items and haven't had a bad experience yet. I love that if you purchase $25.00 worth of products that say are eligible for Super Saver Shipping you get free shipping! Just make sure that you check the box that says ""Super Saver Shipping"" at checkout! I haven't tried Amazon Prime yet though so I can't comment on that program.  I really enjoy having the choice to purchase some items new or used (music cds and books). The great part is that some of these used items qualify for Super Saver Shipping which helps to save even more money! There are buyer choices listed to click on for the prices of new and used items so you can scroll through to see which qualify. The used listings also list the rating of the item; i.e. Used - Like New, Used - Good, Used - Acceptable. There are other types but I didn't list them all here.  They also have seller reviews for private sellers which includes their seller percentage rating. It's a good idea to click on their profile to get a better idea of how many items they've sold and view some of their feedback to see if they appear to be reputable. I find that Amazon is my first stop when I'm at the start of the research process for an item. The user reviews are extremely helpful and I rely on them to help me make decisions on purchasing products whether I buy them on their site or not. Amazon users! Keep those product reviews coming, good or bad to help let other shoppers know what we as consumers think of their products! Enjoy the Amazon experience!",5,amazon.com

9688,"Hands down the best online retailer. Best prices, customer service, reliable reviews, etc. Amazon sets the bar for retailers, including even local brick and mortar retailers. A great thing to do is to walk around local stores and search the same products on Amazon for comparison and reviews using your cellular phone and the Amazon app. And they sell almost everything. With Amazon, you could survive without ever stepping foot outside to buy anything.",5,amazon.com

9697,"I have ordered from Amazon since its inception, usually on a monthly basis. Knock on wood but, to date, I've never had a complaint. At first, I only shopped for books, now I check with them first for anything I order. I am amazed that their prices are usually as good as, or better than, the competition. I even have a link to their site on my blog. I was really excited when I published my first poetry book, at the age of 65 - which is available on Amazon! Products I order arrive quickly, even from member suppliers. I' have never had to return anything. Amazon is my number one source for reasonably priced audiobooks. I can't drive a block without one playing!",5,amazon.com

Amazon Prime gets me free two day shipping and there is never any problem returning anything. When I am in hurry, I can usually have something delivered next day for 3 bucks (less than the cost of a coffee from Starbucks!). Amazon.com is the yard stick that all others try to emulate (but don't quite get it).",5,amazon.com
9701,"I order from here all the time. No matter what I need, I go here for fantastic prices and shipping. They use to only sell cds and books when they first came out. Now you can get pretty much anything! If your a prime member you receive free 2 day shipping on all your orders. I never had any serious issues. When ordering constantly online there will always be a bump or two, but with AMAZON, they take good care of you. Their online chat is quick and easy and they do everything they can for you. Broken item? They replace it right away and won't bother you like some other sites. Got a bad seller? They take care of the problem for you. By far the best customer service you will find online. A++++",5,amazon.com
9702,"I have been using Amazon.com for several years and highly recommend it. I've purchased everything from vacuum cleaner bags to electronics. My most recent purchase was a Slime tire gauge.

So far I haven't had any negative experiences.",5,amazon.com

9711,Love my new shoes Jeffrey Campbell!!,5,amazon.com
9712,I have been buying from Amazon for years now and never had a bad experience as long as my merchandise was sold and shipped by Amazon and not one of their sellers. Not to say the sellers are all bad but Autopro jacked me for a Linkin Park Cd I ordered. He claimed it was autographed by Chester Bennington and it was supposed to be a collector's item. He also claimed to have one left. The day after I ordered this CD Autopro listed this same CD (Not yet released by the band) as having 4 in stock and the price went up. They were no longer collectors items and none were autographed. I never did get the cd but Amazon was very good about returning my money. I can't say that about paypal.,5,amazon.com

9759,Been using Amazon for years and have never had a bad experience. The one time I had a problem they took care of the problem quickly and refunded a portion of the sale to make me happy. The only warning I would give is that when purchasing through Amazon sometimes you are buying through another company that is listing their product on Amazon. You can see several companies may be listing the same item and you can chose which you prefer. The biggest problem is that people jump too quickly onto the cheapest price. Remember cheaper isn't always better look at the ratings and know that the reduced price could be because they have bad ratings so the price is to entice you over to them. I always go with the more reputable option and to be honest the price difference is normally only a few dollars. Not worth the headache of chasing the other company down to get your order!,5,amazon.com

Now with the Amazon app on my cellphone, I find myself in stores double checking the price of items, often buying off of Amazon on the spot instead of paying extra in the store.

9776,"During this time of recovery from an economic downturn, people are saving money and have become more frugal than ever before. Many people have cut back on the luxury items and only focused on obtaining the necessities. Going to the movies with high priced tickets and popcorn was a luxury that many people cut back on. As we began to embrace these cut backs we put together a list of websites to watch movies and/or tv on to little or no cost. We kept in mind a number of things such as affordability, reliability, clarity, and much more. Amaazon's instant videos are very easy to the navigate and sift through. The sites pros are that the prices for the movies are clearly displayed. They have a wide variety of free videos. It is a trusted and credible website that is not know to give viruses. It has great customer support. The cons is that all of the movies aren't free and the website doesn't have inviting and appealing colors that would make you want to log onto their website. But I would definitely recommend this site to a friend.",5,amazon.com

No real problems, but the selection could be better. Also, they should have previews available even when the video is available for free - I want to know what it is before spending my time watching it. I usually switch to another browser and copy/paste the URL to watch the amazon preview.",5,amazon.com

9819,"Especially in such tough financial times, it is important to cut cost for the company I am working for. I have found amazing deals on products we need for the office and also items such as computer parts and security equipment. I found the time clock ink we use that is usually 20 dollars at the store for only 3 with shipping included! This site has helped us keep cost down and keep our prices competitive for our customers. If you are looking for a good deal, I suggest you check out this site first!",5,amazon.com
9820,"Have ordered a multitude of things from Amazon, including lots of free Kindle books. I have never had a bad experience. A few Kindle books I paid fees for did not meet my expectations, so I asked for a refund. They processed the refund immediately back to my credit card, no questions asked. Excellent, extremely convenient site and competitively priced as well!",5,amazon.com

Been using this website for over 3 years now and love everything about it!  This is one of rare websites you can really trust!",5,amazon.com
9823,"I did most of my holiday shopping on Amazon since I don't live anywhere close to my family. All the gifts were gift wrapped and delivered directly to their door and I didn't have to worry about a thing.  I also love my Kindle, so I'm a frequent shopper. Whether accessories or e-books, I can always find exactly what I need, and I trust the reviews, so I know exactly what to expect when I receive it.  The only problem I've had with Amazon was taken care of immediately - they refunded my money for the defective item within a few days. Highly recommend - I really appreciate their customer service.",5,amazon.com
9824,I am a big reader as well as a jeweler and crafts person. I have never been disappointed with Amazon in all the years I've used the site. I love the book reviews and also the ability to look in some of the pages of books. That second feature has saved me a lot of money. I also love the previews on recorded music.

9827,Where you should be buying everything! Best prices and quicker deliveries! Buy everything here!,5,amazon.com
9828,Amazon.com is a website that sells a wide variety of items. I have been shopping on this site for about 10 years and have always received everything on time and in good condition. I have also downloaded music and games. The prices are reasonable and the customer service is o.k. (I've only had to use it once and that was years ago so it may have improved since then). I definitely recommend this site.,5,amazon.com
9829,"I love Amazon. It's usually the first site I check when I need to buy something. I am a prime member and I love the free 2-day shipping. That might be the only reason I shop from them so much. I hate waiting to get stuff in the mail even if it's just laundry detergent! I buy almost everything I need on Amazon: clothes, kitchen stuff, books, and even toilet tissue.  The one suggestion I have to make is that you really have to read the reviews thoroughly. Don't just go by the number of stars that a product has. I find that many users will give a bad rating just because it wasn't shipped on time or it arrived damaged which has nothing to do with the product itself.",5,amazon.com
9830,"They have everything! Amazon customer service is a part time job for you if you have a problem, but it could be worth the effort for hard to get items. Amazon has been a great shopping resource for me but I only purchase NEW items and double check everything before placing the order. I had to give them another star because they really try to give the best in customer service! You really need to research your product and who is fulfilling the order before you buy! AMAZON DONT CHANGE ANYMORE!! KEEP THE GREAT RETURN POLICY AND YOU WILL KEEP CLIENTS!!!",5,amazon.com

9832,Best retailer on the web - IMHO I buy almost everything from Amazon. I certainly check all prices against their site. I buy all my MP3s from them. I get a catalog of all my purcheses and if a previous purchase needs to be downloaded again it is simple to ask for a link to get it again. I have had only 2 issues over the past several years and they handled it promptly and professionally. This is the reason I buy from Amazon. They rock!,5,amazon.com
9833,GOld prices and shipping always happens in the specified time,5,amazon.com

I recommend Amazon to everyone I know. Thanks Amazon for an awesome site!!,5,amazon.com
9835,There is no reason i do not recommend this site to you.,5,amazon.com
9836,"LOVE this online company!!!! I have purchased likely over fifty items from them and have never been dissatisfied! The prime membership is awesome! You get two day delivery, sometimes it is one day! I have thought about purchases for birthdays once the week has hit, and felt like I wouldn't be able to get a gift.

Their daily gold box deals are great and sometimes there are very good deals if you are patient.,5,amazon.com

9842,Fast delivery low prices!,5,amazon.com
9843,"One of my favorites sites to shop. Very trustworthy and no-nonsense shopping. Customer service is great as most customer service related issues is automated electronically and instantly. Prices are fair, not always the best, but fair and honest. I have never had a problem with Amazon.com directly as they are prompt, professional, and efficient. I have had an issue with a private seller that was selling on amazon, but that can not be blamed on amazon directly. Bottom line, would do business with again and again and again anytime.",5,amazon.com
9844,"Love using amazon.com, but especially amazon prime! It's so great how it comes within two days!",5,amazon.com
9845,Been an Amazon Prime Member since they started the program. My first stop for all purchases online (and I do as little brick & mortar shopping possible.)

9855,"My husband and I have had an Amazon.com account for almost 10 years. We love them. We have bought so many things from them over the years. Also, they have a cool exchange program now for textbooks, movies, video games, and electronics. You send them into Amazon (after doing an online setup where they tell you how much your items are worth and you print out a UPS shipping) and then you get Amazon credit. I sent in a bunch of stuff last summer and got $160!",5,amazon.com

What else can you ask for?",5,amazon.com
9858,"I've had too many good experiences with amazon to tell you about. ANY problem, consider it taken care of. Drop your $200 Kindle? Even a year or so after you purchase it, they replace it without it costing you one penny. Best customer service in the world.",5,amazon.com
9859,This is my favorite way of shopping on internet now as the prices are absolutely first class and the delivery is amazingly quick especially if you are an Amazon Prime member (free delivery next day).

9864,"WHEN IN DOUBT... ORDER WITH AMAZON! Have been dealing with Amazon for years and hundreds of transactions later, they have NEVER disappointed me! Only had one case where vendor's merchandise received was not as described and Amazon made it right within 48 hours. There are thousands and thousands of online websites to choose from - many of which will cause you frustration and grief - Amazon is Customer Service defined and makes online shopping fun!",5,amazon.com
9865,"Purchased hundreds and hundreds of things here. No complaints at all, it is a great place to buy. It has something that I can't still point out completely that makes it stand out from the crowd. I've thought about it long and hard as I want to understand this je ne sais quoi to use in some of my work, but still haven't fully pointed it out.  I think it goes somewhere around ease of use, great policies on returns, fast shipping, amazon prime and good products all around. But, there are still a few things that I feel that can't explain.  That being said, fully recommended.",5,amazon.com
9866,"always the best site for all those hard to find items, and great prices for easy to find items!",5,amazon.com
9867,"Great shopping experience, 1000's of products, all available to view online. Delivery is fast and often free, 9 times out of 10 they are cheaper than other retailers. I love the wishlist application, a great way to build a birthday or wedding shopping list. A great way to preorder games and DVD's before release, and you only have to pay the lowest price on release day. I will continue to send buy business Amazon' way.",5,amazon.com
9868,"Recently purchase my kindle, and after the hype I was sure ready to feel the let down. Turns out it never came.  With the population of the vast majority of books I would like to read in the next 10 years, the kindle has opened a whole new world to me. I read treasure island last week, just while on the metro. Truly superb.  I am also 100% in love with the product suggestions as they are bang on and are the reason I read the hunger games. I have now fully converted to the e-reader (other than text books) and do not think that I will be going back any time soon. (perhaps for the beach I can make an exception, seems the kindle may be a bit fearful of the sand.)",5,amazon.com

9873,"WAY TOO COOL! I've bought from this site plenty of times and only had a proble once (bought a pair of aviatores for $1.25, they were great but they were missing a plastic nose piece. Long story short I contacted the distributor and ended up with three extra pairs of sunglasses) It all really depends on who you buy from, if it is CRAZY cheep or it has bad/no reviews then you may be taking a risk. Otherwise it should always be a great experience! PLUS! NO TAX IN CALIFORNIA!!!!",5,amazon.com

9876,"I have spent more than $5,000 on amazon.com since it was established. I have had no problem with amazon at all. Once I bought a PSP from them and it was stolen when the post office delivered. I contacted amazon, and they sent another one immediately. I was extremely impressed.",5,amazon.com
9877,"Hands down best ""everything"" store there is on the web. Great deals, fast shipping, good customer service. I can buy a book for $5 on Amazon that would normally be $25 elsewhere. I also love their free super saver shipping, where you get free shipping if your order totals $25 or over. This qualifies for most items on Amazon but not with the individual sellers. As far as they go, I do buy from individual sellers frequently. Books, mostly. I wouldn't be caught dead buying any craft supplies on Amazon, though. The shipping is something like $7 for a pack of stickers! That's the only gripe I have. Everything else is great. I also love their Personal Recommendations. Always right on the money with what I like...and always makes me end up buying more stuff than I originally planned! With me, I go on for something specific and end up going on an Amazon shopping spree (and going broke lol). Love!",5,amazon.com

9880,Great sight to buy mostly anything. Have bought products on this sight when I could have drove to a nearby store.,5,amazon.com
9881,"To me, this is the most amazing market on the web. They are very serious with their work, it doesn't matter if the items are being sale from them or from a third party, they always fulfill what they promise. Prices may vary a lot as they have many people and companies offering their products, but you can yet find very good prices, as you have a lot to choose from, and very important the shipping time is always, always, as they say it will be... or less. I have bought 76 items from this site, I am not the bigger buyer, but I can speak through my experience.",5,amazon.com
9882,"I have ordered from Amazon com, Amazon.co.uk and Amazon.fr. All items have been cheap, good quality, arrived in a very short time and well packaged. Superb site for all sorts of stuff and so handy when you live very rurally like I do.

9886,I have ordered many items from amazon.com over the years. They are dependable and have great prices. I have also ordered from the amazon marketplace and have gotten even better deals on occasion than what amazon's offering price for an item was. On eof the best things about this site is that they offer reviews on their items from the consumer so you can get an idea of what real people think of the item you plan on purchasing. This can be especially helpful if you are buying household or electronics of any kind. These reviews have made a difference as to whether or not I purchased an item. I have never had a bad experience with this site and will continue to utilize it for my shopping needs.Great site!!!,5,amazon.com
9887,"It's my favorite place to buy anything online. Extremely well put together site. I've spent more money on amazon than all the other sites combined. I've shopped with them for around 8 years. Pretty much anything you could want shopping wise you can order it on amazon. E-books, mp3's, digital games, android apps, clothes, books, cd's, furniture, etc. They have lately been pushing much harder into the digital distribution area with their mp3's and their cloud service. Like I said, my favorite place to shop.",5,amazon.com
9888,I have been very satisfied with Amazon. I have bought Christmas gifts for my family and electronics for myself. I bought a Kindle and so far have been able to read for 0 dollars because they have so many out-of-copyright books. I had to return an item once that I bought by mistake and it went very smoothly. The shipping has mostly been free and the prices better than competitive.,5,amazon.com
9889,"Did you ever wonder why this site is the No. 1 on-line retailer? It has to be because they make sure the customer is satisfied. You have a problem? Contact them and its taken care of. That also happens to be the only area where you might run into a problem since they outsource their help to some Third World country where the help is apparently reading from a script if you call, and just send you a scripted comment if you write. Sometimes it won't even have a thing to do with your problem! This is the one area Amazon needs to improve upon. Otherwise, I can find items there I can't find elsewhere at a decent price - and always make sure to order at least $25 worth of stuff so I don't get stuck with paying shipping. No complaints about the service - I seem to order at least $100 worth of stuff from them per month. Now.....if they'd just quit inundating people with ads for their Kindle - its the first thing you see when you go to the site - enough already!!",5,amazon.com
9890,"LOVE this site! Order anything I can from it--so easy, and the free shipping over $25 is amazing!",5,amazon.com

9894,Best selection on the web. Low Prices.,5,amazon.com
9895,"I am a huge book lover and I always use Amazon to order back titles, classics and any new releases. I am not really a fan of most modern literature so I am lucky they have a big range of options from the middle American history which in my opinion is the most vibrant literary period. Sometimes you find products listed on the site which are not sold directly by Amazon, mostly these are second hand books so watch out for that but normally it is really clear. Obviously the shipping varies because it depends where the seller is located, so if you need your book fast then order direct from the main website. What I really need to praise is the customer service. I bought a book and the post service messed up so it got sent back and the order was automatically refunded. When I went back to order it again (not Amazon's fault, right?) the price was higher. I emailed them and they agreed to sell me the book at the original price I would have paid. I don't know if they always do that but their service was awesome!",5,amazon.com
9896,"Have never been dissapointed in this site.. Items are exactly as offered, and ship very fast. You can get almost anything here.Definitely not just for books and CD's.",5,amazon.com

For $79.95 a year (that's $6.66 a month) - everything you buy (that Amazon fulfills) will be 2 day shipping FREE. With this feature, I don't bother to go out in the 100 degree weather here in Texas to buy something at Target...I order it from Amazon....and its here in 2 days !!",5,amazon.com

The free shipping has made me extremely happy with Amazon and extremely unhappy when other companies fail to match Amazon's level of shipping service. - Check out prices elsewhere when you want to buy something - most of the time you'll come right back to Amazon. If you want electronics, I highly recommend sticking to either Amazon or Newegg.",5,amazon.com
9900,Great website great products speedy delivery,5,amazon.com
9901,I never had any problem with amazon. It's my favorite site. I only order from other websites when I can't find the item in amazon.,5,amazon.com
9902,"I've been a customer for over 10 years.. and I've never had a bad experience. This is simply the best site to buy anything they are selling. The prices are very good, not always the best. You might get better deals on other sites, but its much more convenient to not have to create new accounts with other vendors, enter my credit card info, and possibly get sketchy service. I can look up what I am looking to purchase, read reviews to make sure I'm getting the best in class product, click and buy. Easy. Best of all it is at my door in 2 days (sometimes one) with Prime. No joke - I would say 90% of my discretionary spending is on amazon, from my TV and coffee maker to my underwear and socks. Also the customer service and return policy is great. My only gripe is that since I moved to New York I now have to pay sales tax.",5,amazon.com
9903,I have consistently received my items from Amazon earlier than noted in my confirming which I think is an added bonus. I have yet to be unable to find something I wanted on their site. It's truly incredible that I can now get everything I've ever wanted online!,5,amazon.com

9905,"Got to love Amazon. After my ebay account got hacked and paypal took it out on me, I moved to Amazon and really enjoy the products and the service. The reviews there are very helpful and the ratings accurate.",5,amazon.com
9906,As a buyer on Amazon.com I must say it is a great site. While buying on amazon you can sometime find a great deal. If buy some items from them directly as oppose to buying from sellers you have the chance of receiving the items within days of the purchase.  I must say to some point it becomes addictive due to their great quick and reliable services. Some special offers and discounts due come in from time to time that makes shopping at amazon a must.,5,amazon.com
9907,"I love Amazon. Just about everything you would want is on here. I have only had to complain one time and they fixed it immediately. basically I pre-ordered a game and received it as promised. A week later it was $20 cheaper. I wasnt happy so i sent an email. Two days later i had $20 credit on my account. The prime membership is the way to go, i am a student so i got mine free. Most everything arrives in two days thanks to my prime membership.  Roughly 50 orders over the last few years and am super happy with Amazon!",5,amazon.com

9909,"I have never had a bad experience with Amazon. Customer service is terrific, they always respond promptly and they are very helpful. I have also bought from individual sellers and so far, my experiences have been good. They also tend to have great prices, especially when it comes to books. If you're a student, you might like their student program, in which they offer discounts on clothing and other items just for students. This program has been great for me, as you get free shipping benefits the first year. These are usually part of the Prime membership (which is not free, about $79 a year last time I checked). However, if you're a regular buyer, the price could be worth it.",5,amazon.com
9910,I have been buying books from Amazon for the past three years or more. I never cease to be amazed at the breadth and speed of service. I buy mostly non-fiction titles and their options of new and second-hand offers is utterly comprehensive. The same service is available for a wide variety of other items and always my satisfaction has been 100%. On the odd occasion when mistakes have been made (by me as well as Amazon) they are quickly rectified without cost to me.,5,amazon.com
9911,"I've been an Amazon shopper since 2002 and spend quite a bit there on everything from food to $1800 diamond earrings to a lawnmower and generator. I've purchased incredible bargains and some not so hot, but that was my choice since Amazon did not make the item! My customer service interactions have been fair to excellent, mostly quite good. You must remember and honor their 30 day return rule for easy and swift returns' refund. As long as any seller shown on Amazon's site is part of the Amazon guarantee program, they really will act on your behalf to correct the issue or provide a full refund which I was pleased to experience. They will refund or replace if food is expired or there is some other legitimate reason. Sadly they have really cut back on the Friday Gold box deals, but then now I don't impulse buy as much either. I visit there everyday and can find just about everything I need or at least a link to an external site.",5,amazon.com
9912,"I go to amazon.com for just about anything that I need, however, books are the thing that I buys the most of. I can always get what I am looking for no matter when it was published or how old or how long out of print it is. The best prices, too! Joe W.",5,amazon.com
9913,"I love Amazon.com. I have had a lot of experience dealing with them. I purchase maybe $2000 a year of products from them. They are always quick and they have lots of hard to find items. I love reading the reviews on their site.  Once a $100 item never came to my home. They said it was delivered. I contacted them and told them I didn't get it. They sent another one out without any questions. I couldn't believe it. They were so nice and professional. I also get free shipping because I'm a prime member because I bought textbooks from them for college, which were cheaper than my school's bookstore. As long as they don't change then I will always be a happy customer.",5,amazon.com

9922,"Amazon is a great place to buy almost anything. I must admit that it is mainly books that I buy from them but my wife buys almost anything (curtains, excercise bikes, software, dvds). It is very easy to use (perhaps to easy) with your shopping being divided into several departments. As for books. It probably has about 99% of all books available and it is interactive so you can leave a review of any books you buy. Overall - essential.",5,amazon.com
9923,"My son wanted a toy at Target, but I told him to wait until he saved his money. Once he saved his money I took him back to Target, but the toy had been discontinued. My son was heartbroken, and he worked so hard at saving up for the toy. Fortunately Amazon had a used version. I ordered the toy and it arrived exactly when they said it would. The bonus is that it was half the price compared to when it was in the store. I highly recommend Amazon.com",5,amazon.com
9924,"Amazon.com - what more can I say about it that hasn't been said already? I've been buying items from Amazon since 2003 and have never, not once, had a negative experience. I realize that now, with the various sellers, there's some more risk, but I tend to avoid those and go straight for the items sold by Amazon. And now that I own a Kindle.",5,amazon.com
9925,"LOVE amazon! Been shopping there for years. Great place to buy books, I've even sold a couple of text books there and got more than I could from the school bookstore even with the amzaon fee, I use it a lot to check out reviews before I buy products even if I don't buy them there...just can't say enough about it! I also have auto order set up for diapers and wipes and get the CHEAP with the auto order discount plus the amazon mom discount and FREE shipping:) Also joined amazon student for free shipping for a year. Great place to find discontinued and hard to find items...bought a 3 pack of my favorite face powder for cheap after I couldn't find it in stores. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",5,amazon.com

9928,"I love this site. I order probably 90% of online shopping (which I do frequently) thru amazon. I have had a free prime membership for a year because I order diapers with them and I love that they usually have 20% off diapers in the parenting magazines since their diapers are already pretty cheap compared to most stores.  During the holidays, an item I ordered was delivered according to UPS but I never received and amazon sent out a new item OVERNIGHT with no questions asked. Not sure if it's because I order from them a lot or what but I was kind of surprised by their quick response since it was obviously not their fault that UPS delivered to the wrong house.",5,amazon.com
9929,"Excellent selections. Excellent Service. Amazon has made our providing computer services a whole lot easier over the last few years. I'd have to honest say that They are cheapest 90 - 95% of the time we price shop. Better yet, we are PRIME customers. For only $69.00 (or so) a year, we get free 2nd say shipping or for $3.99 get overnight shipping. Regardless the size or weight. We are probably placing 10-15 orders per week, and to be frank, I know they are losing money on us when it comes to the PRIME account. But they have no limit. As far a 3rd party purchases, I have on occasion had a problem with the 3rd party vendor. In every case it only took 1 email to Amazon and I got a refund within hours. As far as the reviewer complaining about Amazon selling so much more than books ... that really is a silly complaint. If you are searching, you can specify to ONLY search books. Come on, if it bothers you that much, then go buy your books at Barnes and Noble ... and pay more. In our case, about 98% or all purchases are NOT books. Seriously, what's NOT to like about Amazon. On a scale of 1 to 10, they are a clear 10 for me and our business.",5,amazon.com
9930,"I've ordered hundreds of times over the last five or six years and have always been satisfied. I especially appreciate how they really work to get holiday gifts delivered on time. The only thing less than perfect is that it's challenging to get a phone number and a human to talk to but otherwise, they are way better than any other site I've dealt with.",5,amazon.com
9931,"The BEST site for ordering items around. Hastle free returns, trusted ordering. Makes ordering online easy. Just be careful, because some of the links send you to another website, and then you are no longer ordering through Amazon itself... but otherwise you are good-to-go.",5,amazon.com
9932,I've bought many items on Amazon and my experience with all of them has been positive. I would buy again.,5,amazon.com
9933,Best site ever. I find everything that I need there :),5,amazon.com
9934,"Although Amazon has expanded to being a middleman of sorts selling such things as whole fresh rabbit, shaving oil and hungarian paprika - they're still good for your basics: books and music. I've never received a wrong item from them and have had amazingly good experiences with the merchants selling used books. It can be annoying to browse for certain items, like trying to look for a diary with a day per page but their suggested items are very helpful and I sometimes end up buying more than I wanted, which isn't a bad thing - $25 and free shipping is always great! I think the trick in buying used books is to look at the individual sellers' feedback - it's ebay-esque. Their music downloads sometimes are $1 or $2 cheaper than iTunes and they often have $5 album deals.",5,amazon.com
9935,"I love how you can go there and find just so much variety on, well... everything. They certainly make it easy to see a ton of choices on whatever you need and pick out the best deals. Also there are customer reviews on so many of the books and products. Perfect.",5,amazon.com

9939,I have always had great experiences with Amazon. You can find a ton of deals and just about anything you can think of. The marketplace allows you to find deals at the lowest price available. The site is user friendly and their customer service is about average for that type of site.,5,amazon.com
9940,"Little more needs to be said. I am an Amazon Prime member for over a year. Great quick shipping. I have returned expensive electronics, no questions asked or disputed. No shipping costs on return. I will pay an extra dollar to buy from Amazon. Not one of their outside sellers, tho. You take your choice and your chances with their outside seller.",5,amazon.com

9944,"I have purchased various products at amazon from books, magazines, shoes, clothes, outdoor gear, and even an imac. I have always been impressed with their quick shipping. You can also avoid shipping charges though various amazon promotions.

9947,"I've been ordering items off Amazon for the past 6 years, and I have yet to have a bad experience with them (knock on wood). Eveything to college textbooks to TVs, it all been hassle-free. Granted there are times when items aren't shipped out as fast as Amazon says they will be, but if it's going to be late, Amazon has always sent me emails explaining it will be late.  The trick to making the smaller purchases worth it, like one reviewer stated, is to order $25 worth of stuff in a single order to qualify for the free shipping. You have to wait a few extra days most of the time, but if you can put up with the wait, it ends up being a good deal. My one complaint (annoyance really) about Amazon are the fluctuating prices. I've seen item prices start at a specific amount drop by $50, then jump up by $75, only to drop by $60. All in a single week. My opinion: if you're considering purchasing something large at Amazon, watch the price for a few days before you buy it. Nothing is more annoying than a price dropping $50 a day after you buy the item. Overall a great site to buy from!",5,amazon.com

Sellers in general try to provide good customer satisfaction because otherwise they may get a bad rating. In general it has been a good experience purchasing from amazon. And if there is a problem, chances are that you can get a refund. One cool thing I like from amazon is that it offers product reviews and at the same time in some cases you can see what customers buy more often among related products of your interest. This helps to make knowledgeable decisions before buying. Best regards ! :)",5,amazon.com

Amazon Prime is amazing and if you are a student (college??), you get a year's trial! I am using it to it's max. :) I love it and can't rave enough about them.

You can find almost anything you want and with their marketplace you can often find things cheaper than in a regular store.

I've been using it for long enough to know that any complaints I read are - presumably - few and far between - otherwise, given the amount I buy, I would have experienced at least some problems by now. The review system - maybe started by Amazon? - seems to concentrate seller's minds and also gives buyers a pretty accurate insight into a product's worth - providing you are sophisticated enough to detect false or misleading posts. But I'm also confused now. I went to this review posting to check my preconceptions that Amazon would have rave reviews and I have seen a few damning ones.

9985,What I love about this site is that the books that I have bought have been at a great price. Also the book sellers are REQUIRED to accept returns and issue REFUNDS. Amazon realizes that something bought off the internet can be vastly different in person and gladly accepts returns.,5,amazon.com
9986,one click shopping what more can you ask for! Purchased all my Christmast gifts last year from Amazon and i will be doing the same this year. LOVE AMAZON!,5,amazon.com
9987,"Amazon has it or you don't need it. They ship fast. Offer good products at good prices ship, packed well and are reliable and have kept me totally satisfied for several years.",5,amazon.com
9988,"Amazon.com is one of the best sites I have ever dealt with. I joined the amazon prime membership that gives you among other things free 2 day shipping and over night shipping for about 3 dollars more. Today I found their student program that allows you to signup via your school email and gives you a free year of amazon prime, while I was looking for a link or help to ask if I could combine my two accounts or cancel my old prime accout, I notced an email that was from amazon stateing they had already done this and ontop of that they refunded me for the remainder of the year on my original prime account wich is 79 a year well worth it if you buy a lot for the shipping benifits alone. The refund for fo 76 dollars. Combined with their great products and stuff like this amazon is one of the greates sites on the web today. I just want you to know that i am not getting any compinsation for this review.",5,amazon.com
9989,Amazon is a website for the masses. It allows for people to buy just about anything and everything. I have used the site to purchase numerous items and have yet to be disappointed. The website itself is simple enough for the most unintelligent person to navigate it. While offering a broad range of offerings to the table. Amazon in my eyes outshines any other site that rivals it because of it's ability to help people sell their stuff in stores within amazon. The checkout process is quick and painless and the shipping process is above average for a website of it's size with super saver shipping to allow for the customer to save on shipping. The one thing I like the most is the ability to buy used over new stuff to save money and if the item is not what you wanted you can return it with out hassle. I give Amazon 4 stars for being one of the leading websites for the shopper in all of us.,5,amazon.com
9990,"Amazon.com can be a great place to shop for a wide variety of products. Their inventory is rooted from a vast number of suppliers and probably more often than not you're actually dealing with them more-so with amazon being a middle-man. At least, it seems that way to me. And so, Amazon.com can be a great place to buy things -- even toys. However, the prices for such items can be a bit on the high-end depending on the product.  Prices can vary from ""new"" or even ""used"". Where toys are concerned, the prices can be ludicrous depending on when it was issued. Toys that were issued yester-year may be on the limited-side and will have their prices inflated. Sometimes you can surf through the various vendors that a particular product is catered from, sifting through their prices. Something to be mindful of is that one vendor may appear to be cheaper, but their shipping is higher. Like ebay, you want to check on the feedback of the seller. Believe of not, even they can disappoint at times. It's rare, but I've had it happen. Sometimes similar looking products can be mixed up and that whole bag. It's not something to be worried about, but aware of what you're prodding at. So, if you're wishing to acquire that particular item or get a price feel for something, amazon.com can be a good place to scope out along with your other web surfing 'ventures.",5,amazon.com
9991,"I have probably order over 50 times from amazon in the last 10 years and have never had any problems with any orders. Never been shipped any wrong items (once was shipped the same item twice for a single order which customer service told me not to worry about it) and orders always arrive in a timely fashion. Don't be scared about the delivery time frame for items with their super saver free shipping option -- it usually arrives before they say. Only opt for the overnight / 2nd day shipping options if you absolutely need to have the item in hand by a certain date. Be aware that if you buy items from amazon stores / sellers, those items won't qualify for free shipping, although the shipping is usually quite reasonable. With amazon sellers, the items can come a little slower, so if possible I usually opt to get items from amazon themselves.",5,amazon.com
9992,i buy just about everything for my entertainment ... somethings i've bought were as cheap as 1 cent..... i don't think i've ever spent more then 30 dollars on one item there before...,5,amazon.com
9993,I have been using/shopping at Amazon.com for several years. I LOVE it! I almost always go to Amazon first when looking for books or music. Their prices and shipping times are amazing!,5,amazon.com
9994,"Always spot-on. They have sooo much to offer, and much with free shipping. Extremely fast shipping as items come from a warehouse close to you. No sales tax in CA, either. :)",5,amazon.com
9995,"I have never had a problem with amazon.com, they are amazing and actually ship things when they say they are going to.",5,amazon.com
9996,Who doesn't love Amazon.com? They have almost every product on the entire earth and ship very fast. The business intelligence feature of the site provides you with additional products you may be interested in or what other people have purchased.  I bought a digital video camera and paired it with the perfect tripod for cheap! I read online that the Amazon.com profit margin is somewhere between 1.5 - 3% on each item that they sell. This is how they are able to offer such low prices on everything. Big time amazon fan and a prime member. Highly recommend the site to purchase almost anything you need.,5,amazon.com
9997,I have bought a lot of books from Amazon. Good think about them is that you can then turn around and sell the book when you are done. I actually made a few dollars. Better then DISCOUNT BOOK SALE (http://www.discountbooksale.com/) - stay away from them!,5,amazon.com
9998,100% refunds always. Prompt and courteous. Best place to buy.,5,amazon.com
9999,"the best site to shop on, and even if you don't buy it here, the research will save you money. I always start here so I know what the real price of something is.",5,amazon.com
10000,"this website offers products sold by them or through them from other websites. I would recommend ordering products sold by Amazon, because if there is a problem then it is quicly corrected by Amazon.",5,amazon.com
10001,Amazon is web shopping done right. I've never had an issue that couldn't be easily resolved and the prices are almost always great.,5,amazon.com
10002,I have never had a problem Amazon. They are quick to deliver a product and offer daily deals.,5,amazon.com

10004,Very professional,5,amazon.com
10005,I have ordered books from Amazon several times. Every time they offered me nice shopping experience. It seems their website can guess what I am thinking and present the information right when I need them! They saved me a lot of time and money and I have no choice but continue to buy from them.,5,amazon.com
10006,"Absolutely fantastic! I got lots of cheap cd's and DVD box sets here....great value if you are hunting for a particular artist, I'd say --- Just recieved some CD's that I've been hunting for ages, I saved a fortune! Much better than HMV stores anyday",5,amazon.com
10007,Best MP3 store on the planet - best selection and best quality without drm,5,amazon.com
10008,"I LOVE amazon.com, which I can't say for a lot of websites, especially commercial ones where I find it hard entrusting my credit card information! Basically, Amazon.com is a fun, safe, and easy-to-use place that remains huge and popular, so I always feel assured it's reputable and other people have used it to their satisfaction. This store sells many, many products that anyone can need or want. So far I've bought books, including countless textbooks for when I was in college; music CDs and downloads; movie DVDs (including downloads straight to my computer); at least 3 headphones; special personal products that I couldn't find in stores; and I'm sure more than I can think of right now. The first reason I used this site was its reliability. I learned that they worked as a broker with some of the most dependable third-party online sellers on the planet. That means they do their research on the sellers so I don't have. All I do is look at the sellers' star ratings without having to look to bbb.org. Second, I used this site because of their consistent offer of the lowest prices that I still cannot match with other sites, no matter how hard I try, (which is a good relief when you have to buy expensive supplies in college!) Also, they have multiple payment options. Sometimes I don't have my credit card handy, so I use the bank account number that they already have stored (and safely stored, too). Another HUGE highlight of Amazon is the extra information they give on the lower half of the product page that helps the customer make the perfect purchase, such as the customer reviews, discussion areas, and recommendations. I've avoided a lot of bad purchases just by reading Amazon's reviews alone. The special features go further. I have also taken advantage of their Free Super Saver Shipping on qualified products over $25 and at least one of their gift cards. One card I printed out at the last minute when I forgot to buy a real gift!  As a seller, I've had great success getting rid of unwanted textbooks, music CDs, and a keyboard stand, without paying for a listing like on other sites. I did not make large profits off of all my sales, but that's only because Amazon offers extremely low prices. But I've still sold them to an extremely large pool of eager buyers all over the world.  Amazon keeps me interested in the product that I'm buying and coming back for more. Sometimes I look on the site just for the product reviews or recommendations. I've stuck with this site for years now and I hope that I won't have to give it up anytime soon.",5,amazon.com
10009,No wonder Amazon is the number one shopping website in the world. I like how they let other seller offer their products on amazon.com too next to Amazon's own product... this is how every website should be... fair and honest !,5,amazon.com
10010,"I shop amazon for many many things. I'm always amazed at what you can find. The prices are always lower than what you get in stores. Of course, you HAVE TO BE CAREFUL about third party sellers. I see reviews saying they are never shopping at amazon again because of a third party seller ripping them off. RESEARCH THE SELLERS and make sure you have contact information! I, fortunately, have never had a problem, and have bought plenty from third parties. But I'm always careful and hesitant. Amazon as a whole has great product, great prices, and great customer service. Especially from their own selection instead of third party. A buyer always has responsibility. It's the same with any website. I have refunded things and never had a problem. I've gotten my money back quickly and without delay or problem. If you're looking for something cheaper than what the price is in stores, chances are amazon has it. Great deals on books, dvds, blu-rays, and plenty of other things as well.",5,amazon.com
10011,I love Amazon.com. I frequent their site ofter. My orders are always on time and always packaged properly.,5,amazon.com
10012,I buy everything from Amazon. They are usually really accomodating when things go wrong and everything is cheaper than buying in stores.,5,amazon.com
10013,I really love Amazon. Their prices are always competitive.,5,amazon.com
10014,"What wouldn't I buy on amazon?! This is the first place I stop before purchasing anything. In my experience, amazon has pretty decent customer service if you can find the phone number. There were several times that the item I purchased dropped in price and I was able to get a credit for my next purchase. I purchased amazon prime this year and I'm hooked. Most of my packages come in exactly 2 days! For all the negative reviews of specific amazon sellers, although I haven't had a negative experience, I urge them to try to stick to products which have 'sold by amazon.com' in the description. Make sure to post a negative review for the seller on amazon, because I believe amazon kicks them off after several bad reviews.",5,amazon.com
10015,"Onine buying - This is a great site to buy cheap books and music. It also has electronics, great camera bundles, and more. If you want to know more, just check it out. You will not be disappointed!!! I Pormise!",5,amazon.com
10016,"Amazon puts me at ease - Amazon has been a place which I started buying books from years ago, then graduated to music. Since 2007, I've been purchasing photo stuff from them. Today, I recieved a lens which I ordered last week, but the lens for some reason didnt communicate with my Canon XSi, got error messages. This is the first time ever that I had an issue with anything I got from Amazon directly or their vendors.  I was a bit anxious about what might transpire now that I've received this item and it needs to be replaced. So, I started with their HELP pages for returns or credit, and an online email to them resulted in a reply within an hour stating that a new lens would be sent right away and that if I click on a web page which they gave, I could print out a free UPS shipping label to return the defective part.  Since this is my first time ever having to deal with Amazon on a return, I have to say, its very impressive to see them respond so quickly and so positively without hassle or long protracted letter writing and phone calls. My return is repacked ready to be dropped off at a UPS store or drop box, and my replacement lens has been shipped with a tracking number. They sent it at ""2nd Day Air"" with no charge to me.  That is how businesses should conduct themselves and not make life miserable for a customer who is justified in returning a defective product.  I am very impressed by Amazon, and if all turns out well as it seems to be, I will coninue to do business with them and will recommend them to others as well.",5,amazon.com
