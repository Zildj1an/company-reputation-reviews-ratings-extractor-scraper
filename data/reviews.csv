"AHV J21 This vehicle with an Uber sign in front window blasts through neighborhoods passing people on the right hand side when it's one lane each direction, in the heart of valrico near school zones",1
"I had a pre scheduled uber ride on 02/22/2019. I received a notice that the UBER driver, Charles had arrived at my home, but no UBER car outside. I walked the block to locate the UBER driver with no success. Then. UBER charged me for a missed ride. Bad UBER!!!",0
"They never showed up for the taxis we booked, they cancelled them and then charged me each time Â£6 cancellation fee. My clients were 45 minutes late as a result of me having to keep rebooking taxis with them. As a result I lost a large contract, as well as them trying to continually take payments from my account until my bank stopped all payments. When I complained about this issue I have have had no resolution and they still owe me a significant amount of money. We will never use them ever again. Trust your local taxi firms instead to turn up and not rip you off.",0
"I'm a frequent uber user and I had no problems until this uber pool decided to introduce the short walk crap. I'm always having issues with the drivers, as I see an address and the driver sees another address. And a cancellation fee? Are you serious? There are many incompetent drivers out there so why do I have to pay $5 fee when they cancel? I'm saying bye to this service and I will make sure all my friends are aware of your games.",1
"I am no longer a Uber rider anymore. They are admit that they did no wrong and that it could be my banks fault when clearly it's not. They are such screw overs, it's unbelievable... lost 27 dollars. They charged me $13.13 for a ride back to where I had to be at that time. The driver canceled and there was a cancelation fee of $5.00. So, I should've at least been given back $8.13, but I thought it was going to take some time to process. So after that ride was canceled, I had to call for another Uber driver, which cost $14.63 that one went pretty well. So, I checked my bank account when I got to my destination and saw that the money that I owed was already taken for that second trip, which was of course okay. But, the $8.13 was never given back to me. I then check mid-day yesterday and saw that the full amount of $13.13 and 14.63 was refunded to me and there were no pending signs or anything indicating that it wasn't set in stones. I checked my bank account today and saw a drop in the amount of money I originally had in my bank account. The history of the $13.13 refund was no where to be found and saw that the $14.63 was refunded to me TODAY and then taken out of my bank account TODAY. As much as it sounds weird, that is exactly what happened! They should be giving back that $27.76 that they charged me. They never sent a notification saying that they were going to so, and taking money out of my bank account like it's a toy, because it's not.",0
"When Uber runs over its customers. Buyer betware - Ueber is not all that is seems. At first I liked it. Ninety percent of the drivers are decent hard working honest people. But it's a crap shoot. I'd estimate ten percent are unscroupulous and should you ride with one of them Uber has no customer support. There's no phone whereby you can reach the driver or company. Case in point: Take Bill an apparently affable guy who will offer you a beverage on the way to your destination. Bill drives a Grand Cherokee and all indicators indicate that he is a criminal or accomplice to a crime. When Bill dropped me off at Planet Fitness I immediately noticed I left my bag containing an IPod and Bose headphones in the back seat. About $600 worth of equipment. I tried to wave him down but he wouldn't stop. Since then I have sent over 30 texts to him, the local Ueber office, and the corporate hub in Stamford. I even asked the Stamford police to investigate. As of this moment neither Bill nor Uebr care about larceny and they have no moral compass or desire for customer service. The car will get you from point A to poing B but after that your on your own. Uber won't lift a finger to help. Do you reaally want to take a chance with this company when you have your wallet, or keys, or handbag, or smartphone, or lose engagement ring on your finger? The smart answer is no. Bill is still out there. Lyft is the same as Uber. I'll check later today but smart money says they are much more conscientious than Uber who thinks its customer service is of no importance, even when expensive items disapper in one of their cars.",1
My rating keeps going down every time I ride. I am a pleasant customer. Either uber app is messed up or something else. Why no promotion's or discounts? I have been using it for past 2 years and no discounts. HuH! avoid.,0
"Uber charged me twice for the same ride and then told me one of my friends or my family must have used my charge account to book the second ride to the same place on the same day and they even added a tip for the driver of the ride I did not take. Uber's advertisement that you can now CALL Uber for customer service is a bald faced lie, there is no phone number and no customer service by phone whatsoever. Uber's business model is based on lies, dishonesty, and illegal behavior as anyone who follows current news can see.",0
"I've wasted several hours of my time trying to register for this app. It's a scam. The support desk is completely incompetent, too.",0
I scheduled my ride 3 days ago for Friday night to go to an event that cost me $450. The ride never showed so I scheduled another ride. Confirmed it and another no show. I ended up driving myself and being late. Inexcusable.,0
"It's a bad company and the pay sucks. Uber clams that your in independent contractor but in reality your a total employee to them. Example Uber controls your account, the support line sucks, they are a waste of my time. I highly recommend everyone don't ever work for these thieves. My account is on hold for over a week and half for yearly background check up. I did nothing wrong these $#*!heads are pissing me off. They don't pay anything to the unemployment which means no support for you when they hold you account. Uber is a Nasty DEVIL!",0
"I used Uber last year and loved the service. I again ""attempted"" to utilize Uber last night (Halloween) for my 16 yr old daughter. Guess what? She ended up stranded miles from home due to YOUR inept incompetence. Needless to say, our Uber days are over. We will be utilizing Lyft from this point forward. Choose your merchants wisely!",0
"I wouldn't even give this ""company"" one star. First of all, their drivers always cancel my pool trips because they don't want to do pool trips and then I have to deal with the cancel fee and the trip money they take. Apart from dealing with this all the time, about a month ago I was out with a friend and my phone wasn't working so my boyfriend called an Uber for me, about a week later we realized that they had taken $150 out of the account because of some cleaning fee. They sent us a picture that looks like someone spilled water on the door and they said that was the reason. So we told them that I didn't do that and that that could be some random picture taken by their driver and they didn't care. They are not giving me my money back. They didn't even send me an invoice detailing the reason why they were taking that money, I had to ask them. So they basically stole my money. Be careful people. This guys don't care about you, they just want your money. I already deleted my account, I'm riding with Lyft from now on, I've never had a problem with them.",1
"My account was cloned, so I have having money taken out of my account for Uber trips and Uber Eats that I did not make/have. I tried using their Uber_support twitter account, and received the same automated message over and over. I then wrote back, and didn't get a reply. I then replied to my reply, and my issues was apparently taken to the appropriate team. Who then sent me the same automated message. I tried to again explain my concerns, but continued to received the same automated message. The charges still continued to come out of my account. When I messaged them about this, guess what.....THE SAME AUTOMATED MESSAGE. Terrible customer service!! If I could have given 0 stars that's what it would have been.",0
"I would give Ron, uber driver from Sante Fe negative stars if I could. On Oct. 12, 2018 we requested a uber driver to take us from our hotel to Sante Fe airport at 5:30am.The driver showed up, and intrduced himself as Ron. He seemed nice enough. My wife and I got in back, and proceeded to the airport. As we're driving, my wife and I are making small talk with him(where you from, how long you been an uber driver, and so on. Said he was from NY, and had been driving for uber in Sante Fe for 4 years. He started talking about tips, which I thought was very inappropriate. He said he buys water and hand sanitizer for his customers. I said ya, looks like a wet bar back here(lol). His demeanor quickly changed. He said "" you people are invading my privacy."" HUH! You ""have no bussuiness invading my privacy RIGHT, RIGHT"" (yelling at us) SCARY! We said we're just making small talk as he continued to yell at us. Finally, I told my wife I need to record this. He heard this, pulled over, and told us to get out. It was 5:45am, 40 degrees in an area that was dark no street light or bussinesses miles from our destination.He opened my wives door, and rudely told her to get out. He threw our luggage into the street and drove away. My wife is 65, and has a sling on her arm after a surgery. We didn't know what to do. It was our first uber ride, and I'm pretty sure our last.",1
"Sorry i have to review Uber Eats on this site, but cannot find any way to write a review on uber.com or ubereats.com Pathetic! Speaking of pathetic, my Eats order was delayed 5 minutes at a time for over an hour, and then the order was cancelled. BY UBER!! WTF?! As the customer, i thought i was the one who could cancel. I've never been fired by a merchant. I spoke with both Mae and Jose (a girl) and they even told me they have had similar experiences as ""customers"" of Uber Eats! Seriously?! when your own employees complain about their employer, things are broken!",0
"I took an Uber to the hospital but left my expensive cardigan in the car. I contacted the driver immediately from information provided in the app. He confirmed he had the cardigan. He said when he is back in my area he would drop it off. I did not hear back for a while so contacted him again. He said he would drop it off to me but I'd have to pay almost Â£45 for the trip or he ca drop it off at the Uber offices in Canary Wharf. I then asked he drops it off at Canary wharf. I also asked that he let me know the details I will need to collect the item. My fare to the hospital was Â£7 by the way. Anyway, the driver whose uber user name is ""Abobacar"" stopped responding to me. I contacted Uber and they said they had tried to contact him to no avail. So I suggested that they switch his access off to force him to come to the office but they did not respond to that request instead they pretended they could do nothing and that the driver is self employed so there's nothing they can do. I filed a Police report and the Police said they had a duty to resolve the issue on my behalf. I relayed the message to Uber but they declined. A few weeks after, Abobacar contacted them and claimed he was in an accident and that when he got the car back the cardigan was missing. So I asked if his insurance would pay for the missing item, they did not respond to that. The moral of the story is, if you have a problem with an Uber driver Uber will do absolutely nothing to help you resolve it. They appear to have a finders keepers policy. It is disgraceful. I still use Uber but will switch to a competitor as soon as I get a chance to find one. Also, I will send an invoice to Uber as advised by the police. I will follow up with feedback at a later date. Beware of ""ABOBACAR"" the Uber driver!",1
"Uber Support in USA is basically bunch of incompetent idiots. They are polite, and that is only positive thing one can say. But they have no clue about anything, totally useless and waste of time. My experience: I was having problem with uploading documents and updating account. (I uploaded documents, but it was not getting approved even though everything was in order). I called Uber support 1-800-593-7069 - First time I called, they reviewed documents, told me everything is fine and it will be approved within 2 hours - Next day I called again (as it was not approved) , they reviewed documents, told me everything is fine and it will be approved within 24 hours - It was not approved so I called third day, now they told me they can not approve it and I need to go to Greenlight hub in Toronto, to submit documents there , do (again) background check (even though nowhere on web site was asking for it) - I did go to Greenlight hub in Toronto 9 days ago. They were fast, professional took my documents, updated it, did a background check and said it will be 5 days to get results but after that it is all good and I should be able to continue driving with no problem - (because you can not phone to Greenlight hub in Toronto) I called Uber support today hoping to be able to verify simple thing : Did they get results of background hack and if everything is okay. Incompetent loser on the other side took a time to ""check"" and then said background check is okay but he kept repeating like a parrot "" we are in process of reviewing and it might take 7-15 business days"" . What are they reviewing he was not able to explain. Conclusion: calling Uber support is total waste of time, they are useless bunch of morons",0
A promotion was offered in my area to sign up as a driver for uber 200 dollars extra if 100 rides were completed in a month... I completed 100 rides in 10 daysbut never recieved my bonus... So i called uber driver support... Who hung up on me 3 times then transfered me arround their office as i asked to speak to their managers... With them all saying i never opted into that bonus program so i wouldnt be getting it... After i asked to speak to a manager for the third time the male i was speaking to said he was the highest up in management and that he had herd my problem amd wouldnt be doong a thing about it and that he didnt have any more time to spend on the phone with me and he hung up again.... Here i come lyft.... No wonder there arnt enough uber drivers... Now there is one more less.,0
"I have been unable to use my uber account for over a week, they cannot send a verification code to my phone, i tried a friends number, still not working, I called my provider, SMS messages are permitted, an after 16 emails to uber m they are still telling me they have a new team working on it and will resolve it, I have asked them to call me several time as they have numbers on their site that are definitely not uber. I cannot believe such a company gets away with this , they do not deserve business, I feel bad for their employees, I will be usong Lyft from now on!!",0
"They have little to no customer service. They have no actual person that you can speak to. They make it almost impossible. I have tried to explain to them in many different ways that they have charged me double for every trip that I have taken, and charged me double the tip for every trip that I have taken, and the money has come out of my bank account, but they still keep telling me that I have an outstanding balance and That I must pay it again!",0
"Car number plate: GFI4CZK This may not reflect the whole of UBER, however, as my first and subsequentially last UBER ride, I think its safe to say this driver was enough to turn me against using it ever again. First, he tried to overcharge my us for our luggage (literally 4 shopping bags), despite it fitting with an excess of room, then he refused to take us when we refused to pay the overcharged amount. Rude and horrible experience which reflects poorly on the whole company. Would recommend UBER to start sufficiently interviewing their drivers so we, as customers, do not have to put up with such disgusting manners which utterly ruined my day. It may be amazing in the US but in the UK you are graced with the most shocking drivers who have no concept of customer service. If you use UBER and get this number plate, then save yourself the bother and find another car.",1
"While visiting Nashville for a concert on August 25th, I scheduled an Uber ride at the quoted rate (iPhone app) of $21.xx. We traveled from 5th avenue, not far from Bridgestone Arena to the Gaylord Hotel. Upon arrival, I tipped the driver in cash, and we exited the vehicle. A few seconds later, I received a notification that I had been charged $79.72! Uber informed me that there was a ""surge charge"" (which I had never heard of) and that it is applicable, essentially when there are very few drivers available, relative to the number of riders needing rides. Supposedly, the rider is notified of the surge charge before accepting or rejecting the ride, but I wasn't. I was simply told ""$21.xx"", then charged $79.72.",0
"I am about sick and tired of Uber and I am just going to cancel all use with them. This is the second time that they have charged me for something without my permission. This ride was $48!!! Why do they do this?! What makes them think that someone wouldn't notice such a chuck coming out of their account?! This is the weekend and I have plans, what if that was all I had to even grab a bite to eat?! Uber is making me sick now and I am so tired of the run around with them. The first time they tried to say it was just an ""authorization"" if it is just an ""authorization"" WHY ARE THE FUNDS COMING OUT OF MY ACCOUNT?! This time, they haven't even replied yet. If those funds pull out of my account, there's going to be a huge problem! PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOU TIME WITH THEM AND DO NOT KEEP YOUR ACCOUNT ON THE APP, THEY WILL ROB YOU!!!",0
Uber is one of the worst cab provider... every time I face some problem... last time was driver did not come even after several phone calls and finally I had to pay phenality for that... I simply deleted the app,1
"I tried to schedule a trip for Sunday. When I went into the app to schedule a ride, it immediately dispatched a driver. I pressed cancel on the app several times with no results. I then saw who the driver was and called her. She thanked me and didn't come. 5 minutes later, another Uber driver came. He cancelled the trip after hearing my issue asking that the customer not be charged. Two minutes later another driver came. I then was charged a cancellation fee.",0
Tried driving for them going on two weeks still waiting on the decal I ordered twice. By time it comes I won't be trying to drive for them. Guess it's better then a two week wait from lyft on a background check. Not worth it. Y time you get everything it's the same as waiting 2-3 weeks at a new job for a paycheck.,0
I ordered an Uber and the driver picked up the wrong riders. I contacted Uber and received a notification that I would receive a refund and they never gave me my refund and no one has gotten back to me no matter how many times I have contacted them. They acknowledged that someone else took my ride but still didn't refund the money. Horrible customer service. Or lack there of.,1
7/29/2018 Have you as a driver tried to get app support when urgently needed.....forget it!!!! At least lyft has phone support that can be accessed within minutes.,0
I was charged $80 for a 10 minute drive which would have cost me no more than $30 by taxi. I will not use uber anymore.,0
"It has been over THREE weeks now and I have been told several different times by the Uber support team members that someone from their insurance adjuster's office will contact me within 2-3 business days. This has yet to happen. My shoulder is still in severe pain and I do not have insurance to have it looked at. They just keep ignoring me. ORIGINAL MESSAGE TO UBER SUPPORT "" Hello, I was picked up yesterday (06/27/2018) at 12:04 in front of the *** in Colorado Springs, CO. I wanted to bring to your attention something that happened concerning this ride. The driver was great and got me to my job interview on time! However, when he picked me up, I had my backpack and duffel bag with me because I didn't have time to take it to my storage unit first. Well, he drove a **** which is a very large truck. As I approached the truck he rolled down the window and said that I can just put my stuff in the back of the truck. So I walked around to the passenger side and proceeded to do so. The duffel back was extremely heavy and I had to lift it up to my head and lean over holding it up just to get it into the back of the truck. Lowering the duffel bag in, I got an extremely sharp pain in my left shoulder like something tore--it knocked the air out of me. I squeezed my shoulder and tried to catch my breath. Then I placed my backpack into the back of the truck and got inside and we left. I was running late to my job interview so that was my only concern at that moment. I think the driver noticed what happened because once he dropped me off, he quickly jumped out of the truck and replied: ""here, let me get that bag for you."" Anyways, I thought it was just a minor injury and that it would be fine by the next morning. Sadly, that is not the case. I was up most of the night because I couldn't sleep on my left side at all and anytime that I turned on my side the pain woke me up. I can no longer lift my left arm above my head or reach for anything without screaming in pain. Because of this, I am terrified that this is going to interfere with any possible job duties, if hired, and/or prevent me from passing any physicals should any job require one. I am writing you this because I just can't stop worrying how this is going to affect me. I'm homeless and I need to work and it terrifies me that this is going to prevent that from happening. "" This is the same blanket email that I get from Uber every time I ask them why no one is contacting me: ""...an insurance adjuster will contact you in 2-3 business days to discuss the details and claims process... Thank you for your patients."" Now, it has been nearly a month and the pain is only getting worse. Uber just keeps blowing me off hoping that I will just go away. Well, if this pain would go away then so would I!",0
"DON'T EVER USE UBER!!!! They don't hold any of their drivers accountable for their actions and they are dismissive and unprofessional when you try to contact them to resolve an issue or complaint! I had an uber driver damage my BMW in a hit and run and uber did NOTHING to resolve the issue. They couldn't even apologize on her behalf! I had a description of the driver, her SUV, video footage from the hotel, witness statements, pictures of her car before she fled and they still can't compensate me in any way, let alone apologize! I mentioned that I had to seek medical attention and they don't show any sympathy or concern for my well-being! If this driver didn't have something to hide (i.e. drunk, drugs, weapons in the car etc) then why would she run knowing there were cameras at the hotel and multiple staff who saw her and told she was wrong and she saw me taking a pic of her SUV!? What's even more ridiculous is they don't consider their drivers as their ""employees""! Read this for yourself ""Driver-partners are considered as independent contractors and not employees. This technically means that driver partners are not employed by Uber Technologies, Inc or one of its respective company subsidiaries. Also, please be advised that the Incident response team is the sole entity in charge of handling all accidents and property damage claims. All claims that we handle are processed based on facts, reason, and logic. This being said, some customers that are emotionally invested in the situation can take this as a lack of empathy. Their need to be heard and understood will often outweigh their ability to focus on the details of the problem. Lastly, if you would want to directly speak to our CEO you need to find a different channel to do so as we are unable to cater to your request. I trust I've been able to explain our position clearly."" Ps. Pray you don't ever get in an accident with an uber driver in vegas because the useless cops and laws here will allow these drunk/high uber drivers commit crimes!!!! LVPD doesn't give a fck about driving under the influence. FCKN UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!! FCK UBER AND CAN'T WAIT FOR THESE FCKS TO GET THEIR DAY IN HELL AND GO BANKRUPT!",0
"The first (and last) time I ever used Uber, the fare estimate was $61. When I logged on to book a car, I got a screen that looked like upgrade options, the lowest of which was $89. There was an option to ""Skip this Step"" so I did. I never got a screen telling me my total or asking me if I agreed to book it or not. Just that the car was on its way. The car that arrived was a huge SUV that could probably seat at least 8 people (I was alone and had one small piece of luggage and a backpack), and when I looked at the receipt later, I saw that they charged me $150 for this unnecessarily huge vehicle. When I wrote them about it they claimed I submitted a different destination location, which is entirely untrue. And they were so cold as to not even give me a break as a 1st time user, refunding at least some of that outrageous total. Terrible company in my experience.",0

"I used Uber for the first time while in Italy. Tried two times to find my drivers. They had my hotel name. I was waiting outside for them. One driver never showed up. The other was late. Said he was waiting for me down the street. I Cancelled. Uber then charges me 20 euros for two rides that never happened. It took a "" act of congress"" to get a refund. They don't have customer service phone support. Just email and a self help system that has pre- chosen choices for you to pick regarding your problem. Then It directs you to a AI type system which is no help. Until this multi million dollar company decides to invest in real phone support with a real C.S agent, I'll never use them.",0
"This is a review of what it is like to be a former contractor. First of all, I did apply to be a driver for Uber when I was driving for Lyft. However, my car and I got tired of driving people around and decided to go into another job. Anyway, I deleted my driver account from their app and delete it. Several years later when my license was about to expire. I get harassing emails from them to update their records to update my driver's license. I have already updated my driver's license but I am not going back to their website to do that. Instead, I went to their website to unsubscribe from mailing list. The next day, I get another reminder. Again, use their useless unsubscribe link to get my email address from their email list. This went on for two weeks straight when the website claims that their removal of email process takes 10 business days. Well, my birthday come and went (the day my license expires) and guess what email I got from them? You guessed it: update your expired driver's license on their website. Forget that! I have blocked them from my email account so I will not hear from them again (cross your fingers on that).",0

"They did it twice. They overcharge. Last month some driver charged me 390 when it was showing 298. He said in mine it showing this, when asked to show he said you check it again. But since my sister had booked it and I did not have the phone agreed and paid. I did not all her for somepersonal reason. But last night I was a fool I did not call my sister to confirm. The driver named swapnil picked me up from matunga at 9.45 and dropped me at powai. His car was from panvel. He was going to go without a passenger once I get down. The bill shown was 317 and he charged me 450. I gave him since I was in a hurry, instead I should have called my sister and confirmed. But is this ethically right? If I want to spend much money no matter how small or big the amount is I will do it all my will. I do not want such thugs around. Everytime overcharging. Regards Dhanada",1
My friend spent her 21st birthday clubbing and by the end of the night she was puking. Our Uber driver came to pick us up knowing we had a night of partying and a sick friend. On our drive home he stopped to let her puke. However she did puke on the outside and made a small mess in the car. After our trip I cleaned up everything inside it car as quick as I could. Then a week later we were charged with $150 for cleaning along with the charge of the trip for a very very minimal amount of puke on the seat belt and the outside of the car. We gladly would have paid 50 dollars for clean up however no matter what way we spun it definitely didnt cost 150 dollars to clean a car. He knew when he responded to our Uber need that we would be drunk. If he didnt want drunk people he did not need to respond. We will be sticking with lyft from now on.,0
Don't use UBER!!! They are spamming me and stealing personal information they do not have permission to and worse... wont do anything about it. I can't imagine what info they are taking from those who have their app or actually signed up with them!,0
Uber is a big fraud . I live in Qatar and visited US where I booked uber on 31st May . I got update on 13 June that I have been charged 150 dollars for cleaning. I was with my colleague and it was only 4 minutes trip and no mess has happened They are big fraud . Big time fraud,0
"Friday -- June 8th, 2018 -- Uber SUCKS Big Time !!! This has happened last year also. Today, early morning, I loaded another $50.00 on my Uber Account (but the app did not even show the two cards I loaded, or my previous balance, which was almost $100.00), around 7:00 a.m.. Around noon I tried to get an Uber Ride, but the Uber app would NOT acknowledge me !!! The app kept asking me if I wanted to open an Uber Account, but I already have one, and I know my log-in perfectly. There is NO Customer Service phone number or E-mail Address !!! WTF kind of Customer Service is that !!! Uber >>> YOU SUCK Big Time !!! I wanted to use up my Uber Credit, but I cannot depend on Uber to even get a ride !!!! Late for work, late for doctors appointments !!! >>> Lyft will continue to be my BEST ride service !!! Uber gets a Big FAT >>> Zero Rating . Get your act together Uber >>> You SUCK !!! Last year the same thing happened when I tried to get a ride, but Uber app did NOT even acknowledge me !!! I had over $150.00 (US) on my Uber account, but could not get a ride. Error message said something was wrong with my bank account, but there was nothing wrong with my bank account !!! >>> Uber Sucks Big Time !!! The absolute WORST Customer Service in my life (and I've seen some pretty bad customer service) .. They have NO Customer Service !!! Can't get any worse than that, can you !!!",0
A friend of mine was drinking to much and needed a ride. I tried to use uber to pick her up . The app no longer allows you to change the pick up point . It was horrible my friend ended up walking drunk on a dark country road for over a mile before I could pick her up .They have no clue as to why people need taxi service . and are so user unfriendly . I downloaded Lyft at least they have a clue,0
The driver never showed up even though he messaged me he would be here in 25 min. I had to search the site and hours later it said driver cancelled. They are a joke of a business.,1
"Has a driver with Uber you can except more bad rides. The driver make very little and the company treats them like crap. Harder then a route canal with a dentist with shaky hands to get help. I did this part time and as a Manager of drivers in my other job, I can tell you if i treated them the way Uber does I wouldn't have any and wouldn't have a job.",0
"I recently took an Uber ride and something seemed very ""off"" about the the driver so I wrote down his name and searched online for him and found his FB page on which he posted numerous videos discussing how he and his girlfriend are homeless and living in their beat up 10+ yr old car ,which is the one he uses to Uber,which is sad and indicates that driving for Uber is not a great career, but he also discussed that he takes numerous anti psychotic medications.as well as that there is a protective order against him.! I do not think this person should be driving the public around and Uber should do a much better job of choosing who they hire to do so.I would not feel safe using their service again.",0
"My daughters Prom was Saturday May 19th, I scheduled a Uber Black SUV a week before the Prom to pick up her and her date. At the very last minute we received a message saying there were no SUV's available. We tried for almost an hour to reach someone to get a vehicle. This ruined my daughters Prom, we had to ask a neighbor if they would mind taking them to the Prom. I find this to be so unprofessional. They ended up getting to the Prom about 1 1/2 hour late, missed meeting up with some of their friends to take group pictures. Never once have we received an apology for ruining my daughters special night. I would think twice about scheduling an Uber for any occasion.",0
Ive been using Uber for a few weeks and I noticed several charges to my credit card for Uber trips Ive never taken. Now my account has been frozen while my credit card companys fraud department investigates. Uber literally has NO customer service.,0
"Visiting Canada but drivers can't speak English so theres an immediate communication barrier which is not good in a foreign country. The driver never looked for me; 2 minutes are up. I tried to cancel, then found him. He didn't take me but was billed anyway. 2 minutes is never enough time to identify a drivver. No signage on their cars.....terrible service. Beware. Bad business model. Take a taxi instead.",1
"As a driver I thought Uber was a great company ,until I was in an accident. That is when you will find out what a lousy company they really are.Because you are using you own vehicle they suspended my account did absolutely nothing to help me get back on the road or assist me in getting a rental car. Uber non customer service is a real joke they where a useless piece of garbage.They have a 1000 dollar deductibe you have to pay to speed up the process and they tell you the will go after the other carries insurance company.It will be 20 days before my car is fixed.",0
"HUGE WARNING TO UBER USERS!!! I will never use UBER again - every time I tried to add my home address, it would find it on the map and then when I would try and add it to my favorites, it kept adding a different address with the same street name in Toronto. I live north of Ottawa 4.5 hours away!!!!!!!! but that wasn't clear from their app because on the list of favorites it only shows the street name and not the town. When I first got in the Uber car, the guy went WOW , you want a drive from here to Toronto... that's 4.5 hrs. He had to manually enter the address in his system. then when I selected a 15% tip at the end of the trip, it calculated it on a fair for the original 4.5 hour trip. the $62 flashed by and I said wait a minute..It can't be that much?? He should me that the fair was $14 on his system and Uber only adds 20% so it will be less than $20. I said are you sure? He said yes. I felt dumb because it was only the second time I had used Uber so got out. After he left, I double checked my phone and saw that yes the fair was $20 but a tip of $62 was added even though I chose the 15% tip option. It must have calculated it on the original 4.5 hour fair. Now they will only give me a credit on my Uber account and NOT a refund on my card. On top of that his car was old and rattled although he was nice enough. the whole experience was bad. BEWARE!!!",0
I am uber driver uber just think about own company no support drivers plz think about then start uber its bull $#*! company,0
"I would never use UBER again. Driver was unprofessional he took wrong direction tried to drive me to other state. UBER charged me for that services I never used, I tried to contact them but no one returned my money back for that services I never used but they charged until i contacted to my credit card. I really disappointed and i would never use UBER again. I would suggest people to think twice if they need such a service.",1
"Uber takes the WORST routes! They will take you in circles, then bring you back to your starting point to pick up another rider to make $2. LYFT is no better! Cant wait for more competitors to join the market. Maybe then theyll take their customers best interests into consideration.",0
how about I took uber about 6x and got a vehicle and uber continue to charge my credit cards that was on file. They have no real contact information so I am filing a claim against them for my money I dont care if it only 16 dollars....I believe in fairness and honesty...so I am filing....they arent helping the customer but instead cheating the customer.....and yet would have so questions on their site stating pick one you were drop off at the wrong location or your driver was lost no and no you took my money in my account when I didnt use you at all. Thanks and you have a good day@#$%^%$,0
"Driver got lost , could not find us. He was dressed like a junkie, Made U turns, drove us unsafely in an old, dirty car. In the end we were overcharged. Next time we were in Chicago, we just booked through a local limo company with great service and reasonable prices",1
Try to contact anybody on Uber either by phone or the internet. These idiots that run Uber do not realize that they can also go under. Nobody is too big to fail. I can do without Uber. They can go to hell.,0
"The drivers constantly cancel and charge late fees. Customer service is only reachable through the app (no phone #), and they're useless. The little money potentially saved isn't worth the hassle, from what used to be an OK company and idea. SMH.",1
"I've already left a bad review on the app but since their a Trump supporting company and to stupid to know how to make their crap work I can't edit it. I'm a traumatic brain injury person who almost fell 3 times on my way home because they can't give you a proper estimate of their drivers and I had to walk home in below freezing temperatures without a jacket. Their app is just bloatware and they think just because they support the illegitimate president they are safe from public opinion! If you are reading this and have a android, do yourself a favor and get the lyft app!",0
"it would be a bit unfair to many other great uber drivers i have met but i was getting really angry after some of the drivers cancelled my trips. damn, they are suck. seriously, my stupid drivers were $#*!ing crazy. he called me to ask me where i was, i told him the pick up point i was standing at but because i was in the other side of the road, i tried to tell him that but he talked to me in his broken english with an aggressive voice. he didnt even notice the name of the streets i tried to tell him and misheard what i was saying. he hung up the phone without saying anything and i realised that he was in the wrong direction and i tried to contact him but he didnt pick up the phone. after a while he cancelled my trip. suckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk. i am too sick of these types of uber drivers. plz recruiting and tracking your driver selectively.",1
In Salt Lake City my destination was changed after I entered uber car. I confirmed with uber driver my requested destination at my pickup location. Then again when he passed the street I going to. He took me to the location on app that I had not requested. I jumped out of the car fearing for my life. Do not drive off with any car service without seeing your requested destination on their app.,0
Ubers refund policy is a joke; dont waste your time. I had a very legitimate claim and Uber has been sending me back and forth numerous emails for just 16 dollar and they will just play you around. I always thought Uber is a reputable reliable company until today when i tried the service and realized how much they are fraudulent and their site designed to steal people money.,0
"Used Uber Eats 1 time in Atlanta GA, now my card has been used for other transactions to Uber. No way to let Uber know the possibility of their drivers selling credit information. Will never use this service again!",0
DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE YOUR CREDIT CARD. I set up their app just so I would have it handy and had to give them my credit card to do so. Months later I got a charge from them even though I never used them. I called their customer service and got a recording saying the number was out of service. I called the number from my credit card charge and was told to leave a message on their web site.,0
"I waited over 20 mins for 3 different uber drivers. I got charged the cancellation fee because my stupid driver cancelled on me as it looked like on the app he was getting lost. He made like 3 u turns on the street before giving up and said I never popped out for my pickup. I'm on a public st by the bus stop. Other people were getting picked up by uber on the same corner I was and they all got their rides faster than me. The reason why uber didn't return my refund is because it past the 30 days which I understand but I didn't get my notification until it was too late and on top of that they said the fee is to compensate the driver for his time spent driving to my location. Are you kidding me? Driver never showed up. He most likely picked up another rider on the way. I was at a crowded baseball event. If we can track the driver on the uber app, uber should be able to track to see if the driver ever arrived to the pickup location. What a joke.",1
The worse company EVER! A GROUP of thieves. Was a complete nightmare That I went through. I booked to Canada from Orlando and they sent me to New York. I found out when the confirmation came. Took over 2 hours on the phone been hang up. And I couldn't have my money back on time. DONT EVER USE THIS COMPANY,0
"Shortly after opening a Uber account, I was fraudulently charged for a Uber ride. My daughter uses and suggested how safe it is. I was in Florida boarding a plane to Wis, I received a call from an individual who asked ""where pick up"" in very broken English. I told him i was boarding a plane and did not request, or need a ride. When I landed in Wis, to my dismay I was billed for a Uber driver driving from Wis airport to my Daugher's house. I was shocked! I immediately tried to contact Uber by phone. Only to find there is no way to contact Uber by phone, even in emergencies! I even had airport police assist to no avail. I then went on Uber website to file request for refund. After numerous emails and providing supporting info to Uber customer support, the refund was denied. Uber position was a driver drove from airport to my daughter's house which I had in Uber favorites with No Rider! Really scary!! My daughter is concerned after I told her. I also provided a phone # and requested Uber to call to no avail. After denial by Uber, I did file a formal request with American Express, and provided same info and support as to Uber. After reviewing, to my relief, AE placed charge on hold and put a perm stop on any future fraudulent charges being submitted by Uber.",0
"I happened to book an uber ride, driver accepted the ride. Even after 15 mins i din't see car moving around. I tried calling the driver, he didn't respond. I messaged on uber app, mentioning the address and asking him if he is going to pick me up? Driver cancelled after 5 mins or so!!! i was stranded with no where to go!!! this is ridiculous. Again uber charged me cancellation charges when driver cancelled the ride? This driver has 5* rating!!! When i reached uber customer service asking me to compensate as i have wasted 30 mins bcos of driver, uber says "" Its ur problem and drivers, we can't take any responsibility for driver actions!!"" Why customers are charged cancellation charges when we cancel even after 2 mins, here driver cancelled after 15 mins!!! Uber is a ridiculous company which is misusing customer data and leveraging the loop holes!! Uber should be banned in US and every customer whose personal info is leaked should be paid compensation!! Uber tracks every movement and claims its to improve trip experience!! My suggestion is first do a proper driver orientation and back verification, which will definitely improve customer experience!!! Notice that if anyone has lyft and uber, uber price is lower, but if ur using uber alone they hike the price.... they do a predatory pricing!!!",1
Uber drivers need to retake their driving test because they can't can't drive. You guys get confused with directions too much. Uberpool rips off customers to make the most bang for there buck. I was literally late for work cuz we had to pick up some bozo in the opposite direction. And UberEats some B!@#$ ate my apple pie I ordered. Im not gonna go into details about that tho! Boycott Uber,1
"This morning, I had three charges from the UK (Uber Eats). I receive notifications about purchases per charge, as I was also involved in the Equifax breach. I'm assuming that my Uber account was hacked, as three orders were placed, and my credit card information is saved. I even got a call from a +44 country code, which is the UK, asking where I was and how to deliver my food. To top it off, my card was expired, yet Uber still authorized the charges. I canceled my card with Capital One and wrote two separate emails to Uber. I have YET to receive a response, which is pretty terrible - especially considering the breach that they neglected to tell everyone about not long ago. I like Uber, but will seriously be considering whether I want to trust Uber with my information.",0
"All I can say is if you enjoy being yelled at, sword at, insulted, threatened, having advances made at you, spending 20 min to make 5 min trip because the driver has zero navigational skills, have to rebook your trip several times because drivers keep cancelling, being over charged and double charged then Uber is the ride company for you. I would rather freeze walking to work in -30C weather than get into another Uber.",1
"I like the convenience of Uber, and have been a loyal customer for a long time. HOWEVER, when TWO of their drivers cancel on me within minutes, and then the PRICE GOES UP for the next one... I'm not a happy camper. I used to refer all of my friends to this service, especially the ones using Lyft.... Not any longer. $#*! this service, their drivers that were disrespectful on the phone with me... My business and my friends' business will go elsewhere. Thanks Uber, for your killings, lack of customer service, entitlement and garbage program. Byyyyyeeeeeeeeeeee.",1
UBER treats their drivers with disrespect and essentially scams drivers into investing more time and money than the company pays. Much better driving companies out there,0
Iam really disappointed with uber charges!! For the last 2 months have been calling uber in different routes but unfortunately when I agree with charges uber declares for a journey in the end I get a higher charge of $3-$5 without any explanation!! Only todays trip where I had limited funds on the account my charges had no issue!!! This is cheating!!!,0
Uber is a big fraud.. They charged me with double money.. My money was cut from pytm also and my driver also asked for the money.. For the same there was no positive response from the uber customer care ...dont try it... It is a big cheater..,0
"I was a pretty loyal Uber customer until my last trip. I open the app and the only three options are 1) wheel chair accessible, 2) uber cab and 3) Spanish. 1) I 100% feel for all handicapped and accept that there are options for them. I think it's great. Should it be the first option? No. Should there be a setting on the app that says the car needs to be handicapped accessible? Yes. 2) Why on earth would I call a taxi when I'm particularly calling uber to AVOID taxis????? The cost of uber cab makes absolutely zero point in calling an uber. It's more expensive! 3) Why in the $#*! do we have a Spanish option when we are in an English speaking country? There wasn't an English option when I was in Croatia using Uber recently. Nor did I expect it. $#*! UBER I WILL NEVER USE IT AGAIN.",0
"Uber is frud , uber driver charged double amount from me on 20/10/2017. I was traveling from Thane to vikroli. I checked amount was Rs 176. After dropping me he charged Rs. 470. About this problem I discussed through sms but no positive response from customer care. They are not even return my money. Driver create show on the road so I paid money. But customer care people are also frud people. They don't want to resolve the Issue My suggestion is don't go With uber. They don't even have contact number. They are cheaper and cheater",1
"I received e-mails from Uber asking me why I do not take Uber anymore. There is no way to reply to - they only SEND emails, they DO NOT ACCEPT e-mails. 1. AUTOMATED customer service is the biggest problem of Uber. That is the first reason for which I stopped taking Uber. I tried to call Uber when in need. I found with difficulty a number on the web. I called it and a stupid message said: ""Don't bother leaving a message, there are 20,000 messages in this mailbox"". Whoever left that message was a major $#*!, Probably Travis Kalanick or one of those cocky bastards that Uber has plenty of. 2. Uber VERY POOR customer service has cost me $ 650. In May 2016 I forgot my new iPhone ($650) in the Uber and there was NO WAY to retrieve it - there is NO Uber phone customer service where one can talk to a live person and explain the problem. That's a big flaw. I called Uber automated customer service from a hotel and never received an answer. I e-mailed multiple times, I left feedback over the Uber website. I received a response only TWO DAYS afterwards. Of course, TWO DAYS afterwards my iPhone was long gone. That is why Uber poor customer service has cost me $ 650. Uber has not offered me any compensation for that - and THE SAME THING can happen again. 3. The cars are often dirty. I initially switched from taxis to Uber because I cannot stand taxis that are dirty and smell of food because the driver eats in there. However over time the Uber has started being just as bad. There is no quality control of car. I have had dirty Uber cars, or banged up Uber cars or drivers that couldn't follow a GPS and took much longer than they should have. The dirtiness is by far the biggest problems. In contrast, Lyft has CLEAN cars. It enforces cleanliness. 4. I do not care about the negative press that Uber has had. However, I do care very much about: - the car being CLEAN, with NO FOOD SMELL - the driver that knows how to drive and follow a GPS. - your having an ACTUAL customer service. It is impossible to e-mail Uer - though uber DOES send email to you. Until Uber solves these problems, I will no longer take Uber cars. I will go to Lyft and other competitors, every time.",0
This guy is the worst Uber driver I have ever met he doesn't even show up when asked to be picked up do not let him drive you anywhere,1
"If you are in the Philadelphia area and your uber driver is Daemon, cancel it real quick. When she picked me up she was at the wrong address so I had to literally walk a 1/2 block to her car and when she called me to ask where I was at, she was rude, even though she was at the wrong house! Her car smelled very bad (musty and dirty clothes) and it was dirty! She had water bottles on the floor and crumbs on her seats. I couldn't even dust them off because of the kind of seats she had. So I sat in crumbs the entire ride to work. When it was time to drop me off, she was at the wrong location once again and I had to get out and walk a block to my building. She is by far the worst uber driver and I have had some bad drivers but she is flat out terrible.",1
"I was late for my work and appointment because driver's cancelled it for no reason, my place is easy to find so I wondered why they kept cancelling my trip. I had cancelled many times...it's not funny anymore "" Uber"" . I am almost done with you ""uber"". This company Sucks! I've been nice to all your drivers even if sometimes some of the uber driver's stinks I was still polite towards him. Now I download Lyft and will try it. Thank-you Uber!!!",1
I've drove Uber for several months last year. I haven't drove for them since I found a good paying job but as of now could use the extra money for holidays. I've been trying to log back into my active account but had no luck retrieving a varification code since I no longer have the same phone/number. I've tried numerous times to contact them about this but with no luck. Every message I send are returned saying I cant reply to that email. & when I go to the website for Uber help I stil get no results back.,0
"Uber accepted a prebooking for a 5 a.m. pick up to the airport with a quote of $32 base price plus taxes. An e mail stating that surge pricing was in effect was sent just as the driver arrived. We were already in the street. There was no time to cancel and book a limo so we got in. As a result, our fare was augmented to $126. I complained and they reduced it to $114. I am still fighting for a fair settlement . Today I took a cab.",0
"Worst experience of contacting Uber customer care. I left a sunglass and called within minutes of dropping, however they failed to connect the driver immediately and later sends an email saying they didnot find anything. This is ridiculous and highly unethical.",0
I do not recommend this business to anyone. This company is fraudulent and withdrew without my permission 455.39 from my checking account. If you have kids and bills don't use the uber app or service. I use my card online often and this has never happened to me before I rate this company a big fat zero.,0
"I have been a loyal user of Uber and it has always been my go-to means of getting from point A-B. But today, I've officially withdrawn and deleted their app. Heres why: Two nights ago, I've ordered a cab for my girlfriend to get home after a huge argument around the time of 3 a.m. Keep in mind her phone died at the time. Her destination was from Manhattan to Brooklyn. The next day, she had told me she was dissatisfied with a pool customer who gave her an attitude and told my girlfriend to ""shut up"" after talking to the driver named Raja. She was tremendously upset to begin with and it caused her to get off the car a few blocks later, which took her to the 1 train. We are super easy going people and we have discovered the driver Raja, has NEVER ended the trip at the time she was dropped off- which was only 5 blocks later and had fully taken advantaged of the circumstances and drove an empty passenge car to her destination in Brooklyn. I did not fully realize this until it was too late - so I had rated him 5 stars before I got the chance to report him. Again we were in an argument so we didn't not talk until a day later. First of all she and I were not drunk at all. And I have reached out to uber and they have refused to refund me for the amount of $27. Although the money is not the issue but the dishonest driver. I will be going to Lyft from now on. I do not regret my decision. Also I notified uber and told them the details and these illiterate workers reviewing my complaint do not even respond to the problem but are confusing that I want a refund because the fare amount itself is wrong. I regret to say that Uber hires lousy drivers that take advantage of customers at 3am. and if they had looked into my transaction profile, I already spend quite a lot for cabs, theres no reason for me to go beyond for 27$ unless it was the truth",1
"I have had several instances recently where I go to order and Uber tells me it's 2-3 minutes and then I confirm the order and it's 8-10 minutes (tech glitches). I have also had drivers who can't speak English and I must tell them where to go despite them having their map app on their phone available to them. Incompetent drivers and failing technology are not ingredients for a good user experience. When notified of their failings, Uber curtly replies that they work hard to provide the best user experience. Really, that's your best?",1
"My husband signed up for Uber online and schedule a pick up time to get the car,which was at 5:00pm at the office (location 04644)1398bryantstreet94102. we arrived 30 minutes before the scheduled time. People have been here since 11am and were exhausted. So we thought being as they closed at 5:00pm,we probably wouldnt have to be here as long. It's now after 6pm and I had the time to write this review. Not only are we waiting for the longest, but every time we asked questions regarding the cars,no one seems to know what's going on. One of the workers said he's already off the clock and that he couldn't help. We further asked to speak with the manager and she was more unprofessional!!! She literally got pissed at one of the customers then claim ""she's doing us a favor"". I couldn't help but to let her know how unprofessional and very out of order she is...but she continued and even got mad at me also and shouting in her native language. DON'T COME HERE!!!",0
"I used Uber 6 times and twice They cancelled my order and charged me a $5 cancellation fee both times but it was Uber who cancelled, not me. There is no customer service so they just pocket the money. $10 is all they will ever steal from me.",1
"I will and always have admitted, it's not about loyalty but business. I supported uber in the past because they were getting the job done better than the cab companies. And in a sense they are still more efficient than the dying breed of the cab industry. However there are and will continue to be more rideshare business. Look what Napster did to the music industry and look where Napster is now? Uber has gone down hill for me as this whole rating thing has gotten out of hand. I am on time for my driver, respectful (treating them the way I want to be treated), and despite not liking the tipping I still do it. I don't like the rating as it's pointless. If I give the driver a bad rating legitimately they will and have rated me poorly. Anything less than a 5/5 for a driver is ""wrong"". So the passenger gets bullied into giving them a perfect score. Then there is this tipping which I have been in the service industry and support it but UBER was all about the no tipping and now if you don't tip enough or worse on time, the driver rates you poorly. Personally, I don't care if a drive likes me or not but when my rating can impact me getting a ride, this is where the problem is. Some examples I dealt with is I had a driver in Montreal who didn't speak English and I did the best I could to communicate in French and so my rating goes down. In Phoenix, my driver was soliciting his private driver business and when I couldn't use his same thing. And most recently in Seattle one driver was so depressing talking about how she has no friends and that she doesn't know Seattle well. I had to end up using my own gps using international Data and yet now I get a bad review. I was scared to give this lady a 4/5 yet alone worse. And I have gained other example. I have supported UBER coming to Calgary and Edmonton, even when they were booted out temporarily. Now that I live near Vancouver, I was supporting them coming there as well. Now, I'm starting to change my mind. My point is now I'm considering going with other options including the awkward hailing of a cab! Regardless, ride sharing will continue to grow, the question is, will UBER be a part of this or eventually not exist like Napster, being just another company that started a trend? FYI they make it hard for you to contact them with complaints unless you say you were in an accident.",1
"My son booked me an Uber to take me to the station to catch a train to the airport. When I got in the driver started going at about one mile an hour and drove up loads of little side roads, going round in circles in completely the wrong direction and wasting a good 15 minutes. When I told him I had a train and flight to catch he suddenly said he was looking for other customers because it was a shared ride. I rang my son who said it definitely wasn't shared and to tell the driver to get a move on. He refused to. I asked could he then change it to unshared and charge the extra and he said no. I asked him to call his superior and he said there was nobody there to call. I explained that if I missed the one train an hour I'd miss my flight and there wasn't another one for seven days. Effectively I'd lose my whole holiday. He shrugged and carried on at one mile an hour. There was nothing I could do and even if I'd got out of his car he'd taken me down such quiet roads there was no chance of finding another cab. This was 3am in the morning and eventually after much screaming on my part he gave up looking for sharers - but I made it to the station with two minutes to spare and had to to try and run up numerous platform steps with two pieces of heavy luggage. I will never forget the experience and will never ever use them again.",1
Warning uber is a scam and there is no customer service and there drivers are drunks and drug addicts and sexual harassment,1
First of all you can't talk to anyone at Uber because they do not have phone support. After I finally found the online support team I asked why I was getting charged a monthly fee. I never opened an account with them. They did not know and continued to charge me even after I told them to stop. Instead my monthly bill got higher. They asked me to prove they were billing me by sending them screen snapshots and the last four of my credit card. Can you believe that? I had to prove to them that this was happening. So I did and then they asked me to give them the first 6 numbers on my credit card. Which I did. This company is either very incompetent or corrupt. I will never use their service!,0
"My granddaughter and I ordered an uber from santa monica beach pier . Three drivers cancelled and I was charged for the third one with them stating that the driver waited over 2 minutes for me. I was at the pickup point long before I ever contacted this driver. He evidently left and charged me with a cancellation fee and I followed the rules. Uber has shown to a very shadowy company from the get go. From now on, I will be a customer of Lyft! I have disputed this with the BBB, no response from uber so now I am making you aware.",1
"Terrible experience with Uber service today. The rider Roger, Chrysler 300, 7LHV109 accepted my ride request but never showed up and ignored my calls and text messages. My App showed he was sitting near a shopping plaza a mile away instead of picking me up. After 35 minutes in the heat, my cell phone died and I had to take a taxi. Terrible service! And Uber charged me money for its driver's failure!",1
"I was picked up from my workplace on 30/8/2017 at around 8:56 pm by cab no. TN 07 CE 8554. The trip started on my account but the drivers account was not updated. navigation kept directing the driver to my pick up point. finally after taking a full circle and wasting my time he called up customer service. the executive directed him to cancel my ongoing trip and ask me to book another assuring that the same cab will be assigned. the driver cancelled and when i booked again i was assigned a ride 20 min away. the driver asked me to get off on the street amidst a downpour. when i refused to get off away from my pick up point, while it was raining and demanded to talk to customer service again, the driver called up the office again but refused to let me speak. customer service executive told him to tell me that i am not being charged for the trip so get off. I have never seen such behavior in my life. the moment you undertake the responsibility of a trip, you are taking responsibility for our time, safety and good service delivery and in return take payment from us. you cannot waste our time, compromise our safety and then put us through discomfort and finally say 'ok we won't charge you this time'. looks like uber is no better than a bunch of scoundrels with no work ethics or standards.",1
"Worst customer service I've ever encountered. Every response is just a copy/paste canned response...they don't even read the actual complain/comment/request. I have to send my issue to them 7-10 times with multiple responses back...that's about 30-40 emails back and forth to get something as simple as a $5 cancelation ride waived because the app froze and I couldn't cancel in time. It's just ridiculous. Glad all the Sr. leaders of the company resigned or were fired. Hopefully it changes the culture, but I doubt it, all the customer service reps are nasty ass offshore peeps that don't care about anything but their ""ticket resolution"" numbers.",0

They make up accidents so that they can make more money. It is ridiculous. This is one of the worst company's to use. DO NOT USE THEM. Use lyft they are way more trustworthy and will not cheat you and take your money!",1
The drivers are rude and refuse to come at the pickup location _ Drivers Name : Kamaljeet PB 01A5756. They have an excuse of getting charged for the parking lot. as well when asked to come at pick location straight away says no. Another person in the que is Baldev with Car number,1
"The worst company I have ever been involved with.......I had driven for them for over 6 months.....Had great reviews from my customers.....I even eventually took part in their Xchange leasing program...so they were getting a double bump from me...well after learning that I really could not make enough money paying all my bills with them I had to divest some of my time to get another job....well I ended up going out of the country for 3 weeks on a potential employment trip....so fell behind on some leasing payments...I immedieately tried to communicate my situation with them and see if I could work out something...well because you cannot talke to anyone on the phone until last week...you can see how difficutl it would be to communicate my situation....after finally getting someone to talk to on the phone...they basically told me they could not do anything I needed to talk to Xchange leasing...after months of talking to a ""warranty company' which I found out was Xchange leasing in disguise...ran by a bunch of people who are not capable of having discussions about leasing issues...and continually pushing the discussion to a warranty discussion....that lead to why cant these people tell me they are Xchange leasing?...something really weird here....So long story short about 1 week of having my first discussion with an actual discussion human at UBER they come and take my car and to this day I have not had one open honest talk with Xchange leasing.......What an insult!!! Never invest your time in this company because they could care a less about the drivers, the REAL people out there bringing in the money...Oh but you will get a lot of fake pretend recordings on their call phone while you wait for hours before talking with them........I have never felt so insulted....after giving of my time to this excuse of a company...I just get mad thinking about it....and they will keep pretending they care I am sure.....................Bad Company",0
"For all there data, which is impressive, they have no idea or are just plain heartless, that taxis drive 19.1 mph. Which translates to $13.62 per hour. The same # all the other drivers mention. I am giving it up and I work mostly in the Hamptons, NY, where they raise the rate 60-70% to $22.31 per hour. People have no problem paying more ant the Hamptons rate should be the BASE rate. Basically this app sucks. I agree with a previous review that said you make pennies. Consider this, you drive 12 min to pickup, do a 5 min fare, and collect $3.67. BTW, you have no idea where you are going. So now you are 5 min further out of your way. Stay on the N. Fork (LI) and do garbage fares for $13/hr or drive to the S. Fork with nothing? Nobody tips, 8% of people. Sure it's in the app, but I could not find it for my fare in their phone. Sure you work the ""Surge"" 1.8X, wow, now you make $20 and hour and get a red light ticket/pulled over because you don't know where you are. Not to mention, you never work a surge for an hour because it disappears as you approach, they know you are coming. Therefore to make money, you turn off the app....no you don't make money or work that hour for a surge. BTW there are 1000 ubers around you at all times, watching the ants on the consumer app drives you nuts. Lyft shows you were they are at any location: another form of torture as it confirms your good spot is taken up by 23 Lyfts (which is about 60% of the Uber fleet). 3 Long hauls to NYC for a ""Bro price"" which not only includes gas, but lunch too: 2:35 hours to make $82, or 1:05 to make $80 when picked up in the Hamptons. I complained about the 82 fare, Uber said it was Kosher: sure I dropped at LaGuardia AND MIDTOWN in rush hour, no worries. Sat night I earned $296 in the Hamptons, minus gas in 10 hours. I KNOW THE HAMPTONS and have driven taxis since '99 part time. This is what a good driver gets for driving 300 miles. Every night I drive is 250-300 miles. 1000's of miles add up. Uber will get you out of a financial jam, and I will use it on MONGO nights: Concerts/Labor day, but it sucks and they have no problem having it suck for the driver, evidenced by the fares. That's all I got...oh yeah, premium/select drivers do 10% premium fares (30% of their profit), but do 90% of the base x fare. So they make....$18 per hour to pay for their Mercedes:) or grind it into dust. XL Fares are few and far in between, unlike gas stations for my Yukon. My car was a Charger 25 mpg+. NO Money in it. As the last fare said, give this up...and wait tables. I did get $210 for the puker in my car from S.Hampton, same care I put my kids in.......delete the app is what I should do.",0
Uber is a very disrespectful company they let Driver cuss you out treat you like your Nothing threw your thing's out of the car over charged customer Uber doesn't care who's driving the car or who's playing for the ride someone else was using my account information taking trip when I found out I cancel my debit card and Uber got mad and cancel my account because I want my money back Uber doesn't care about anyone they let one of there women passenger get RAPE because one of uber Driver let his friend use the car and he RAPE her Uber tryed hide the RAPE saying it was there FAULT I'm glad Uber cancel my account I don't have to worry about being cuss out or my things threw out the car or worrying about being RAPE Thank you very much Uber,0
It pays lowest wages $14/hr plus you will be using your own car. Their customer service is sh**.what do you expect from customer service people when company ceo is sh**.reffering to ceo video went viral on youtube.,0
By far Uber treats there drivers as if they are convicts on bad review or someone does not like you you will be dismissed. If an incident happens and you try to get information they automatically assume you are guilty. I was recently sexually harrased by one of my customers while driving I noticed Uber of the situation and they brushed if off basically saying it was my fault and I should have not interacted with the customer. The immediately deactivated my account without giving me any notification and then stated I was under investigation I called the company and all I got was the run around someone will get back to me. Then an email stating that my account would be permanently deactivated I was the victim but they want to keep these so called good ratings. They do not care about there drivers at all beware stay away,0
Uber charged me 3 times for a trip I took three weeks ago. Then once I wrote into help which was no help they charged me 6 more times and never replied or re-funded me my money. I had to call my bank and dispute charged and ban Uber from taking out of my account They are thief's and hope they do not last long. I have now downloaded Lyft they seem to have better service,0
Requested a Uber in Las Vegas. Was standing in front of the Uber designated pickup spot for hotel when ordered Uber. Contacted driver after waiting 25 minutes. He said I was at wrong spot hung up on me and cancelled my pickup and charged me. Uber refuses to refund that charge. I've contacted them several times and they send me the exact generic email saying no refund. Horrible customer service will never use Uber again.,0
"My first time experience with Uber was objectionable! Signed up as a first time rider with Uber under a promotion called Chase50. Offer was for 50% off for first timers for the first 2 trips thru July 31, 2017. Had a difficult time to get the first one honored and the second one was lamely refused. Their app is terrible! It willl not allow a promotion code to be accepted. Communication thru the app is rigid and tortuous and the usual 800 number in the charges description won't allow any incoming calls only refers you back to their app which is worthless. And to top it all the second driver's conduct and dress code was second rate to put it mildly. Thank goodness for Lyft which I have been using all along without any problems whatsoever. Their driver's professionalism is top rate. Even their promotions are automatic. I will erase Uber app not to use them ever again.",0
Driver Gurvinder ( car Tata Indica phone number 9041202861)in Chandigarh charged me Rs 401.51 instead of Rs 74.27.I entered the correct location and I was following the GPS till the drop off. And I was wondering how the driver changed the location because it was correct till he dropped me off. driver somehow changed it after that and charged me extra. This isn't fair- please check driver's phone or how he did it. And he didn't show me that he completed the trip and Once I got out of the car he did something on his phone. Same time I thought that something was wrong . now I can't trust Uber at all. They charged me four times the fare I was supposed to pay and they didn't even confirmed me .I was shocked to see the email of 401Rs. That's ridiculous. I have been doing lot of Uber rides but now onwards I want to tell everyone to keep a check on uber drivers in India. This is very bad experience from uber. I thought Uber drivers were honest - didn't expect this at all.,1
"First and foremost, in India there is no customer care service from UBER. There is just a help tab through which we can raise a complaint and that will be solved after 24hrs (taking their sweet time to respond). If a customer is in a deep trouble there is nobody to help. That pathetic ""HELP"" doesn't help actually. There were multiple issues I have faced with UBER. But, today it was disgusting. I got ill because of the $#*!ty freshener used in the cab. Apart from that driver had stopped the car in the middle, ended the trip and told me to get down at the unknown place because I was ill. And I was helpless because UBER has only ""HELP"" tab which doesn't work at all at the time of need. He denied to take me to the destination as he had some other work. when I insisted him he told I'll take you to the X place (where he had some work) and then I'll drop you to the destination. He forced me get down. I had to taxi from that place to my destination (Thanks to God I found a taxi over there), by the way I was charged for this trip which was equivalent to trip charge. Who is going to help in this. This is not the end yet. As the driver had ended the trip I was wrongly charged (more than what it is at time of booking) whose fault it was?? Driver was rude & abusive - UBER has ""HELP"" tab for your security. I have raised many requests on UBER ""HELP"" till now no help. One more important thing ""TIME"", nobody cares. Because of abrupt ending of the trip I reached my destination very late. Who is responsible?? This is not the first time I was wrongly charged, it has become usual. IRRITATED, PATHETIC, DISGUSTING",1
"UBER has absolute terrible customer service. Someone hacked my account but fortunately can't charge my credit card. Afterwards, I can't activate my account. After numerous emails with help.uber with numerous useless advices like resetting password numerous time... it is still a NO. After 10 days, my account still does not work and the only way to contact them is via the help.uber service site. The response turn around time is 24 hours. The worst thing is that the responses are robotic and really do not try to solve your problem. I will starting using other car service. Uber should be punished for offering such poor service.",0
"I was so upset to see the prices have sky rocketed. I went the first time to National Airport and it was under $30. This last time it was about $36 going to and $55 coming home. I couldn't believe it was so terrible. I liked the drivers and it is not their fault but I can park in a hotel garage for $10 a day and take the shuttle over. I won't use Uber again, unless it is an extreme emergency. Greed is an ugly thing. The drivers aren't benefiting from the rate hikes................ Boo for UBER",0
Constant problems in Manhattan. I get msg - that 'driver arriving now' and then nothing. And they then have the audacity to charge a cancellation fee. I am deleting this app from my phone. There has got to be a better service than Uber,1
Can't for the life of me why this man was driving so wreckless. License plate wml 7582 va. Must have been drunk. With uber stickers in the window like he worked for them. Drunk. I don't think uber would like being represented by this sicko.. teenagers drive better.,1
"I just spent 45 minutes of my life trying to simply update password and my 'Home' information on the Uber phone App. What an absolute joke. I was in a hurry to get somewhere and made the huge mistake of trying to give this company another chance... all they managed to do was to waste my time. Save time, money and frustration... use Fasten, Lyft or anybody else. This company just needs to close!",0
Uber is $#*! and crooked !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
called for uber to take us to union station from American university section of DC. initial proposed charge was for $21 then just before pick up got message surge pricing in effect. without proposed charge. agreed since too late to reschedule with other company. pick up was at 9:47 am and there was little traffic. Charge was $55.82. Fee for larger vehicle to accommodate handicap from Regan airport on return was $34 without tip. A longer trip. Contacted uber which was difficult and no remorse whatsoever. Will never use uber again as no trtust factor at all. Car was mediocre at best. not a accompany to be trusted under any circumstances.,1
I have never used UBER and never will after reading reviews and stories on the news. If enough people stop using them they will be forced to fix the problem or go out of business.,0
I booked uber but those drivers told that we are very far we won't come to pick you.up...they suggested me to cancel it and book it again...again the next driver told me the same... I will be simply charged due to cancellation... The company should check this... worst experience as I was in hurry...,1
"I had just arrived from the airport for my trip and was super excited to begin my vacation. However, my friend and I called for an Uber...which I highly regret now...that totally switched my happy mood into pure frustration and put me into the worst mood possible... My friend had took my phone to call for an Uber. The Uber driver was very poor at communicating his destination. After waiting around for a bit, we told him we were at the gate that he told us to be waiting for him after running there in a hurry. He was very short and rude in the manner in which he communicated. Once I told him we were in arrivals, he told us that he said to be departures and cancelled the ride, and Uber had to audacity to charge me for NO service! In the normal world, when people arrive at a destination from a flight, they get picked up in ""arrivals"". I tried to contact Uber, but apparently they do not have a real phone line to call customer support. Trying to get my money back was such a pain and ruined the whole start of my trip. All I wanted was my money back, and I probably would have been fine and a little irritated about the experience but probably would of still continued to use Uber if they had simply refunded me....However, they would only give me ""Uber credit"" to use on my next trip and still charged my card. I told them to remove the charge from my card, but they said that was ""against their policy"". I have talked with a few others that have similar situations happen to them, and they were able to get full refunds for their charged cancellation...but I don't know why refunding my card in particular was against their policy. Seems as if the company picks and chooses who they want to refund...which wouldn't qualify as a ""policy"". I guess they would prefer to lose a customer to a competitor than refund a simple $5 cancellation. That simple $5 costs them close to $200 in lost revenue just for that weekend with all of us using Lyft and other transportation services instead. My first Lyft ride was really great, the driver had even given us complimentary waters and protein bars and his car seats were actually cool massage chairs! Back to the point, Uber is not a good company...there are sooo many things that are wrong with them aside from stealing money from customers. They prefer employees that are greedy and will do anything at all costs to get ahead. I'm not just referring to the drivers (some have which have been nice to me on other occasions), I'm referring to the corporate dogs that devalue everyone around them. Here is a link to an article if you would like to learn more about the toxicity of the Uber culture... https://www.mediabistro.com/employer/blog/news/travis-kalanick-king-hr-fails-finally-ousted-uber/",1
I have been recently using uber cab in Prahalad nagar Ahmadabad. i have received bill amount through massage from uber cab service. The actual billing amount is Rs.49. but drivers did not agree to this amount is ok. he is taken Rs.104 from me. also driver was very rude and tourchable . i don't book uber taxi service in my entire life. So look into this and short out this issue on urgent basis.,1
Uber/Lyft drivers need to know all the facts about doing this work. Hardly anyone is making money. Uber is preying on,0
"The driver took ages to approach the location, didn't show up, cancelled my trip.. and then Uber charged me a cancellation fee. They wouldn't refund the wrongly charged cancellation fee back to my credit card. They rather hold it ransom instead, on my ""Uber account"", as if I was expected to use their miserable service ever again. They are a bunch of unethical morons.",0
I requested 4 different ubers and every uber canceled on me. Uber is a joke. If you were smart you would use lift.,1
Poor driving and texting / address look up while driving and getting into accidents with no care for others,1
"Used twice, over charged twice. I have used Uber twice. Both times going incoming, I was overcharged from what they stated the charge would be. And trying to get it straightened out, so called customer service kept sending me a form letters that had nothing to do with my complaint. In my opinion Uber is a scam. Yes you can get where you're going but they charge you at least 20% more then they state their charging. One time, they charge me three times what they stated they would be charging. It took in excess of 75 emails from me to get that straightened out. Don't waste your money, don't waste your time. Uber stinks",0
"I use Uber in China, Australia, India and UK and have found them to be reasonable up until now. I took an Uber in Brisbane recently and the driver was terrible. My female companion complained to the driver about his erratic unsafe driving in general, his ignoring of the navigator, ignoring of directions. Uber driver, knowing he would get a one star rating, then complained about us both making 'racist' remarks. I have no idea of what nationality the driver was, it was not even on my radar. My companion sits on University Boards and other Government agencies and is listed in top women business leaders, I also am on similar boards, travel extensively through Asia, Europe and India, we both have no racist comments to make, but we are immediately, according to Uber, guilty. Uber suspends account without discussion with me and then after only sending condescending patronizing emails 'about their community' as they are now also the new warrior and standard setter of community political correctness and protector of multiculturalism, supposedly 'unblocks' my account but it will not work. Despite trying several times to contact them to resolve, emails are answered, one of our team will be in touch, still waiting. Uber's arrogance knows no bounds, they answer to no one but themselves, they are not only condescending in their attitude, they make public claims which they do not back up. As they have to answer to know one except their own falsely manufactured 'community' which standards are set by a mutli-national based on profits, not moral or a code of conduct that has checks and balances denying a process for right of reasonable reply nor natural justice to their passengers. Their complaint service is purposefully designed to avoid human contact so they can make their morally one sided incoherent biased judgement in complete isolation and then make unfounded derogatory unable to be replied to judgments that if I knew who it was I would complain to the HRC. As they have no responsibility to local authority nor reasonable codes of contact and conduct, do not expect a fair go from Uber and do your best to out them as a self serving corporate usurer of community standards for their own profit motive while making false claims against real people of high standing in real communities, expose them for the hypocrites they are. Similar opinion? Write a review!",1
"DO not drive for uber eats as this company has no value for any of it so called Partners. YOu will end up paying uber to drive for them and no profits. in addition you will be stress out because they also want to rate you for a rating system that you have no control over. I started driving for uber because i was recently laid off and needed some income. Like many before me i, fell prey to their deceiving craiglist advertising that tell you that you could make up to 30 dollars and hour and that it was a fun no boss way to make money. DIN""T even come close to making minimum wage and in addition at the end of the year when i file taxes was told that i owed 1500. dollars. for taxes. SO after taxes, oil change, Gasoline, tires, and i ended up with nothing. I also tried their UBer eats was far more worse. I was waiting for over two hours to get a precious beep and after getting beep went up four set of stairs and customers don't even give you any tip. delivery fee was only 2.30 cents so after two hours. THis is what i made. In addition i did twenty hours for uber eats and made after gasoline 100. dollars far less than the minimum wage. DO NOT GET Deceived by their false adds to be your own boss and make as much. They control everything, from rating, to how many beeps, you get to tipping option which they still haven't added to their app. DO YOUSELVES a favor stay away from UBER EATS.",0
I always had a good drive with the uber. But today morning I have my exam from 9. I call the uber driver before 35 mint so that I can reach early.. And he revived my call and told me he will reach within 5mint I waited for him for 20 mint and the driver didnot turned up and I literally missed my exam.. please select some professional driver or else it will be a great loss for the Uber company..

"I spent over an hour of my personal time seeking the lowest fare to the airport following meetings in Grand Rapids, MI. I'm a government employee, and every dollar counts. Out of over 30 options reviewed, UBER was by far the cheapest at $16 from downtown. Next best was $20, and then the others hovered around $35-45. Google revealed the secret technique on how to preorder a 5:15am Uber the night before. Out of the shower I spy a circa 5:15am. text that, due to SURGE PRICING, my 5:25am fare would now be 3.5x what we had agreed to the previous evening, and I had 5 minutes (already spent in the shower) I could cancel without being charged a fee. The soonest cab ($40 fare) was 20 minutes away that I couldn't spare at this point. My $16 deal now cost $51. Cancelling Uber at this point would mean a missed flight, lost connections and expensive misery. There was nothing to do but pay whatever they asked. Sort of like breaking down in the middle of nowhere with the only mechanic being the crooked Sheriff's brother. Well played Uber! Well played! I can't help but think this is a frequently used well-planned scenario or else they would have made me aware of this surge thing the night before being a possibility. Had they done so, I would have used a stable priced cab service. I shall never use Uber again. They not only screwed me, but all the transportation providers that were cheaper than $50. I also am left with a bitter taste of my Grand Rapids experience although everything else during my visit was superb. I will never recommend Uber to a friend or worst enemy. NONE OF THIS HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH MY DRIVER. She was great.",0
Uber gives men a chance to cheat on there girlfriends or wife's. I've had it happen to me and know other women it's happened to. The guy would say I'm doing uber but really he's going to meet another women. So be care other women out that you boyfriend or husband is really doing uber and not out cheating on you. I think uber is ruining lives and destroying relationships. I think uber should be a schedule hours and should be online so many hours before getting paid or something to ensure men won't cheat.,0
"Why do you continue to overcharge rides and call it a cancellation fee. I never moved from my original site. Uber driver stopped several blocks away, then turned around and left and stuck me with a $5 cancellation fee. He cancelled me, not me cancelling him.",1
"We ordered Uber XL for our party of five. A Toyota 4Runner was assigned. It did not have seating for five plus a driver. We had to cram four in the backseat. Several emails between Uber and myself resulted in a ""too bad, it's what you ordered."" So we paid premium rate for a service we did not get. Uber XL says parties of 1-6, but beware. You are responsible for knowing if the vehicle assigned will seat the number in your party.",0
"After reading reviews by other disgruntled customers, I can see that my experience is unfortunately normal. I arrived at Manchester, UK airport around 10:30 pm and used the app to contact a driver. The app showed the driver was 3-5 minutes away but I waited 20 minutes before receiving a message that the ride was cancelled. Part of the problem was the waiting area was not clearly indicated and local police were not allowing cars to park so it wasn't easy to be met. However, I didn't receive a call and when I tried calling I didn't get an answer. I didn't give up and tried twice more since by midnight there were fewer cars but it didn't help. On one of the ride requests I cancelled within 5 minutes. Now back at home I see that Uber charged me $5 US for each cancelled ride, even the one I legitimately cancelled. I'm glad there's a forum like this to lodge a complaint but would prefer the message reached a wider audience since I now have read that Uber was given an F by the Better Business Bureau. The public should know they are scam artists !",1
"The driver pulled up and said they were cancelling my ride to the airport. The next driver informed me that they probably had a higher fare at the last minute as my fare was only $6.00. I then get charged a $5 fee? I asked for a refund to my card, but all I received was template responses stating that they will only issue a credit to my account and cannot refund to my card. I cancelled my Uber account and my wife and daughter did as well. Hope you enjoy the $5.00, Uber!",0
I have made 3 attempt to sign up to NO avail. I fully admit I am 73 but I can easily call a cab using the Web. I think and can only assume all will agree that the system should be user friendly. No wonder they have so many poor reviews.,0
"I've been trying to arrange a ride with Uber and have $150 in Uber credit. Every time I request a ride I get an error message. I contacted their help desk and after 35 emails and following all of their instructions, I still can't request a ride. They still have my $150 and won't provide a refund. They keep thanking me for my patience, but after a month of trying to use their service and them still having my $150 I'm out of patience.",0
"I live in Europe and I've started using Uber as I was traveling through middle and south america. At the beginning everthing was fine and I thought it was a great service but sadly I was proven wrong! As I wanted to go from Meddelin city colombia to the airport to take my flight to panama city, panama... I used the Uber App for the transfer and the price that was shown to me on the App was approx. $25. It was $5 more than what I've paid for a normal Taxi coming from the airport to Medellin city but I was in hurry so I took the offer. After I've arrived at the airport though I've noticed that $45 were booked from my cc by Uber for this ride, so I did what everyone would normally do and that is send a complaint to Uber about the overcharge. I did this using the Uber app. Anyhow two days later I've received an email from Uber and I couldn't believe what they wrote to me.""Your account has been permanently suspended"". So they have suspended my account permanently for sending a complaint via their App. Can anybody believe this? Well after seeing what United Airlines did to one of it's customers nothing should shock us anymore! But all I want to say here is.. we all need to always look for and use alternatives. These big companies need to have as much competition as possible otherwise they will grow arrogant and start treating their customers like trash.",0

"Today I booked with Uber and when the app showed our car was due in 5 minutes, we went downstairs to wait. 30 minutes later we were still waiting.

"I am attempting to become an Uber driver. When trying to update my profile, I get a message ""please wait"" with the spinning circle and it never connects on three different computers.

I am also working on Lyft, so far so good, their website works, at least. At this point I say stay away from Uber.",0
"I had to catch a flight from delhi so I called uber to my location but I don't know where the driver reached and he didn't even called me to ask my location instead I had to call him back when he tooked so long ,since I was getting late for my flight so I need to cancel the booking. And now I need to pay the cancellation charge when it wasn't even my fault.",1
"Try cancelling your account and find big surprises. Some of my friends thought they had cancelled their accounts along with their Credit card info. However, after hearing my problem, they checked with Uber and surprise! CC info was still there and accounts not closed. Here is what happened to me. i decided to use only the cash feature and delete my CC number. They told me I could not even though other friends have signed up for and used the cash only option(may not be available everywhere, i guess). After several days of back and forth emails to Uber I was finally told that I had 2 different accounts with 2 different CC's. one as a driver and one as a customer. I find this interesting as I don't have a Drivers License or CC, only a debit card. I am retired from Walt Disney! It is just a on-going mess, Consumers beware!",0
"In suburban Tampa, we requested a car to Tampa International Airport. The driver, Lillie, was totally rude and incompetent. The vehicle had her own personal luggage in the back, so there was no room for ours. Her comment, in barely understandable English, was that we should have said the ride was to the airport. Duh. Apparently she did not know that Tampa International Airport is an actual airport. She slammed the door and yelled that we would have to call another Uber. If you need an Uber in Tampa, be sure you don't get Lillie.",1
"This happened in Washington DC, need to get to the airport. Uber driver arrives, sees me and my family, kids, then leaves inmediately, without even saying why. Uber then charges me a $5 cancelation, charges me!!!. I don't know what to do, really need to get to the airpost, so I request them again. Another driver arrives, and does exactly the same thing. Uber does exactly the same thing of course and charges me another $5. What is this?. On top of all that, no way to contact them, worst service I've seen in my entire life. Of course I am fighting them and I will get my money back one way or another. Stay away.",1

Whys it so hard to find Darlington road.se27 0ud my satnav brings me to door .cab always on wrong road so I have to walk around roads looking for cab . On going problem.,0
"Driver never showed and had the audacity to charge me for the full ride. I paid for it, was left with no ride and super late for my event. I finally called a cab - yes a CAB which showed up, more than I can say for MARIO, Jersey City driver from hell. If you see Mario as your ride, cancel it asap. He charged me 100%, for a ride I never took. Never saw him, ever. Uber refused to credit my account,after 4 requests.. So here is how they do business: Charge you whatever they want, and never even have to pick you up or be accountable for leaving you stranded. I WILL NEVER USE UBER AGAIN! By the way, how about common courtesy for a customer who was been a loyal passenger for years, this is how they treat people. BE warned, until you face it, you won't believe it. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE whatsover. I boycott Uber and will pass the word along as many times as I can",1
"This annoying uber company keeps charging my account for trips i didnt book. They charge a non existing trip when all my family members were at home over the weekend. when nobody went anywhere, they came up with a trip charge. It was very annoying there is nobody to complain to. I was charged for a trip when I wasn't in the country for heaven sake. Many charges on my account to Uber company are pretty questionable. Once your bank details are loaded, you can't delete, this means they have access to your money anytime. Uber is a fraudulent company, I will continue to seek for justice until I see it.",0
"I waited for almost 1 hour, every time I looked the app kept giving different time updates so I waited since it was rush hour after all in Atlanta. After 1 hour I contacted the driver and he claimed to not have any record of my request and that he had already picked someone else. He kept putting me on hold and told me to take up with Uber. I will NOT use this company again, the app has been removed from my phone!",0
"I referred a friend to Uber and got a free ride. I made a ride and my free ride didn't work. When I asked Uber to reimburse me they said they'd block my account for some violation they couldn't explain. I asked questions and tried to clarify the case, and they sent me 5 (!!!) absolutely similar emails with NO answer to any of my questions. So this is how Uber support works and this is what you get for referring friends.",0
"They charging unfair money for the trips! I had 3 miles trip which is about 15 minutes and they charged me Â£15.41 pounds! When they showing how much would cost your trip on the app, it was from Â£5 to Â£7 pounds, but they charged Â£15.41!!! Liars and thieves!!!",0
App was showing me cab is 5 minutes away. By the time I come down from my building and reach my society gate. The cab was there but drive didn't allow me to seat. He said I have cancelled ur ride. He didn't even call me before canceling it. It was quite rude. Never expected such kind of experience with uber.,1
"Why the driver have to give to Uber personal information of private bank account ,l my sure they don't give company bank account information",0
I will no longer use uber tried 4 times today 4 times to request ride it kept telling me to confirm my payment which it did 5 count them 5times EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL GIVE DRIVER STUPID DIRECTION AS a company menat to serve the people IT DOES JUST THE OPPOSITE WHILE CABS A MORE EXPESIVE THEY DO NOT ON a daily basis screw up like uber does,0
"I book hotel to airport. I booked for 48sar and finally it costs 84sar when I received the email. This is more expensive than a normal cab. This is more expensive than the official cab which I took when I did the single trip from airport to hotel. Uber, you messed up, you start to be like Ryan Air!",0
Requestrd a Uber lift in Santa Monica via their app and waitrd outside Hotel. No driver to be seen. Driver cancelled and chargeme 5 dollars via PayPal. A scam!,1
"I am in Boston on business. Today, I send for Uber to pick me up after lunch at Roxy's Grilled Cheese. The first driver, accepts then 2 minutes later he cancels. The 2nd guy drives right past the restaurant. I text him to tell him he just passed by, then he cancels. The 3rd person, I text to tell her in advance that I am standing in front of Roxy's Grill. She calls and says she's there. I tell her she'e not because I'm standing outside the door (in the cold rain this whole time mind you). She says okay she'll be right there and cancels. I go back in the restaurant to tell the guy behind the counter what's going on. Recommends that I walk down to Walgreens and get Uber from there which I do after being very frustrated. Finally, someone by named Moses arrive. I tell him the story and he's very apologetic. I get back to my hotel and see that I have been charged $5 for each cancellation. I email Uber and informing them of what happened and they are refusing to credit my account. Welcome to Boston!",1
It has happened to me 3 times in a row that I had scheduled a ride and the drivers never showed up. One driver never showed up called me stating that he missed an exit both times I missed my flight to the airport. You guys have bunch of fags working for you guys can't tech on time Uber is not reliable at all because they are making so much money they don't care about their customers I submitted a complain last time no one responded me don't have any number that you can call they are just app based and have a horrible service! Driver name was NABIN driving TOYOTA VENZA plate# T694057C don't trust this driver charged me money and never gave it back. Very upset about this situation,1
We are going on vacation soon and it was suggested by our resort that uber would be less costly than a taxi. I set up an uber account. Because I did not want to store a card number that was attached to my account or use a credit card that has thousands of dollars available to use I purchased a my vanilla visa debit card. I talked to my vanilla and ask them if this would be a card I could use with uber. They assured me of the cards available this card would be the one to use. I tried several times to set up the uber account using this card and they would not take it. Not only that but the customer service people totally suck at their job. Basically I was told to bad so sad - and at no time did anyone investigate if there was a reason why you can not use this type of card. they just said sometimes they just don't work use a credit card. This type of card is used by many to receive direct deposit of payroll instead of having a checking account. One would think that uber would do some investigation to find out why there is a problem. So if you want to try and protect yourself by using this type of card don't expect uber to try and help figure it out. Worst service I've ever received. Given all the other bad things I've seen in the news lately about uber workers and the CEO this should not surprise me.,0
"So I recently decided to give this $#*!ty business and app a try. First let me say there is no one to call when you have issues. Anyway,I download my app set up my account and begin to get a driver now first, I use my debit doesn't let me no explanation just unable to use try different payment. Okay credit card. NOPE!!! Okay create my pay pal. Again unable to use payment try different form of payment. What!!! Fix your $#*!!!! I even bought a Fu@kng gift card and couldn't use that piece of crap. O and by the by the way all this time had me so damn late because I had to now take the train which if you don't know not all trains on Nj transit stop at the same locations so which an urber 25 min tops with traffic turned into 2 hours and 17 minutes. I had to get a cab which to the train from my place 20$ where the whole urber ride was 13$ then round trip ticket 16$ then another 16 more for cab from train to appt back to train. Did I mention when I got back to train from appt. Yep you guessed had to wait 51 minutes for train then over 25 min on the ride when back to Dover instead of paying for another cab I waited yep 35 more minutes for my girl to pick me up. Thanks Urber could have been dropped off at station in the morning right on time then wouldn't havre been late and after appt got picked up on time from station. But instead of using train was going to take urber because it was the same price. So I say again when your working it's great but it always has some sort of issue and no one to call you suck!!!!! Get your broken ass together and fix your issues for the future customers because you will need them you just lost one today I give you 2 middle fingers up for your performance!!",0
"Called and Uber black car to get my husband and me to DFW airport. The estimate for the premium black car was $91.00 but we decided to go for it this one time. We went the 20 miles from downtown Dallas to DFW in about 40 minutes since it was 7:00 in the morning. When I got settled on our plane I checked my account to see that they had charged me $152.00!!! I have been going back and forth with them for a week now and all I get is ""The fare you were charged is within our estimate for a trip from your pickup location to destination. As a result, the fare was not adjusted."" Even though I have told them it was NOT what they estimated, I continued to get the same reply 4 different times. I finally just cancelled my account. There was no other recourse except to now tell my story so someone else won't get ripped off like I was! By the way, the taxi ride back during evening rush hour was $50.00!!!",0
"I received a ride that was 13 miles and took less than 30 minutes. My original estimated coast was $27 the initial charge was $25. 24 hours later, I received an email stating the driver adjusted destination and my fee was adjusted to $160. I disputed the charge stating the original destination was correct. I Provided screen shot of google maps and pick up and drop addresses. After multiple emails back and forth, still no luck of Uber correcting the, what I call a, ""fraudulent charge"". Customer service is less than desirable to say the least. I have been giving the runaround. I have asked for a contact number to speak with someone live but no such luck. I am now forced to dispute the charge with my credit card company and will being filing a complaint with the better business bureau. I understand mistakes happen but failure to correct mistakes is in enexcusable. Uber not only lost a routine customer today but also gained poor advertisement from a dissatisfied customer. I will warn friends and coworkers against using Uber. To many other options.",0
Horrific experience I waited for an Uber driver for 30 minutes stupid me !!!! He kept saying he be there in 2 to 3 minute he never showed up !!!!Uber had a nerve to charge me for the ride I tried to get in contact with customer service they were nothing but rude,1
"They lie to you, cheat and steal. Do not drive for them. They will not honor what they say or owe you.",0
"I ordered an uber to get to work this morning and after 5 minutes of not moving, the driver called and said if I wanted a ride, I would need to go with him to LAX. That obviously was not an option, so I canceled. I should have insisted that the driver canceled, but lessons learned. Anyway, I was charged a cancellation fee and immediately complained. Respond #1 fored back immediately from ""SC"" saying we charged you correctly. I said no you didn't and asked for a refund. Hazel L provided me a credit, which would have been fine if that was the initial response, but since I needed to go through hoops, I demanded a refund back to my credit card. Gretchen C responded that is against policy. Mind you, I am a 400 dollar/month uber user (I used uber eats at work pretty often) so this absolutely blew my mind. I can say that uber has officially lost a user forever, I hope the company implodes with the recent negative PR storm that has hit them. Congrats Lyft, eat24, and postmates, you have a new customer!",0
We tried getting an Uber THREE time and they canceled on us each time and waited until the last minute to cancel on us. This is terrible customer service. It's honestly unbelievable. DONT USE UBER.,1
"It would be of great help if uber came up with simple terms or explained what is a uber pool while booking a cab.i booked a cab and chose the option of uber pool since that was the first available option while booking a cab.and the picture of the car for this option was a small car while the other options and pictures were of fancy cars. When the cab arrived I realized it was sharing,initially I found it a little weird but I agreed to get into the car.the sharing drop was at prabhadevi.so I insisted the driver to drop me first since Wadala comes First.the driver agreed to drop me,but later said that the route on his phone was prabhadevi so he has to drop me 2nd.I told him I would like to get down and asked him how much did it cost.He said he will only be able to tell me once my trip ends.which i found ridiculously lame.Only if uber could come up with a better solution to cancel or discontinue the service.I had a bull$#*! experience will never travel uber in India atleast.WORST experience. 1)wasted 1.30mins of my time and will also recommend my family and friends not to take uber atleast in India.",0
"I was having my 18 yr old son picked up and the driver was texting and driving and I told him not to, cancelled my ride and now my account is disabled. It gets better, Im trying to resolve my issue and they are trying to tell me that the email on file doesnt match the one in their records. I only use the one email so Im not getting any help. So I have moved to Lyft!! Screw Uber!",1
"I lost my cell phone in an Uber vehicle on a vacation to Las Vegas. Trying to track down the driver was a 12 day nightmare. Uber's doesn't really have a customer service. They have a few people available on twitter or a Uber lost item report that will eventually get a response. First Uber does not have a lost item link of their website home page or App. They also demand full rude detail, drivers name, date of trip, cost of trip, time of trip and pickup and drop off locations. So if you lost your phone, and don't have access to their app or a computer your screwed. I send various Uber contacts a minimum of 25 messages. Only when I purchased another iPhone and another SIM card from my service provider could I go through the secure process to use my old phone number and get into the app to get the ride detail. So I give them the detail that they could have looked up any time and they basically tell me that the driver has my phone and that I need to contact the driver through the app to get my phone back. Then then scolded me for opening multiple threads containing the sMe issue and sId my case was closed. I complained asking them how they could close my case when I do not have my phone back, they did not reply because they don't care. I went through their "" contact the driver"" process 7 times over 4 days and no one ever answered. Only on my 8th try did I reach the driver 12 days after it was lost in the car. Uber is an arrogant, rude company that does not care about providing customer service. The have no toll free numbers for customers and their online support is terrible. They tell you that they have sent you several DM's. I said I looked and could not find any Direct Messages from them. That's because the messages are hidden in their app under a help link. How are customers supposed to know that? I now use Lyft and they are awesome and will never ever use Uber again. I want to be very clear, the driver is not the problem, when I was finally able to reach him he was polite and very helpful. This is all Uber's rude unfriendly business model",0
Drivers are allowed to cancel for no reason and the customer is charged a cancellation fee. Is this Ubers new scam?,1
"Do you know why their overall rating is only 2+ Stars? Allow me to clarify: On Tuesday I called for a car at 10am. Without bothering to confirm my address, the driver came to the wrong place and left, without a call. Next driver cancelled, too. My first patient cancelled. Today, the driver actually CALLED for directions... and cancelled. No message from Uber, so I stood there, on crutches, in the snow, waiting. Then I couldn't connect to uber, AND THERE IS NO DIRECT TELEPHONE OR COMPLAINT NUMBER. Finally took a yellow cab. LYFT RIDE NEXT TIME. DUMP UBER AND MOVE TO LYFT. Eric Berger MD",0
"Overpriced for going small distances, treats employees awful, let's underage children order rides. Find better service they just f$#@ people all day",0
"These bastards wasted so much of my time. Declined me for joining up, then told me to go get the driver accreditation. After getting it they still declined. Kuunts",0
Working 8 hours shift then I decided to do my grocery shopping and get Uber to take me home in a snowy night. When I requested Uber it was giving me another address to go there and wait for Uber on the main road. So when I could do that with having 7 bags of shopping then I would have taken a bus for $4 rather than paying $25 for the Uber. It happened with me 3 times so I kept cancelling them and calling for capital taxi. The place where I work is a big mall and I work there and do my grocery from loblaws then always tried to get Uber but didn't work with me for the last 3 times. So I kept using capital taxi since then I was ur customer used Uber a lot. But not anymore.,0
AWFUL experience... fro OHare to home in double time! Didn't know that pool gives them the right to drive all other towns! Will not use them against!,0
I got quoted for $45 and ended up paying $64. The driver purposely drove through a $#*! ton of tolls! Stay away from Uber..esp. from DFW.,1
"We booked a taxi from Leeds to Sowerby Bridge on Saturday. Before we got In the taxi we asked how much it would cost and the driver said he didn't know and you should have an email! We did not receive any message to tell us the cost, if we had we would not of got in the taxi, it cost us 90 for what should of been a 32 trip! There were lots of empty uber taxis driving round waiting to pick people up, so the demand was not high, now I can understand d why there was, the inflated price of 2.8 is crazy and no need! I'm shocked disappointed and will not be using uber again, I do not agree with not been told the price before we got in, how can you charge someone without knowing the cost in first place! We had no choice but in to the car as it was late and cold, and we had already ordered it!",0
"Have been driving for uber for 3 weeks and they take almost half the fare and call it a booking fees and then another fare fee. They don't charge enough, they encourage people not to tip, they let passengers cancel and don't compensate for drivers time, they don't tell you the final destination until passenger is sitting in the car....I could go on and on. They use drivers to make millions but really could care less about them. Why can a passenger see picture of me but I can't see a picture of them?? So many issues that I'm shocked they are still in business.",0
Uber is thirsty for money. Even when they know they cannot pick you up within the time stated they make you wait and charge you a cancellation fee if you dare to choose another option. This company is on a downward spiral. Up with Lyft. Down with Uber. How dare you disappoint a customer during Mardi Gras season!,0
"On a recent ride there were 5 of us jammed into a little Uber car with our suitcases and the ride cost me more than the taxi I took going to the airport. Watch out for extra charges, user fees. The company is very greedy. Just imagine how much the company made off the five of us per hour.",0
Uber tempt you with a cheap fare when you request the ride only to find they charged you double to the same destination and no tolls. Also the driver cancelled the job and they still charged me. When I complained they said they refunded me but it's not true and never received any refund,0
my promos return back while i can ride my promos return back while i can ride my promos return back while i can ride my promos return back while i can ride my promos return back while i can ride my promos return back while i can ride my promos return back while i can ride my promos return back while i can ride,0
"Our 15 year old boys hailed an Uber ride late Friday night (February 24, 2017). Well.....let's just say they aided in our boys running away from home. Check out their rules, and it says you need to be 18 to call for a ride, or have parental permission! Umm....not 18, and no permission!!! Good job Uber!!!",0
I want to start off by saying I will never use uber again ! First off every time I take a trip I know the rate is a certain price doesn't matter that I go home at a certain time of the day I know it has always been this price I been riding this specific route for some time but today took that same trip & literally price said the same thing & so the price is between 15 to 16 bucks & so literally get in the uber of course & literally was having problems with the app cause there always some problem with there app & got home to my place to look & see that I was charged 37 for my ride when I was charged wrong for like the 4th or 5th time before it has happened they reversed it now they could not reverse it so in short screwed me over & now they are talking about they said I went past my location when I didn't so now I'm letting everyone know do not use uber because they are disrespectful & will not reverse me for money,0
Nothing good about uber Use  ARRO   app instead download ARRO on your phone much better then uber no surge pricing ever,0
They are not giving there service in Kanpur ... #The 11th Biggest city... Very very poor ....Why is it if they take money out of your account for the Uber rides that they have to take additional money which they say it's an authorization hold but they do not put it back for at least eight days and this is money that I cannot access and another thing if you have an Uber gift card they still want to put monies from the ride from your checking account on hold when it is confirmed that they will get paid by the Uber gift card ...I just Uber Cabs .....,0
We had a flight at SFO and uber never arrived at the time we ask to be picked up. They sent me three different messages they said that they would be 15 minutes then 35 minutes then 45 minutes. We cansal and drove ourselves and miss our flight. I sent sent my complain and they said that the driver was on time. I don't know why they could not see the message that the driver sent and at what time I needed to be picked up. Never gain I will use there service. I will never recommend them.,0
"Last nite i got a ride to the hospital.I have a bad leg,i can see hospital from my house.So i thought i would try uber this was my thrid ride i get a cab all the time he picker me up at my house.I guess he was in a bad mood that happens i understand that when we got there he charged me 7.00 my cab costs me 4.00 dollars i was robbed and when i went i was pissed i have been there 20 years and i told myy people you just lost a ton of buss every one was going to try it but not now and how do you know if my ride was 1 that got recorder for my free rides in the future. Not that i will ever use it again.You lost a lot of buss thanks captain tom 443 762 7273",1
"I have been driving only two months but done with uber. I noticed how unfair the prices, pay is so I decided to ask passangers to send me via text how much they actually paid (after they got the email with how much their actual fare was) and time and time again what I got paid based on fare was off by $1-4 on each trip! They steal from the drivers! Not only they take their 20% they take more! When you report it on each trip they come back and say oh ok the fare will be adjusted, not only they adjust it wrong but you never see that money, ever. When will that adjustment hit your account? Never! Be aware, you will pay more then 20% take, it's more like 35% most rides because if like the passanger pays $10 in reality they paid like 13-14$!",0
So I rode about a week or two ago and I had a few hour drive . Was already costing me enough and I was disrespected due to being trans and the driver stopped on the way never stopping the meter so I was charged extra . Wrote uber and they said they can't do nothing but say sorry and have an good day . Wrote in over and over and there just like again we can't give you credit or anything have an good day Useless and an waste of time Never suggesting them to anyone Worst company in the world Wouldn't recommend them to anyone,1
"Uber driver was late and stopped 50 meters ahead of where he was supposed to be. We wave him down but he doesn't come. We call him, he doesn't talk but hangs up then a couple of seconds later starts moving towards us at 5km/h I question if he is ok when he arrives as he seems either drunk or sleepy or just completely spaced out. I don't want to risk the lives of myself and my partner and her  5 year old son. Driver gets aggressive and doesn't want to drive us anymore after we waited for him for so long. I tell him not to yell as he is scaring the 5 year old and its at this moment that he cancels the trip and orders us to get out of his car. The 5 year old boy is getting out of the car with one leg on the ground when the driver decides to accelerate. This fool is playing a game with his 1500kg car and a 20kg child. We yell at him and I put the car in park so that he cant harm anyone. We advised him we will be taking it up with the Police. Its at this moment, like an infant, this driver begins playing the victim and starts pacing around his car while its in the middle of the road with doors open and hazards on. A tantrum for the adult who realises what he has done is wrong and illegal. I have contacted uber and am awaiting their call. If I'm not happy I have an active social media presence and will escalate to the proper ombudsmen as well as the police. I REALLY hope uber do not defend this dangerous and irresponsible individual and resolve this quickly. Very very disappointed and angry,.... edit: Update - uber customer service (if you can call it that) is abysmal. They are siding with the driver and banning the passenegers account whilst not revealing ANYTHING about their 'investigation' hiding behind their privacy policy. strongly considering posting the pics and videos of the driver and his car online. Customer service rep was Abhi who didn't provide us with any resolution and in fact just made things much much worse. Please don't pretend to care about dangerous behaviour if you clearly don't...",1
"While in San Diego I got three charges in Chicago in one evening for Uber. Two of the charges were visa, one PayPal. Uber would not respond to my emails whatsoever. However both visa and PayPal refunded my money. Now how do you suppose my Uber account got hacked?",0
Uber is ripping everybidy off. The charge too much for a short distance it is almost safer and faster to get a cab simce they have a stupid map that does not show the driver where should he meet the person who requested tge ride. It happneded to me several times that the driver could not find my location. Everytime the fare came as a surprise to me. Too much!!!! I used to be able to contact the driver to tell them my address and now I can not even do that.,0
Trabajar como chofer de uber Es el tipo de exploration mas horrible que se a credo en la ultima decada ya que no cumplen con sus predicaciones donde recomendan que se unan a ellos como trabajadores,0
"Uber for me is so buggy that I can simply not use it. I can not get my head around how a billion dollar company can not build a working app or website. Bug (design flaw) 1: you need to request permission through support to use the mobile website as a rider. Bug 2: right now, the entire help.uber.com website is down. For hours. What?! Bug 3: once you've been granted ""permission"" to use the mobile web-interface for rides, there is no way to change your phone number. There's an ""edit"" button for the phone number on the non-mobile website, but this then tells you to go to the app (which you can't use, that's why you're using the mobile site, durrrr). Bug 4 (design flaw): once you've signed up with Uber there is no easy online way to delete your Uber account. I've looked into this and you actually need to contact support (the same support who's webpage is completely down right now) and write them an email saying you want your account deleted. Really?! In 2017? They're a billion dollar company but their website and software is worse than that written by a startup full of 12 year olds in their moms basement. I feel sorry for any talented coders working under Uber's obviously out of control ""manage""ment.",0
"I have a issue with one of my ride which I was wrongly charged. But Uber is not giving me such option where I can write about this or even ask about it. On 17th of jan., 2017 i booked a uber from besent nagar, Chennai to Hotel leela Palace, mrc nagar. First rate estate was showing approx INR 60 but receipt came of INR 130. Then i checked and found that driver started the meter from where he got that i request a cab and drop location was also wrong, he stopped the meter somewhere else after droped me at my location. My email id is tanwarvikas00@gmail.com",1
"I am Active Duty Army. I tried to apply to be a driver for Uber. They will not accept my valid drivers license. My license has an expectation date of 00/00/0000 because under Tennessee law it does not expire until I exit the service. Uber's automated email system kept telling me that it was expired. When I emailed the help line, I got an email back saying this: ""we understand that you had a question about requesting an exception to our requirement for a valid State driver's license. I'm afraid that we are currently unable to allow exceptions to this requirement. We know that Active Duty Service Members may relocate frequently. While many local regulations recognize this, these terms do not necessarily apply beyond personal driving."" There is nothing wrong with my license, I am not asking for an exemption. My license is valid. On top of that I had to jump through hoops to get my account reset because when I drunkenly set it up the first time I put in the wrong email. So I am beyond fed up with this company. I'm moving to Lyft!",0
I see there are four cabs near my home still 2x surge !!! Switching to Ola. If this continues uber will shut down soon.,0
The service and availability is good but they put exorbitant fare almost every day. Practically useless for daily commuters.,0
"This review is not just about the airport pick up, but in general for people who wish to know how to travel. The best and only taxi company that I would recommend is Blue Bird, they are great! They always use the meter and the drivers are professional The other taxi companies (dark blue, purple, grey colour taxis, not the light blue - blue bird taxis) are all rip offs! Be careful, they are scammers and rude 99% of the time. Ok now onto Uber, it can be great and it can be not so great, I would say 75% of the time it is good, but if you get one of these drivers look out - Booked a Uber ride at 6.09pm with driver ""I Dewa Made Satrya"" to pick up from Nikki Beach Club, after waiting at the front of the club for 10 mins it was clear he was not coming as his vehicle which was 1km away was not moving in our direction, but I was surprised when the app changed to being on the journey, a few minutes later it finished but I was charge 15,000 rah (of course you waste time and write to uber the they refund it, but why should loyal passengers need to go through such crap when it is clearly not their fault?) I then booked Uber again at 6.19pm, the same driver ""I Dewa Made Satrya"" accepted the booking but this time, he messages me on WhatsApp to tell me unless i pay cash he is not coming, so I try to change the payment method to cash but this is not allowed on the Uber app, so when I tell the driver this he says unless I pay him cash he will not come!! He then asked me to cancel, but luckily it is within the 5 min BS time limit so I am not charged a cancellation fee this time (even though again it is not my fault!) I advised the driver ""I Dewa Made Satrya"" that the service is terrible, he told me he does not care and when I said I would report this service to Uber he said ""I do not fear"", clearly Uber does not care for passenger service and is happy to hire anyone in Bali as a driver, as I would never employee someone with such an attitude, especially when now 18 hours later he just sent me another offence message to my phone ""You Emang Top"" Anyway avoid the driver ""I Dewa Made Satrya""with phone number +62 821 4407 1347 I then attempted to make another booking, this time it was picked up by driver ""Nyoman"", this booking was at now 6.29pm, this driver was 8 minutes away and started driving to my location, so I was thinking great finally have a driver, he was within about 3 minutes away and then I noticed he kept going passed the turn off and when I contacted him he said he is not coming, I could see on the app he was like 3 mins away, then 6 mins, 9 min, 12 min and clearly not coming to Nusa Dua but driving to Ulawatu, this driver just ignored all contact from me via message/phone, just keep driving and I guess waiting for me to cancel, which I finally did, clearly another driver that does not care for passenger service Please avoid ""Nyoman"" driver and his number is +62 812 3786 5029, he clearly does not care and should not be allowed to drive for Uber. Ok so finally made another booking with Uber, it is now 6.40pm, the guy turns up, very nice driver, but as I got into the car and sat down my daughter was just getting into the car and the driver starts to drive off, without her being in the car, the door was still open, my daughter then hit the road and was left on the street, this was clearly an accident but careless driving from Uber, I will not write his name, as he was nice, but clearly not careful. Anyway basically after about 4 bookings, waiting 40 minutes, writing to uber for refund for my 15,000 Rph, we made it home to the villa in seminyak. Honestly i love Uber, use it all over the world, however, I think in some cities like China (especially Beijing), Bali and Sydney the server now is terrible and the prices are on the increase so a taxi can be about the same!!!! Once uber gets the marketshare they want they increase the prices without warning!",0
Why is it if they take money out of your account for the Uber rides that they have to take additional money which they say it's an authorization hold but they do not put it back for at least eight days and this is money that I cannot access and another thing if you have an Uber gift card they still want to put monies from the ride from your checking account on hold when it is confirmed that they will get paid by the Uber gift card. I have for three weeks been trying to resolve this problem on two separate situations and the customer service is horrible. Isn't it illegal for them to keep a hold on your money even after they get paid for the services of an Uber driver taking you to your destination. And why does it take so long for it to drop off from your checking account they should confirm you have the money then debit your account for the Uber ride and then that's it. I am trying to find out how to issue an official complaint against Uber because of the situation can you please help,0
"My first experience with uber was absolutely horrible. A driver by the name of Wylder picked up myself and a friend and we were under the impression this was a safe, comfortable and convenient way to get to our location. It was not. The car (ford focus) was in horrible shape, the seats were tore up and covered in nasty stains. The vehicle smelled like cigarette smoke so bad I could hardly breath, and the driver was very unprofessional. He didn't use GPS and asked if we minded if he picked up a 3rd passenger on our way, we accepted since there was room, but then Wylder drove around for 30+ min looking for this other potential ""client"". He finally drove back to the location that he picked us up at and said ""I am suppose to be looking for a girl named Brittany""... umm, That would be me! He didn't seem to know what he was doing one bit. I felt very unsafe with his driving ability as he was all over the road and made sharp sudden turns in the wrong direction on several occasions. With this being my first experience with uber, I was very dissatisfied and probably wont be using the services again",1
"I drive for uber in Orlando. My car is always clean, safe and I received a lot of great feedback from passengers. I driven all over Orlando many times very late at night only for uber to keep all my earning and display that I owe them. I've had to spend for a lot of gas and tolls, new breaks, tires, deep cleaning because of messes made by some passengers and when I ask where are my earnings I get a bs response. It's as if I been doing favors for people driving them around all for nothing. I'm going to find out who I can talk to so I can file suit again uber",0
"On app Uber lures u to money making areas but once u get there,your riding around wasting gas hoping you get a rider. wear and tear on your vehicle....good luck with that.

"I requested an Uber ride on Thursday the 15th 2016 to take me from my home in Apopka Vineland to a Dentist Office in Dr. Phillips. The Uber arrived and took me to an address that I explained to him did not appear to be the correct address as it appeared to be that of a private home in a private neighborhood instead. I tried to explain this to the Uber driver, however, very rudely he requested assured me that that was the correct address. I got out of the vehicle to check the place out and see if it was the office, but, the Uber turned around and left me there (IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE!!!!) I contacted Uber on their contact line to tell them about their experience on repetitive occasions, however, to this day 23rd of the month no one ever did. This is quite unbelievable for me as I have been riding with Uber for a long time and dedicated; but if I ever have something like an outstanding balance with them they never play to hurry notify me for their funds. All I wanted was for someone to return my messages so I could state my case. Was that too much to ask for???",1
"Emailed them about an issue with Uber Pool (Driver name Tejan in Mitsubishi Lancer in DC metro area on Saturday night at 8:14pm) and was promised internal investigation but they didn't contact me after that, shared a trip with another 3 people instead of 2, all drunk, one of them with a drink in his hand. I am a girl and was not willing to make an issue and was hoping the driver will do something but he didn't open his mouth to stop the F Words coming from the mouth of the men instead he opened the window and let us freeze in the cold because of alcohol smell. Inappropriate touching due to us crammed in the back, their girlfriend was in between but the guy with a drink kept his arms around her reaching to my shoulder. Uber customer service is a joke.",1

I am an uber driver and all I can its sh*t for the money and you get sh*ty customers Rating is a load of bull**cks. Why would I want to rate my rider what difference is it gone make to me or them Why rate driver just why ... Who gives Damn ?

"After my credit card info was stolen and charged via Uber, fortunately the amount was refunded. But my nightmare didnt stop there. Soon I found my Uber account was inaccessible and they replied that I need to email them the scanned copies of my government ID and credit card. I told them that would expose me to bigger risk and willing to meet their local employee if necessary. They sent me this ""I've reviewed your account. It appears that your account has been suspended for activity that violates our Terms and Conditions and will be unavailable for you to use until further notice. We will let you know if we will consider lifting the suspension."" Do I smell some sabotage there? I violated T&C because I am trying to protect myself not sending my credit card?",0
Without a doubt the worst experience of my life with Internet based services. Drivers in NYC either can't follow directions or have difficulty conversing in English. I couldn't find a way to communicate my frustrations with Uber. The phone number posted goes to a fax machine or another digital line. I am a SF Bay Area resident and was shocked at my experience. Moving on to give Lyft a try.,1
"I have been driving for Uber for 3 weeks and haven't been paid a cent! They keep telling me 'we have resolved your problem' when they bloody well have not. The keep telling me my bank info is incorrect. I have checked it 12 bloody times. It is perfect. I have sent them screenshots of my bank into and screenshots of it entered into the Uber system. 100% match. Still, the can't pay me. They tell me to go to the local Uber office, which I do. They verify that my banking info is 100% correct. So, they suggest I go to my bank. I do that. The bank verifies that the info I have given Uber is 100% correct and everyone is scratching their heads because they can't understand why Uber can't pay me the hundreds of dollars they owe me. And, all I get from Uber is copied and pasted form responses. $#*! you, Uber.",0
"Recently, my Uber account was hacked. Suddenly I was driving all over Nigeria (I live in Minnesota). When I tried to address the hack, I discovered 1. Uber has no phone-based customer service, 2. Uber's email customer service is basically useless. After visiting the Uber office nearest to me, I was given a promise that the charges would be reversed and my account would be cancelled. After 3 days, the charges were reversed, but Uber refused to cancel my account. Now, more charges are being accrued and Uber customer service is again refusing to respond personally to my complaints. Guess I will be making another trip (this will be the 3rd) to the home office closest to me. Uber does not let you cancel your account- you must go through their customer service representatives. And when you do, they refuse to do it. I will advise every person I know to cancel their account and switch to a different ride service.",0
"I have used Uber pretty much since it was introduced. However, now that Uber tracks your location EVEN if your phone is OFF, i'm out. I will never use Uber again until they change this policy.

"My wife had a foot operation and we used Uber in Miami against my wish, but the drivers had no training ie waiting for the passenger to get downstairs from their flat. We were over charged and Uber promised but we never got the refunds. The best option is to get a licensed cab where ever you may live, if you go to London ever, Uber cars are more expensive than black cabs in the rush hours and they don't know, even with GARMIN where they are going. PS ; Uber is valued in Billions on the stock market, because they get 15% of the cost of the ride worldwide everyday.",1
I have asked Uber 5 times via email for directions on creating an Uber account. It will not let us do it because it wants a mobile phone number. We are retired and have no need for a mobile phone anymore. I need to use my house phone but it rejects it. How can I utilize Uber services without having to purchase a mobile phone. It does not make any sense. Can anyone help us?,0

Evey week I have to go to doctor appointment to the same address and I have isssue with the driver finding the correct address because his gps show a different point of pick up .the worse part the driver cancel and I get charge for it BS ..soon uber will lose all his customer because the service is just awful.,1
"We called an Uber to head to the San Jose airport as we often do. Our first driver showed up and asked us where we were going and we said San Jose airport. Immediately he said he is ""going to have to pass"" since he wants to get home soon. He didn't want to take us that far. I find this appalling - the airport is a 18 miles, 20 minute ride away. If he didn't want to accept passengers then why did he accept our ride? We wasted 8 minutes Waiting for him for nothing. We then called another Uber and she came after 5 minutes. She also asked us where we were going and when we told her the airport she said she had to pass because she didn't have proper authorization to make trips to the airport. Needless to say we were pretty pissed at this point but decided third time's a charm. The third driver was 5 minutes away. We called him right then and there and specifically asked him if the airport as a destination was going to be a problem. He said ""I think it's ok"". Then a couple minutes later we got a cancellation notice. That is THREE DRIVERS in a row that refused to give us a ride based on our destination. It's not like we were asking to go 100 miles away. SJC is the closest airport to the Fremont area and there was no traffic at this time of day. We ended up using Lyft and even with a 75% prime time charge, we knew we would get reliable service and a driver that was courteous and would take is to where we needed to go. And that is exactly what happened. Our Lyft got us there swiftly and with no issues or complaining about the destination. Uber, you have LOST this customer. I find this appalling and completely unprofessional. One cancellation I can maybe understand and brush off as a specific driver issue. 3 in a row means there is something systemic going on and that your customer service model is broken. Take care of your drivers so they take care of your customers. Completely unacceptable and unprofessional. Doesn't seem like there's enough reprimanding for drivers canceling on riders. Use Lyft or alternatives and stay away from Uber.",1
"I took an UBER from Pacific Heights to the SF airport and it cost $85.00!!!! That is outrageous! I was not told of the charge, as the driver picked me up at the airport, then stopped at my hotel to get my suitcase and then to the airport. The traffic was bad, but he should have told me it would be $85.00, that is crazy!!",0

I have recently been using uber in Panama central America it has turned into a nightmare experience not only with drivers but also with Uber Support personal. one driver charged me 10 dollars for a fare that has been costing me only 3dollars I made a complaint and instead of supporting me they blocked me from something the driver said about me. He was not the person on the profile also and obviously just a friend of the taxi Uber Driver. I found the app malfunctioned so many times that it caused distress to me. The drivers were so rude that they never answered calls or texts. One taxi driver went to wrong place and did not respond to me I waited for an hour for an arrival but he never turned up. The Uber Support personal are also rude and don't listen to your complaint properly I was actually blocked from using uber because of a driver telling lies about me. I have never been treated so awfully by a taxi service in my entire life.,1
I have been charged multiple times now for rides I have not taken. And every time I try to resolve the issue I'm never able to get a hold of anybody and nobody contacts me back. It is more of a scam then a service,0

I use UBER frequently but this last time I was accused by a White driver that her property was stolen from her car. UBER contacted me to tell me my account had been canceled. I tried to contact UBER but they never replied back.,0
"Uber ripped me off! Applied ""surge charge"" of 2.2x the fare but there was no prior notification of this in the app. I was not informed and did not grant permission for this. The app only showed a fare estimate of Â£7-9. I got home to find that a taxi journey that ALWAYS costs me around Â£7-9 had cost Â£22.50, already charged to my card and I had no means of recourse in the app. I had to go onto their website to file a ""report a serious issue with you driver"" case to get to a human and they didn't read anything of what I had written - just robotic copy and paste answers! I threatened to take it further and finally got the surge charge refunded but they said it would be a one-time gesture only, so this could happen again and I'd simply be screwed. They made out that they were doing me a massive favour and I was just lying about not being notified of the surge fare. The next day (today), bizarrely I got an email through: ""Hi xxxx, To ensure your security, we have reset your password. To log into Uber, you will need to choose a new password."" Then when I try to reset this I get the following: ""SOMETHING WENT WRONG. There has been an error, and we are currently looking into it."" However others can log into their accounts using this same computer/same IP. I then checked the app and it was not accessible to me either, so they have killed my account it seems because I demanded my money back. It's fine by me because there wasn't going to be a next time anyway, but what a crooked, horrible company! Avoid!",0
We caught our Uber driver stealing our phone in Las Vegas. Uber did nothing to resolve the situation. And then they sent us an email stating they investigated and the case was closed. Please take Lyft or a taxi.,1

"Really Disgusting! This is the condition of National Capital Region, the biggest frustration people facing here is conveyance and moreover traffic. Nobody is hell bothered about 9-10 hours of jobs extending to 12, 13, 14, 15 hours and so on. A person going to office or market thinks to book Uber/ Ola, the first question the driver asks is DROP KAHA KA HAI- i.e. Where is your drop location. Whereas, its clearly mentioned in Ubers rule book that the driver is not suppose to ask the drop location, not a big deal the rules are as fake as the company is. After waiting for 10-15 minutes, either the driver switches his mobile off, or standing at one position he will say that I am not able to track your location or even he will just sit over it and cancel the trip after 15 min with no intimation. This is not something that happens once or twice a week, this is something that happens twice/ thrice a day. Then for all the cancelled trips they will deduct 80/- (per trip), now if a person doesnt have the time to write them the incidence happened, they will not even return the money back. Even after my last complain to uber, I attached the screenshots and sent them, these people apologized and gave me vouchers to close the matter and said that this will not happen again. But what next, everytime I should write them such detailed mail so that they pay attention to this, they dont even have a customer care. Moreover the driver has the guts to say that JAO KAR DO COMPLAIN or Okay, Jisse kehna hai kaho. Because what worst, just that they will not get the days incentives, nothing more then that. Everybody is just into money printing business, and who is the sufferer, just the common man. Frustrated person, at last when goes to an auto wala so either he will be on strike or he asks for money as per his choice, because there are no rules. Nobody is there to check. Why is the common man working so much, just to get frustrated and depressed, for he is helpless for so many things and at last he should be happy that he has money to get admitted in a branded hospital. Anybody in India can strike for any non sense thing demanded, what should a common man do. Leave all his work and strike for the thousand things that he has to face because of wrong people into business. What is the government doing. Meru and mango are out of business because of uber and ola. If this will be the case, the day is not far off that even uber and ola will be out of business.",1

"There is an uber driver here in St. Pete that is a drug user and dealer; he offered me marijuana and or pills. He was high, his eyes were glassy and glazed-over he and his car had the stench of marijuana. He also offered rides off the app and is a go between for an escort. Mark gukpm",1
An uber was called to bring my friends home. He heard them argue the entire way home it's a friend that she was trying leave. He then proceeded to pick the same girl up and take her to the airport. As several of us told him not to take her because she was drunk.,1
Uber is literally looting it's customers in the name of SURGED FARES in PUNE. After 6:30 evening whenever you try to book an Uber Cab...fares are surged. Starting from 1.2 X(available for minutes only) it goes to 2.6X till 8 pm and that too in norm days..leave aside in rains even if there are cabs available in that area. I don't understand it's parameters of surging. In a minute you see 1.2X surged fare and the next minute that fare expiresand you have to pay 2.4X. People you can try it yourself. Simply Cheating!!!!!!!,0
"my husband was at a concert at the NRG stadium in Houston on 8/5/16 at concert end during the ""surg"" time couldn't get his app to work. He called me when I was sleeping, sick, and groggy and saw the 8.2 percent surge charge but thought like a tip 15 percent of the total like a tip amount. I was so upset when I saw 341.00 for the total this am!!!!!This is wrong and law suit worthy. They need to make it very clear for the tired and apparently not bright to make a person realize that they will be stolen from a ludicrous amount. I am going to file a complaint with the better business bureau and refuse to ever use them again. And they don't make it easy at all to complain on there site. Please don't use them try lift or others even a taxi would have been less expensive!",0
"requested for uber at 09:30am to reach office, it showed waiting of 8 minutes. Waited for ueber till 10:00am and then saw d tracker,the driver was nowhere near to my place. Called him and explained the directions ,,no response till 10:10am.. finally booked ola cab and reached my office. Will never book uber again..this was d second time..",1
"I was ripped off for $150 for cleaning fee. After a night out, I call uber and got a ride home. I got in the front seat and got home within 12 minutes. The ride is about $7. I got a receipt for about $7. I have no idea the driver file a charge of $150 for cleaning until I look in my credit card bill. I never received the receipt for the $150 until I complain to uber. Apparently, my driver file a cleaning fee to my ride with pictures of the middle back seat being wet and a little mess. I was sitting in the front seat. And if I don't get an alert that the charge was going to tag on, where is the avenue where I can contest this charge. The mess could have been made by the previous rider or the driver lied and file s false report. But if I don;'t get the alert right away, there is no way for me to contest this. That's why this is a scam. I will suggest all rider to take pictures of the interior of the car before leaving the car. Just to be safe so that you don't get rape by Uber.",1
"Never seen before, the driver don't come for pick up and charged me 5 pound cancellation fee , I called for an other driver , the estate charge was 17 pound maximum, the driver confirm that it will be around 14 pound , they charged me 21 pound . I been charged for the same distance 16 pound to 17 pound with golden line . I tried to call them their's no number for those people. This company is really rubbish . I will never use it again. AVOID IT .",1
"First Uber, need to have a ASAP phone number !!People beware of your account your phone tablet DON""T let anyone use it!!! Keep away from young people because they will use it, For instance an 13 yr old family member use another family member phone we know how some kids are be real, Well, this one stole the phone and went riding around visiting his friends which had moved. Yes, the mama please do not ask, Then the family member couldn't find his phone call for ride no ride. Now different drivers driving him around so I say, to drivers DUMMY",0
"Please think twice before you become a partner with uber,and don't be a fool of believing them that you can earn 60,000rs per month. Here is the business model for fooling partners. you earn 2000 per day, i.e 60000 per month uber commission is 20% i.e 12,000 rs service tax is 5% i.e 3000rs now you are left with 45000 rs you need to spend at least 600 rs for diesel every day,as you need to move your vehicle continuously in search of trips Now you are left with 27,000 rs You need to pay your emi, say 12,000. You are left with 15000 rs so you can earn 15,000 rs if you drive 14 hours a day. if you are planning to get a driver then you might have to pay your e.m.i from your pocket. and after all this please remember you are not gurranted to earn 2000rs daily. and due to a tuugh competition given by ola now it has become very difficult to earn even 1200 - 1500 per day. So stay alert from this trap",0
"I requested an uber from my home 10 minutes from DTW on Saturday July 16 at 6:45am. 11 minute eta. 8 minutes into it, I had my son check on it THE TRIP was cancelled. OMG what a predicament I had. Ended up driving myself. Cannot trust to do this again.",0
Today I feel I was taken advantage of by UBER. I am a loyal uber customer who has used UBER many times for work and personal use. I have never run into what happened to me this morning with a ride charge of $68.97 US in New York. When I requested a ride I was told the fair was approx $18 from my hotel to LGA Airport. A surcharge screen then came up which advised me a 2.3 surcharge would apply to this rate. I didn't understand it and read it as an additional 2.3%. Now I am advised that it means actually an additional 2.3 rate. Even at that 2.3 rate $18x2.3=$41 not $68.97. When I received the uber receipt after the fact I was charged $68.97. I would have never agreed to this. A normal cab ride was $40. I feel violated and cheated by Uber. This system is not set up right and is very confusing for the customer. I won't be using UBER again as the company after numerous attempts will not help.,0
"Holy sh!t!!! So, I have nobody in my life, on purpose. I'm chronically sick, and take care of myself. Today I am convinced by EMS, against my better judgment to be taken to the ER, by them. Usually I drive myself. I think, oh yeah, Uber gives a first ride free, I'll get home that way. WRONG! Code not working. One response from twitter and email support. I'm desperate, I feel like total crap. I'm basically trapped at the hospital after a horrible day. I get completely desperate, phone about to die, I'm literally begging support to help. No response. I can't walk home, I have handicap plates if that says anything about walking two miles to the bus stop with my oh so generous bus pass from the hospital. Before the phone finally dies, I have to call the only person I even have a number for anymore, a previous abuser. THAT'S HOW I GOT HOME UBER, YOU F##KS! Wishing you a virulent outbreak of permanent herpes. All of you pieces of sh!t. Hope this happens to a loved one of yours too you sick MFs. Go to hell. Sick as f##k!",0
Map is not working! I had to call both the passenger and driver to track them! When you have children riding in Uber you better have a working map!,0
I requested a ride at 7:45pm I could see the driver on the map never leave his home. The driver calls me and tells me he is outside my home when I knew he wasn't I called back and the driver was very rude he was very rude I hate to say it but mostly all every African drivers I get from uber are rude and they always have an attitude. The driver told me he was not coming to pick me and hung on me I was then charged a cancellation fee when the driver was the one that cancelled the trip. I never have this issue with lyft uber needs to get better drivers I will not be taking another uber i will use lyft or walk to my destination. I find it ridiculous I have to deal with someone rude when they are getting paid to drive me around.,1
"I feel like i got scammed driving for uber. One example i made $141 over a period of 9 hours got $100 sounds good right WRONG! I put $30 in gas + 300 miles on my car. Now mind you im in a busy area by the airport. They take 28% of every ride + they charge the rider $2.30 booking fee. So i do 97% of the job take 100% of the risk and what do i get after maintaining the car tires, oil change, other expenses, car value going down? well you tell me i could be working at a gas station making more then $70 with my car value + my gas still in my car. Ohh and uber gets 100% of the profit taking ZERO RISK how is this called a service and not a scamm? Look all im saying is i feel like i got scammed. If you feel like you got scammed then you got scammed PERIOD! Its like i paid uber and i gave a bunch of people free rides. *$#% you uber.",0
$129.00 to travel across town in Boise. About 10 miles. 1st time used. Saturday on a non Holiday weekend. Mobile app is crap on advising you of your total cost until you get home and your email presents the shocking damage. Took over 13 minutes to get picked up too. SCAM!!,0
"Requested a ride on my Uber app on July 3 from Eden Prairie, MN to Minneapolis, MN. The first driver went to the wrong location and didn't bother trying to contact me to see why I wasn't there; for this I was charged a $5 cancellation fee. My daughter looked at the app and noticed it said that my request hadn't gone through. She sent a new request and for some reason I was charged another cancellation fee, this one was for $6. The driver who did finally show up 30 minutes after my initial request charged me $60 for a 19 mile trip. For the return trip I tried Lyft and not only did the driver show up within 5 minutes of my request, he also only charged me $18.60! Guess which service I'll be using from now on and recommending to my family and friends? Hint: it's not Uber.",1
I did an estimate on a trip that was supposed to only be an estimate price for $20. I didn't realize I picked a sub so after the ride I was charged $68.00. Why would I want to pay $68 if the taxi would of onlyour costed $30 I used Uber for over an year Iat not use uber anymore that was an outrageous price to pay for an $30 trip .,0
I got an estimate fare which said my journey would've between Â£23-Â£31 but got charged Â£53. I complained and got nowhere,0
"Never could get a confirmation. My G.P.S. was floating. They said my phone was not valid. In Chicago, it's not worth the delay. NEVER again, this has been disgusting.",0
"I would like to unsubscribe from Uber's emails but after contacting their support, speaking to several people and several messages back and forth I am still getting their promotional emails. They claim that they have done all they can to unsubscribe me but the emails persist.",0
The surge pricing is a huge scam! I was charged $93 for a $45 ride in a car that was falling apart! I could have had a limo for $85.,0
"Always have good experience with Uber but I think their quality is declining. I booked an Uber today. 1990 toyota camry, AC was not ON and didnt work. the seat had some kind of plastic cover which made the experience ever worst. wanted to keep bag in the trunk but the trunk was junk. The driver was irritating kept asking how long have you been in Chicago. He had phone in one hand and was driving with the other and kept missing the direction even though it was clear on his cell phone on he route we were taking. I will think twice before requesting an Uber because a Cab provides me with better experience then Uber",1
"They will fail eventually. Few years from now, Uber will be a case study in business classes for bad execution.",0
"I am an UBER Driver. UBER is a fundamentally dishonest company. First of all, in over two years of driving, I've never met or spoken to anyone who works for the company. It's all done via email. Second, anytime you write them for any reason, you receive a canned response that shows your original email was neither read nor comprehended by a human. Then they won't adjust fares when you've been shorted until you've sent at least five or six emails. Finally, they'll relent, usually. You'll get multiple responses that are canned and look like dialogue from Valley Of The Dolls. The people who get in your car are sometimes smelly and your car will smell the next day. Also, UBER is a terrible corporate citizen. .85 cents a mile/.75 cents for UBER Pool plus .13 per minute means that when you deduct .575 cents a mile while riders are in the car and .575 cents per mile to get to the rider, you'll LOSE MONEY ON EACH AND EVER RIDE! This means a full time UBER Driver will never pay a dime in taxes, qualify for Social Security or have any money in life. All full time UBER drivers will end up a burden to the government while their cars have been polluting the environment. The Wussy County Commissions all across the country that have rolled over for this company are anything but public servants. They are fools. If you want a cheap ride, do not care about taking advantage of other humans and like rewarding a greedy morally bankrupt corporation, by all means, continue too use UBER. Also, UBER Pool -- You get into a car with people you don't know and a driver you don't know. You go on a route you don't need to go on. As a driver, you're a rolling day care center for drunks. UBER Company calls us drivers partners. That's CRAP. They treat us as if we're illiterate, mentally challenged minors. They lie, threaten, and constantly sell lie after lie after lie. My prediction is UBER will continue to have success for a long time ahead but will come to be vilified as the horrific example of greed that they are. Their treatment of people and disregard for our environment, our laws, and most of all the safety and well being of their drivers is as egregious as any company in the history of America. The Pussy Politicians that are rolling over for this company are also an embarrassment to our country.",0
"I've had countless issues with uber drivers claiming false cancellations, claiming to have picked me up when they hadn't, etc. Tonight a guy picked me up and immediately started hinting that I lived too far away. Mid way through the ride he finally concluded that I did,in fact, live too far away (he just wasn't familiar with the New York area at ALL- NO, Brooklyn isn't in Manhattan). He kicked me out of the car in the middle of the night in a bad neighborhood and cancelled the ride. I had to walk with my three heavy bags all the way home because of other issues with false cancellations and uber. Lyft isn't much better but fewer terrible experiences for sure.",1
"Too much words are needed to explain about this big scam ,whether you are a driver or a rider. I have experienced both sides. Uner is collecting your information and selling them and ripping off the driver and the rider both! Stay away from this evil at any cost !",0
"First, I requested an Uber driver that was 6 minutes away from me in an appropriate amount of time before I needed to get to my destination. I needed to be at the airport by 8:30 a.m. and contacted Uber at 7:40. I didn't want to have to pay for parking at the airport. When I requested the Uber driver I saw that he has 4 out of 5 stars and figured he would be a good driver.  However, the driver seemed to be lost and had no clue where he was. He passed my street four times, which my street is not that difficult to find! He kept making U-turns and turning down the wrong streets.  For a driver, you're suppose to know where you're going! And if you don't know, follow the GPS! It was an awful experience that I had with Uber. I had to pay an outrageous price for parking at the airport and was late for my flight! If the driver just knew where he was going or knew how to use a GPS then this issue wouldn't be an issue!  Since I canceled the Uber ride they want to charge me for a cancelation fee! Uber really needs to test their drivers to see if they're smart enough to use a GPS. Although, you'd think it would be common knowledge... I guess not.",1
It is a ripoff for both drivers and riders. Uber gets the money and your car and pocket suffers. Not to mention the safety issues. I drove for Uber for two days; 4 rides. Up to 19 per hour?? Not even close! More like 2.00 per hour not mention you only get paid for the ride to the riders to their destination. The rest is on you! http://digg.com/video/uber-scam-rip-off-for-drivers,0
"I used this once in America, I was advised to get the app which I did. 10 months later they have taken nearky Â£300 out my bank account.!!!. I'm. In touch with the fraud team now it's stress I can do without...",0
I have used Uber a few times and I found it very expensive. I have order taxi and it showed me it was arriving in a few minutes but then it stated that it has been cancelled. I have ordered one again today and it has gone to wrong address. I was advised to change address on the system but Uber would keep on showing the wrong address. I have set the address many weeks ago and and travelled to/from same work address but today it is a different story because it is same street but different area. I have been charged Â£3-50 for Users poor system. I will not use Uber again just waste of time and money.,0
"Uber drivers are not held to the same standards as cab drivers. They often cancel your ride and the company will put the charge onto your credit card. I have been trying to get 2 of those charges off of my card now for months with no resolution, having sent at least 8 emails to numerous individuals. It seems like you can never connect with the same person to solve your problem and there is absolutely no way to make contact by phone. I also tried to get an Uber out of the country and the guy just never showed. Another driver had no idea how to get to the airport that was 15 minutes away and took a route that took over an hour and I was almost late for my flight. Be wary travelers!",1
"I live in melbourne australia. i had a early morning hospital appointment today. only my seccond time using the service and i will never use again. it cost me double it would have had i waited for a cab. incidently the app told me i would be altered to a drop in surge if any in 30 mins!! in that time i could have and should have called a normal taxi.clear scam there considering this service is supposed to be on demand and i did not have the time to wait aroung for 30 mins for ubers claculations. but i wwas not prepared for it to be so outragously overpriced. i believe the app scams by telling you to wait till the surge drops or pay a series of charges. I'm on my way to the hospital waiting in the cold i dont have time to break down the charge list nor did i expect that in such a short distance i would be charged double. what should have been a 25 dollar fare to over 50!!! we caught a cab on the way back it was quick , hassale free and fare appropiate. UBER you just lost a customer and i will be letting others know about my experience.",0
"We took an uber home thinking it would be better than driving. It was a 25.09 ride which is absolutely fine, but a surcharge of over 50 dollars is absolute ridiculous. Our trip was 12 miles and we paid over 77 dollars. I have tried to call, email, anything to talk to a person and nothing has happened. Uber is absolutely ridiculous with the way they charge people. So disappointed in the company.",0
two days after using uber for transportation I checked my bank account and noticed seven un authorized fraudulent activities on my account. Be careful with giving out you financial information when setting up your account.,0
"App login issue, registration issue. Customer service has no phone number. To solve simple problems, you will see several non sense emails. No one will solve your problem. Bottom line , bad company, they do only show as a good customer service but have no solution for customer. DONT USE UBER, ITS A TROUBLE.",0
Uber is totally taking advantage and overcharging! They charged me over $100 for 10mile ride! Ridiculous!,0
I was at the airport and figured I would try Uber ..first guy ..we went around in circles Trying to navigate the map.. I don't Know where I am at the airport they say you can contact the driver or text I couldn't Second driver same thing ..you would think one of them would call me they could see I was still standing lost ..never ever again at least real cab drivers call you and let you know where to go and where they can meet you.. I hope they do not charge Me doe those two cancelations that would be the icing on the cake.. Uber you suck Bigtime,1
"A few week ago my boyfriend had ordered me an uber ride home. It was very late, and when I had gotten in the cab, the driver seemed really aloof and tired. I was very courteous, asked him how his night was, and the response I got was very groggy and rude. Regardless he started driving and when he hit over 50mph in a 25mph school zone, I started getting a bit uncomfortable and concerned. I asked politely if he could slow down and again, he answered with a rude tone of voice. A few days go by and I get a call from my boyfriend asking why he was charged $165.00 !!!!! The driver had accused me of vomiting in his car!!! And took ""fake photos"" and sent them to uber! It was appalling! And the photos he took looked like a crime seen it was so disgusting. It looked liked mushy popcorn and water, and the guy even went so far to smear it all over his car. Was just so gross. Never in my life have I thrown up in someone's taxi cab, and if I had felt sick, I would have politely told the man to pull over. I was not sick, I was not drunk, and I remember the ride clearly. Nothing along those lines had happened and I am shocked uber let him get away with something so terrible. Not only did he accuse an innocent passanger, but tried to steal money from my boyfriends account. TERRIBLE!!!!!",1
"I have been driving for uber for over nine months it was bad enough when they lowered the rates for our work, I got past that and kept on driving... Well last week in my review, they. Gave me a low score saying a rider said my vehicle didn't meet their standard of cleanliness, this was not true because I am constantly cleaning my vehicle and passengers are always ccomplementing me on. How fresh my vehicles smells, after passengers are in and out of your vehicle you will realistically have some sand in the floor, there is no way to logically and safely vacuum your car out between the hours of 10pm and 4am that's makes no sense which is what they tried to suggest to clean the car after each fare. How?? If u get trips back to back when do you clean of course if someone vomits you're going to clean that mess up... But to top it off when they said the car wasn't clean they took the opportunity to throw in There saying remember your PERSONAL HYGIENE as well, which was not even the comment.. I was personally offended and have not driven sense.. I am a clean person and just because my car was not emuculate enough for one rider shouldn't have turned into the opportunity to insult me... I know it was an automated response, but those two responses need to be separated from each other because they are two separate issues...",0
"this unprofessional driver wangjiku, I requested uber around 9:25.. if she don't have idea on pick up location she should not accept the request first of all.. but she accepted my request.. I wait for her nearly half an hour.. I'm giving her directions in the phone very clearly.. but she can not able to found me.. she even don't know the famous place DMV office of Santa Clara, I stressed her in the phone our famous apartment leasing office is exactly opposite to the DMV office.. but still waste driver did not catche me.. finally she is telling that she is going to cancel the trip in phone, but not even cancelled my trip.. because if I cancel the trip I'll get 2$ charge.. so I'm waiting for her to cancel the trip. I wait for 15 mins she did not cancel the trip. until she cancel the trip I can not able to request for another driver.. because she accepted that she can not able to pickup me, then the right thing is she must cancel the trip.. but not even its happened in this case.. so she has done these many mistakes1) she don't have idea of area where she is going to pick up 2) though I'm giving her clear directions she did not found me 3) she accepted that she can not able to pick up me after my almost half an hour request.. but still she did not cancel the trip.. 4) because of her unprofessional behavior she charged me cancellation fee.. she wasted my precious time.. my request to the management is don't give permission to the such kind of unprofessional and unexperinced drivers to drive the uber.. because customers finally get bad openion and worest experiences with the UBER",1

"So I used UBER last night... NEVER USE IT! I got dropped off by the first guy, before I could even put my seatbelt on (all of a sudden had to take his wife to work) So I call another Uber (gives me a 2.5 times rate.... with no information on what the heck the rate is, NO OTHER OPTION - that or no UBER, and every time you search another one.. the rate gets higher and higher....) I get home, there's no service.. I tip the guy decently in cash for getting me home finally Get inside, my wifi loads up UBER receipt $79!!!!!!! for a 15 minute ride........... NEVER AGAIN",1
I'm in New York and trying to catch a cab to the airport. It is pouring down rain and the taxis are busy. I decided that I would try UBER. The app kept timing out on my iPhone then it came up and said UBER Pool. I'm thinking OK I will share a ride and save some money. LaGuardia is only 7.5 miles away and it usually about $35 for a cab fare. It took about 15 minutes but I was willing to wait to I didn't miss my flight I had a very nice driver and a nice car but he couldn't tell me how much. I was the only passenger so I thought OK I got lucky and no one else is going to the airport since it said UBER Pool. I had no other choices anyway. I have a computer training business so I am very savvy with technology. I arrived at the airport and he said it would compute the fee but he couldn't tell me how much because the app had also put in JFK and not LaGuardia which is not what I chose. Maybe another potential customer not sure. I got the receipt and was charge $179 for the short trip. When I contacted UBER they said since it was busy they could charge me 3.6 times the normal fair. That is really taking advantage of your customers. I don't think my customers would be happy if I told them since they scheduled their training on a very busy day that my rate would be 3 or 4 times more than normal. This is price gouging. I will NEVER EVER use UBER again.,0
I have travelled with ola cabs was never cheated like this the driver made us pay the airport fee by cash 110 when it was alredy included in the.the bill was 286+110=396.when we paid 506=396+110,0
I hate this album ap more than any other. It so often ends up in the wrong pick up address then the call driver function fails. I hate it!,0
"Uber is charging very high and looting the money, I feel both Uber and OLA are like sister companies, Have collaborated behind screen to loot the money of ppl. One question is, is morning 6: 30 AM Peak time for you both? Shame.",0
DC: requested UberX and was Automatically slotted to UberPool without a chance to decline. 30 minutes late for a business meeting. Switched to Lyft,0
"Uber can be hit or miss. On my first Uber ride:	Going out with friends from a hotel we were staying at in Savannah, Ga. They ordered a ride and it was a great experience, no problems and a courteous knowledgably driver. On the second night out: After receiving a ride downtown on the hotel shuttle, we had dinner and went out exploring the nightlife. Then we order Uber and the app said they were 10 minutes away, no problem. As we followed the drivers progress at about 5 minute out, he called to confirm our location and said hed be there shortly. A few minutes later his location was off and we did not see him on the app. We called back his number and he said he is going to take another fare and we need to find a different ride. What an SOB you are Biell! By this time we were tired and frustrated. We saw a taxi and took that back to the hotel. The moral of the story: you cant trust Uber and you need a backup plan.",1
"I have a worst experience in UBER. Most Cheated company, worst drivers, rash driving. Never ever think to book this cab. I am not getting the option of negative rating.",1
"I was ripped off many times, overcharged by uber and when want to ask or complain, they of course have a bridge to nowhere type of system where it is impossible to actually state your complain, it is categorized where you can not find the right button. It also seems there is no real response",0
Opened the app with my iphone and was told I needed to go to my email. That never happened before. I don't have access to my primary email with my cell because I DON'T NEED TO. they have everything they need from me already amex platinum/email/picture/ all that stupid $#*! ALREADY. I get home and contact them and they have no answer for anything. Told me I should go to the community and talk about it. I'm 56 years old/own my own business/made over $400K last year. I don't go to blogs to talk about $#*! get real lol.,0

Driver never showed up and I was charge twice.,1
"It's been 2 years that we are using uber, but the kind of issues we have faced in past 2 months have totally washed away the past 2 years of good experience. I'll explain the major episodes- 1. Maruti Ritz- Me and my husband were travelling from sector 57 gurgaon and sec 14 gurgaon, my husband had to get down at huda city which was midway. There are 3 ways for this route, when we asked him to take the huda route he said i can't do this otherwise I'll be in loss, I'll move according to the navigation. We told him that this concept is for car pool, but he continuously kept on saying that you don't know, i am the employee i know. He continuously kept on howling ""mai apki wajah se apna nuksan thode na karaunga"". After damn frustration we asked him to call the customer care and ask, even after knowing the fact, what he again misbehaved and said that ""hum aisa isliye karte hain taki ap baad me ye na kaho k galat raste pe le gye navigation k hisab se"". He was not silent for a min till 3/4th the way. This is highly unacceptable. 2. We both had to travel from gurgaon to delhi, it was sunday eve not too much traffic also. We booked uber thrice. The first driver 6:08 pm when we called him after 5 min he said that he cant go to delhi.. in car pool its not possible. Second driver 6:14 pm, we called him within 2 min, he also asked where u hv to go, i disconnected the phn. He again called to ask the destination, i didn't tell. He said ok, he was jst 5 min away, we kept on waiting for 10 min, no response,.when we called to check, he switched off his phn. Then also we waited and kept on calling for 15 min then finally he cancelled the trip. Third driver 6:39 pm- he too was just 5 min away , for half an hour he kept on saying that i m searching whereas he was not. At last we asked him to reach rail vihar the nearest landmark, its clearly seen in the map, finally he replied "" madam mujhe search karna nahi ata"". Then i shouted and said that i am going to make a complain, he was at rail vihar within a min, bt we had already cancelled the trip. We were late by 1 and a half hour, moreover we were damn frustrated. Finally then i booked uber from my phn and we got the cab. 3. Today in the morning, i made a request for own car from sec 57 to 14 gurgaon. A driver mahinder, hundai accent accepted the request and said that its in pool and he is going to dwarka delhi. The rider he was having was also saying that i didn't opted for pool. He asked me to cancel, so i did. I was booking it for office, in hurry. I again sent a request and again he only accepted and when i called him, he replied i have to take this request otherwise ""meri ye trip waste ho jayegi"" i don't know how. I said i havent opted for car pool, I'll be late for office how does it matters to me k apki trip waste ho jayegi. So what he replied was, he actually shouted that ""to mujhe kya farq padta hai k apko late ho raha hai"". I have actually referred uber to many of my knowns, i now feel like writing these reviews everywhere. This is just not acceptable. These are only the major issues that i hv mentioned, and it actually doesn't matter if u cut their day's incentive when we are facing so many issues with so many drivers. They take advantage of your 6 trip incentive method and it will deteriorate uber's image, u should make it km based incentive method Uber is working only becoz of customers. Dont lose them.",1
I reported someone who stole my debit card and stole over $200.00 from my account. They did absolutely nothing. Someone told me via email someone has to pay for them to get around. I couldn't even speak to anyone.,0
"We arrived at San Fransisco Airport and walked towards the taxi rank.We were approached by a taxi driver offering to take us to our hotel he did say he was a Uber driver ( I do not have an Uber account). I knew that the fare should be around $45. During the journey our driver was constantly on his mobile phone either texting or speaking to other drivers. Arriving at our hotel he charged us $95. I my opinion don't use them, i certainly will never use them again.",1
very poor services. the person doesnot know the exact address. controlled by false messages. false rate.,1
Why is Uber such a fraud at pricing and worst at customer service?Please answer it.Being Billion Dollar industry and using treachery and fraud to charge customers?What happened to convenient ride at economic cost??For 2.5 km you might pay 100-120 Rupees(Indian)?Why because its peak time.IS it??I don't see any traffic on the road.Lol!! Their tantrums are worst than 11-year-old...I don't know what training their drivers receive.All they want is incentive and no attention to customer convenience,0
The customer service will drive you to insanity. Ive been attempting to get assistance now for 12 HOURS since their uberpool option isnt showing up on my viewer and the help system is automated.,0
"I traveled with the Uber Swift car (MH-14 FC 1375) at Hinjewadi,Pune Maharatstra. I am travelling at night time the driver is not driving car properly and always looking at the mirror. I change my place the he again adjust the mirror toward me. I have left the car in between. The driver was drank.... and talking in rude language. The Uber is not keeping good drivers.",1
"Recently, the Uber rates were lowered to a rate that significantly beats the rate to the standard yellow taxis in the city (NYC). Yet Uber finds a way to always scam the customer with ridiculous markups for ""busy"" times, or ""in demand"" areas, etc. Mind you, we're not talking about a measly 50 cent or so surcharge, they actually double the estimate rate on many occasions. One day without paying attention you might end up having to pay $80 for what you've taken at a rate $40 on several occasions only because there were quite a few people requesting other drivers in that area at once. Seriously?? The support is a complete joke. At least when I call a CC or my bank support, although I'm getting someone from Thailand or Singapore, someone actually picks up the phone. Uber doesn't even have a number! This is a company valued in the billions. Again...Seriously?? After you send the email for a charge dispute, they are very polite in telling you ""NO, our calculations are correct at present rider rates."" -Um NO, they're not if the more expensive rate setting alternative is cheaper. Folks, don't fall for the ""trend"" of using Uber because many others are. Trend setters will wait on line for 3hrs to get a muffin because so and so celebrity gets their pastries there. Yea I know...really stupid. So don't be one of those. Plenty of alternative car services in this big city that'll actually pick you up with a SET rate to give you before they even come. Otherwise, the yellow cabbies are still cheaper. No matter what BS marketing they try to pass you.",0
"I have had some terrible experiences with the uber cab drivers. They are terrible with directions and they are extremely arrogant. Once a driver asked me to get off the cab because he thought I gave the wrong pick up address. And in another instance, the driver shouted at me because I told him to take a specific route. I have had many such experiences and so have my family members.. If anyone faces an issue like this, please take them directly to the police station. I regret not doing that myself..",1
"We noticed UBER charges on our credit card for rides we did not take. Found out that we could not call UBER to notify them, only email. After 5 days of back and forth emails with 10 different 'customer service' people, during which time fraud charges were continuing with UBER (and we had cancelled the AMEX, which is strange)... UBER finally told us that a MISS MOM was using our account, or created their own account with our card. The ONLY fraud charges with the card were with UBER. They gave us zero peace of mind with their security systems with credit card information, basically we got the sense that there is NO security and they have NO sense of urgency when it comes to fraudulent credit card use. Luckily we have fraud protection with AMEX even though UBER will still try to hold us liable...Obviously Going to Lyft now.....UBER IS HORRIBLE",0
I was charged a 4.7 times surcharge Now i'm trying to resolve this with Uber customer service and what a joke It's like being trapped in an endless circle. I will not use them again and I will not recommend Uber to anyone,0
"Uber, a company valued at 61 billion dollars. Uber is very popular with their riders. The reason uber is so loved by their riders is because a uber ride is about 1/3rd the price of a taxi. A uber rider can pay a minimum of $4.80 for a ride. A taxi would charge around $10.00 for the same ride.. A uber driver will average 10 minutes to go pick up a rider and take the rider to their destination and drop them off. Uber driver ends the trip and uber instantly displays how much the driver is paid, $2.40 for the trip. The trip will take around 30 minutes of your time. Now the driver has to pay for their gas, insurance, wear and tear on their vehicle. After the driver figures in the expenses, he or she is left with a profit of zero!! I have drove for uber part time for 2 years plus. In the beginning I easily made $350.00 a week. Now I average $75.00 a week and drive twice the miles to make that. Uber has not sent my 2015 1099's to report the income to the IRS. When you email uber about a problem, you will receive a robot answer. Uber does not care about their drivers. Uber only cares about increasing their $61 billion dollar value to $81 billion. I am a retired man and my advice to anyone who is considering driving for uber is......DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!! You will be better off flipping burgers at McDonalds.",0
"UberPOOL is a total scam and as a matter of fact, I think the algorithm is totally off in many cases. UberPOOL would charge me more than a UberX for exactly the same route during the same time of a week and the only difference is POOL wasted me twice the time for picking up the second passenger from THE AIRPORT, where we had to drive in and wait and pick up the other passenger from one of the terminals. I tried contacting customer service FIVE TIMES because it made no sense to me at all and I doubt whether any of the customer support people had any sense how the product actually works or even how to read at all, because none of them ever answered my question and instead just said very random and useless things to me. Dear Uber, please at least spend some money training your people because they made your company look very stupid and unprofessional. And to NYC passengers, take the yellow cab because they are at least registered officially and the pricing is transparent.",0
I was with family coming back home after shopping. We called uber the first time ever. The driver probably was drunk. He took totally a wrong route and when we said it's wrong he said he has to follow the directions which were shown on his uber device. He just kept driving and suddenly we found our selves on highway. I got worried and ask him to call some one he said he can't do that. He was driving so rough and just kept going on the highway. We asked him to just stop and let us go but he said he can't coz he won't get paid then. At last we have to tell him that if he doesn't stop we will call 911. He just suddenly applied the breaks and we escaped the accident by mere inches. Finally he let us got off whrn we said we will pay him in cash and we realized we were in some different city. We took a taxi and came home. Uber charged us the extra fare and the trip cost us 130 $ what would have been just 12-15$. The worst and scariest experience of my life. So please just be careful as anyone can register with uber so you never know who you gonna trust.,1
"My girlfriend use this frequently but every single time that I used this service I had bad experiences. Usually the drivers don't know the city at all and they always take the longest route, in order to charge the maximum fare. Also, I have bad experience dealing with rude drivers.",1
I found this morning that I was charged almost $40 for a ride I did not take. At 10PM last night I was sleeping. I have been told to go through Support email to get this resolved but I have not been replied and I have now been disabled from the system and to get back on I have to go through Support which is exactly the email I have not been replied from. FU@&! these people. I spend at least $200/mth with these fools and have a 5 Star rating.. Hello Lyft!,0
"You can't pay cash on Uber, so you can't control how much they put on your card. A driverthat Uber seems to support is to not show your trip as ended. So. The driver picked up my girlfriend and dropped her at my house, both addresses were input in the App, but she got no receipt that day as the trip according to Uber wasn't ended until over 20 hours and 50 miles. I assume the driver defrauded us, or there was a glitch in their software, but after days of correspondence and sending a copy of the receipt, I still get the run-around. I fought for Uber to be allowed here in Miami as the cabs were horrible. Now the cabs are better, and I can avoid being scammed using Uber!",1
"The driver drove me a distance of what would have been a $10 cab ride and charged $35.00 and that's not the worst part. He tried to charge my credit card $1850.00 and $1200.00. Luckily Discover card caught it, flagged it and denied it. The charge was attempted through a company called Lavish Limos.",1
After a night out got a taxi through uber at normal rate twice and both times said on route but then cancelled the pick up for no reason? Then the price surge occurred and we were picked up and dropped off meaning a Â£25-30 dare then became over Â£60 customer support not existant uber is dreadful company to deal with,0
uber is nothing but a fraudulent piece of shi t low life mother$#*!in thieving dog$#*! useless leach sucking peoples money dry $#*!I EM,0
Uber is not good for the country because they are taking off the marker traditional taxis which we need in the London. We are better off without uber and use our black taxis like we use.,0
"After buying a new Corolla and doing all the necessary documentation to join Uber, worked for 2 months than the mileage rate dropped and couple weeks ago opened the App to start taking rides I was not allowed to use it till I had agreed to a 25% cut instead of a prior 20% just because I have joined after October 29th 2015. So now I get 0.75$ per mile and 0.10$ per minute. That's BS 6$/hr for driving is under minimum wage considering that the minimum wage in MD is 8.25$/hr",0
"Normal Taxi fare from my home to airport is $25. I was struggling with Windows app on my new Windows phone, and it was my first use of the app on my new phone. I was not quoted the fare price before agreeing to pay the surcharge, which I did under duress, as I was running late due to faulty phone app... it would not even accept my home address as pickup location, kept changing it. I did not have time to request a taxi, so I agreed to pay under duress. I request a partial refund from customer service and they said no. Many reviews of their Windows app are negative. I also give a negative review of their customer service.",0
"Uber seemed to be ideal since I just moved back home to Columbus, and I'm a single full time parent. Uber's App sent me to fictitious addresses, wrong addresses, and refused to accept responsibility for the wasted time, fuel, and deficiencies of their own App. The passengers constantly complained to me about the App's functionality, and the inability of contacting Uber Customer Support. The cost of driving for Uber is too high. Car payment, fuel, oil changes, Uber Fee, and Passenger Fee, leaves minimum wages for the driver. While Uber claims that drivers can make great money, it's actually Uber that is making ""great"" money!! Charging drivers high fees on top of maintenance costs of their own vehicles is ridiculous!",0
"My account has been suspended by Uber (I don't know why), there drivers are always late, poor quality cars and a costumer support which never replies to your emails. A big no to Uber, your days in India are counted. May your company get dumped, Uber.",0
"I have enjoyed Uber until 03/14/2016. Now I'm done. I'm at a Marriott in DC. Driver calls and asks where I am. I'm in front. He says no you're not. He realizes he is not at the front entrance and tells me to walk around back. I said no. He said then cancel the trip. I cancelled, rebooked, the same driver took the route! I cancelled again and took a taxi. Uber charged me $5 each for the cancellations. YOU CAN NOT CONTACT ANYONE WITH UBER. It was easy to get a credit, but not a refund. YOU STEAL MY MONEY AND GIVE ME A CREDIT! Never again Uber. I will never use Uber again.",1
My account was hacked and my card was charged twice. When I tried to dispute the charges I couldn't get through by phone and I didn't get an email back. I had to call my bank and they disputed the charges but still could not get in contact with Uber. I will never trust them again.,0
"I do not user. My business partner does. Last week in LA I agreed to let her get an Uber to take us to the airport. We saw the car pass the location once and I said, ""We're in trouble already."" The driver came around the block. Pulled up. We had a lot of bags. He didn't lift a finger to help. After loading the trunk I got in the rear passenger side door. While sitting there waiting for my partner to get in the other door I saw him put the car into Drive. I almost said something thinking to myself this guy wouldn't start going before everyone was in the car. WRONG. HE STARTED ROLLING. LUCKILY MY PARTNER, WHO COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED, WAS NOT. He stopped the car. I said, 'We're out of here.' Once again, surprise, surprise he didn't help us take anything out. UBER IS DANGEROUS. THEIR DRIVERS ARE NOT PROFESSIONAL. THEIR DRIVERS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO KNOW ANYTHING (ALWAYS RELYING ON THEIR PHONE MAPPING APS) AND THEY DON'T CARRY ANY MORE INSURANCE THAN A NORMAL DRIVER. This situation ended okay, although stressful. But the next time....",1
I schefuled a pickup on Miami Beach waited much longer than was quoted on the map. The map kept changing time to a longer period. After a while I called the driver to see where he was and he said in Spanish that he didn't speak English. I canceled the trip and tried to schedule another and the price went from $16 to $43. I called Central taxi and had a car in 3 minutes for less money. I seriously doubt I'll use Uber again.,1
"When I started driving UBER, on the surface it looked good. It became very obvious, very faster than obvious, what UBER is really about, NOT: ""Delivering Quality Rides""! UBER is to deliver cheap, fast transportation, on the costs of its drivers, by allowing every dumb*** to rate the professionalism of Drivers. And what is that? Putting up with a rider's: - dumb comments - insults - arrogance - unfair demands - demand to break traffic rules - impatience and then still feed the rider with free sweets, drinks and accept to receive a low rating because you didn't look like the rider would have wished you look like, etc., Very professional, UBER. Now go to hell. UBER will end up with the low of low. But that wouldn't place a scratch mark on UBER's executives. By then they will have made their millions and thus, who cares?",0
"I wont ever use uber again, they are very unprofessional and high who ever the hell they want. just recently my friend used an uber to go to her boyfriends when she go in the uber her uber driver asked her if she wanted some water, she said yes. he grabbed some water from the front seat opening it for her. the next thing she knew he turned off the meter and told her it would be free of charge...... the end of the night she was in the hospital getting a rape test done that came back positive.... this uber driver date rape drugged her water and raped her. DONT USE UBER",1
My first ride with Uber went like this. The driver asked me what time my flight was. Naturally I wanted to get there early to check in beat the traffic and to make sure I would get through security on time. My Uber driver took that opportunity to drive around the suburbs to hike up the fare. so he could run into traffic. A 45 minute trip took 1.5 hours. I only made my flight because I sprinted through the airport. Uber sucks,1
I was so excited to work for uber got a nice new car been driving now for 2 months but every nirte I come home so depressed I make about 6 bucks an hour pay for gas please do not be a driver I do not drive for uber any more some one is making big bucks but NOT THE DRIVERS,0
They $#*!ing charge me cancel ride in time.,0
"My wallet was stolen out of an uber last night with my social security card inside and this was the message I sent over 4 hours ago and have yet to recieve a response. I seriously question the legitimacy of this company and strongly advise people not to use the app. I have been a big fan for almost two years but I truly believe there is an underlying issue with this company. Any other customer support system would be much more attentive to the matter and have consideration to help their customers with their best interest in mind. To Uber customer support: I received an unusual phone call from your company this afternoon that made me so uncomfortable that I had to hang up. The man on the phone had a hard time speaking clear English and said that he had contacted the driver but failed to Answer any questions pertaining to the wallet, even when asked directly. The phone call seemed like it was coming from over seas. Unless it was a mock phone call, it has made me begin to question the legitimacy of your company. I have spoken with a lawyer, the police, an investigator, and the attorney general's office. Further action on this matter will be addressed within the next few days because your customer service has failed to make the slightest advancement in helping me. I have been in contact with you for the past 8 hours and have yet to receive the smallest details about my driver, such as his last name, despite the fact that your employee has committed a felony against one of your customers. I am extremely disappointed and will continue to inform everyone I know of this situation and the how unprofessionally it has been handled.",1
Charged me 13$ To get dropped off at airport Could not speak English dropped me off in a parking lot across from airport !! Took uber home from airport got charged 50.73. It's impossible to contact someon there. And it was my second mom English speaking cabbie. Who's car stunk like yellow cabs. Cabbies. Frustrated.,1
Maurice Heyliger in Atlanta area - THIS IS YOU BUDDY! Quote a 40 dollar ride and then upcharge to 150+ afterwards. Nicely done. As you can read from the posts this seems to be a standard business practice. Next time on Shark Tank you can thank that POS Chris Sacca that says he invested in Uber all the time. This company will eventually fail on its own or be sued into oblivion.,0
"Wow! Where do I begin?! I applied to be a driver, I waited, waited, waited&waited some more. I had to contact them in order to find out my status. I don't like giving my info to just anyone. Long story short I was denied&told I should've got my background check. I was given a website to contact the supposed Background company& they couldn't find ANY info on me in their system. MAYBE because I DON'T have much of a criminal background. BUT! You've got this FOOL killing folks for a hobby. REALLY Uber?! Clue me in",0
"If you are contemplating driving for Uber in NJ, think again....maybe 3x. Ask around. All I know from my experience as a driver for three months with 500 trips under my belt and a 4.8 rating........be very very circumspect before leasing a car. What they do is rope you in as a driver with decent pay for two weeks....then wham.....they cut the fares in half. Let me ask you as a logical human being......can a driver who has usually a car payment of at least $600 per month...plus insurance.....(unless the ins. co finds out you drive for Uber and then presto....drops you like a rusty safe in the river) plus gas, and wear and tear on the car driver 10-15 minutes for $3....well that is the fare they pay. Also if you happen to drive to Manhattan......and they take out $20 for toll and charge the customer.....and then only pay you $8-15 on top of that to drop off the customer before you have to drive through traffic to get back into NJ to accept another fare which usually takes at least an hour....do you think that is a good usage of time and good pay? You see what Uber is doing is trying to show Wall Street (Watch ""The Big Short""- very appropo for Uber) the huge rider base. The problem is that the drivers are dropping out like flies because they can not afford to drive. I know as I have picked up many ex drivers recounting the same experience. Wall St......which incidentally I used to work for years ago for almost two decades.....is about to have a rude awakening when they see the market valuation Uber claims of $63 bill. -even though they lost over $467 mill in 2015-from a confidential source yours truly picked up devulged-is nothing more than specious and a ""house of cards"". Now Uber's PR will tell you how wonderful it is to slash fares all in order to be more busy for the drivers but don't believe a word they say. It is because they are burning through drivers faster than the INDIE speedway all in order to keep riders happy. Good luck people in your decision but know that you had better do your homework before you get involved in such an exploitive outfit. BE DAMN CAREFUL.",0
I am currently uber driver. You never believe I drove to BWA for $35 without gas and mileage and tax expenses. It is to customers but not for drivers unless to those they do not math.,0
"Uber is a horrible partner . Dropped its price again for the third time in less than two years and now I'm driving for chump change they want 5 star service for 1 star pay and the math just not working out . Furthermore they have partnered with local dealerships whereas they are taking advantage of people's economic situations leasing cars for outrageous amounts before nobody with bad credit could get approved now that Uber is on the scene miraculously any Uber driver can get approved which begs me to wonder just how sleezy the banks and dealerships are . Uber is a viper taking advantage of a certain demographic low income not educated driver trying to feed there families people say "" Nobody is forcing you ."" and to that I say "" And nobody is forcing me to feed my kids either ."" Don't drive for Uber they are $#*!s period !",0

If you think you're going to make money with uber / think again this is the new form of a slave labor. as a taxi driver you will receive half of what you used to make with the other company if you currently drive for uber you better stop now..they don't care about you . I did it for a year and its not getting any better the price was reduced and the search pricing is a scam goodbye over,0
Urber is awful to work for. A US Army veteran had his job taken from him because of a bad rating what the heck is that ? DO NOT WORK FOR JIVE TIME UBER,0
"24 charges to my card by Uber technologies, none of them on my Uber account, no ""ghost rides"", but $1,200 of bogus charges to Uber. USAA notified me, cancelled card.",0
"This is the 3rd time uber drivers have cancelled my journey and then when I reorder price has mysteriously gone up 3x. It is a joke and it ends up cheaper using a normal minicab, Â£28 instead of Â£60.",1
"Unfortunately though, I recently had a bad experience with a driver service was worse...",1
because they charged from my credit cart 3 times and i never can take money back. Uber taxi driver forced me to pay in the car. He said Uber will not charge but they charged two more times. I sent them my statement I am talking with them it is not working out. Do not use Uber because serial killer could drive you too,1
Need to watch where the driver going. This is the 2nd time for me where the driver trying to bring you around even though his map showing the faster way to get to your destination. Even though there is no traffic and closed road.,1
"1 star because they don't have a 0 star option..I have a previous post about uber stranding me up at 11:00 PM and I had to walk 5 miles to get home about 2:00 AM-- I was pissed. I cancelled uber-go figure. I went to an event at the Fairgrounds in West Palm Beach and I stopped at a tabel promoting uber. I told the nice guy my issue. He reset the account tested it - all good.Need to get to Ft. LAuderdale Airport Mon.16 2016.I want a ride to the Tri Rail station.Once again I see on my cell screen, uber cars close,my credit card last 4 numbers, my pickup address and uber will not send someone because they do not recognize my number, which they have previously. So now I'm late and hit the mean streets arrive at FLL in time and now going to pay about $80.00 for parking when I get back. Way to go uber-- grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr",1
"Uber is pretty good for riders - a real scam for drivers, wear out your car for less than minimum wage in most cities - - the amount they ""claim"" one can earn is a lie and a few drunk riders will bring your rating with Uber so low they will fire you - - thank you Uber for firing me",0
Uber driver has let the meter on even after the ride was completed. I lost my money because of this. He rode a good 2hrs on the road. Wrote to the customer support multiple times but no one seems to care as soon as I explained my situation. They didn't even bother to reply.,1
Uber takes out all hard earned money of the driver and encashs persons need They deduct around 35-40% for the fate charges For ex if the fate was $10.00 for 3 miles 20 min journey in downtown Uber takes close to $4.00 and gives the uber driver $6.00 In the $6 driver spends his time drives his own CST on his own maintenance and buys gas in his own Please don't take uber,0
"Uber doesn't care if you have a problem with their driver; the person on the phone promised me a $20 credit but never applied it to my account; I sent them a complaint via email, they never even acknowledged the email. I missed a flight because of the complete incompetence of their driver, who didn't speak English AND went to the Fort Lauderdale airport for the first time in his life AND doesn't know the difference between Arrivals and Departures at the airport (first took me to the airport hangar, then to the airport parking, then finally found the terminal but dropped me off at the arrivals and I missed the flight by 3min.). I spent extra $150 because of him, for the hotel and getting to the airport in the morning, not to mention the upheaval it caused me at work; and they didn't even respond to my email??",1
"The pickup time on the Uber app fluctuated between 3 minutes to 10 then 18 minutes and back to 5 for over an hour. The Uber car never showed, neither did the cabs I called to pick me up from a retirement community in West Palm Beach two days after my father died. I missed my flight and now I'm worried Uber will charge my card or use it illegally since the app requires you to input your payment information into their system before the car pickup is authorized. At least the cabs I called don't have me locked into a financial trap. Definitely not a fan of a business taking my personal information without providing me a service. I selected a 1 for rating only because this site requires a rating but Uber gets a Zero from me.",1
Tonight at 1 am while coming back from phoenix market city i put my phone on charging and forgot to take it...i called the cab driver after 15 mins asking for the phone and he started giving random excuses....i called the police as well and plan to file an fir tomorrow morning...his name is manjunath and his number is 8494844422,1
These uber drivers have no experience and who knows if the driver is on drugs or selling drugs in his car. Government is actually making it easier for public to easily access drugs. Taxi drivers are more reliable because they go through proper training! Taxi drivers have commercial insurance and their cars are inspected by county officers whereas uber doesn't even have enough customer service representatives. What would government do if one of these uber drivers rape or kill somebody or kidnap one of their clients for ransom and who knows if it's the same driver and these drivers don't even have to go through any kind of training. This uber put lot of taxi drivers out of work! i don't think it's fair because this uber service is just extra money for some greedy people. Taxi drivers were working hard to raise their families so i think government should think about those families and ban uber and lyft forever so people can feel more safe!,1
"While I understand all of the cab-hating, the one point I worry about is insurance with Uber et al. This article talks about major injuries people experienced. Do these new startups have the same level of insurance coverage as traditional cabs are required to have? What will happen when the news starts reporting catastrophic injuries passengers receive in an Uber subscribed vehicle, but having to be on Medicaid because there was no insurance in place?",0
"More than once I've had to witness UBER drivers not following the laws of the road. For instance - one driver was driving on top of bicycle lanes and areas not meant for moving cars; another time, another driver was on a side street at a stop sign but made an inappropriate gesture with his hand and halted traffic moving along a busy road so that he could cross over despite not having the right of way. It's not just infuriating, it is beyond unsafe to have these untrained, unregulated, unruly drivers be allowed to engage in such a profession and endanger the lives of others. They might have provided faster service, and maybe this is what they think will give them better ratings and reviews, but I would rather be alive and it is beyond shameful that UBER does nothing to discourage and prevent this sort of recklessness.",1
No action is being taken on tricky deceitful drivers sucking the passengers,1
Can uber driver park in front of britomart station or not .... driver name was Sid and Car number 63 Can I get immediately update on his $#*! response .... otherwise I will find other way,1
"My daughter, a college student went out and had expected her ride to be $37.00 home as it had been in the past. As a result of you ""price surge policy"" she was charged $160.00! It was 1 am, pouring rain so she had no other options at that point or she would not have used Uber. The thing is, she and her friend never expected it to cost so much, and like so many other peopIe are stuck, desperate and are open to being gouged and taken advantage of. I have used uber as well for over a year and a half. My boyfriend also registered to become a driver but decided not to follow through. I am sad to say I disagree with your surge policy. I can understand a ""surcharge""--even doubling the fare but this was unreasonable. Needless to say, I will no longer continue to use your service and will in the future advise all of my clients (I own a hair salon and spa) not to use uber. I have spoke highly of your service in the past but can't continue to give a good or even fair review.",0

"At about 11pm my friends and I ordered an uber that was about $30. At 3am i ordered another uber to go back to our initial destination in which we took the same route, same distance, same everything and it was $86.!!!! On top of that, it was my first ever uber ride under my name and card so I SHOULD have received a first time uber user free ride, but the app never gave me one... So obviously I googled a different promo code that gave me $15 discount. So my uber fare would have been $100! I might as well have taken a taxi or risked driving my own car for 3x cheaper than uber. I thought uber was supposed to be a cheaper, easier, efficient alternative to getting a taxi or even renting a car? I will say my experience was polar opposite. I'm never using uber under my name ever again. My driver was nice though, a nice car too. But he took 15 minutes longer than my first driver and he barely spoke English. He also took 10 minutes longer than the ETA to get to us. So here I am emailing uber back and forth asking them to honor their first time user free ride. $86 is NOT WORTH IT.",1
It's only good to make the referral money on use my code to sign up and I'll split it with u b5gve,0
This is worse than yellow cab.,0
"After ordering out uber, we had waited quite awhile and could see on the App she continued to sit at the gas station down the road for 15 minutes. I called to ask her if she was still coming and she yelled at me ""I'm $#*!ing driving down the road to get your $#*!ing ass you $#*!"" after that I told her to cancel the drive because I did not want to ride with someone who was so rude and disrespectful. She needed up charging me anyways. I am not one to write reviews but this was the worst service/ person I have ever had to deal with.",1
The founders and management of Uber have gotten rich on the backs of poor drivers who don't know how to calculate the full cost of driving for Uber. They make a very tiny percentage or they often lose money because Uber pays them LESS than the true cost of driving and maintaining a vehicle in the U.S.,0
For a ride downtown it was $19.84...to get us home on an event night they were going to charge us 6 to 7 times the normal rate which would have been $120 to $140 ish. They should be ashamed of themselves...I certainly will not recommend them to anyone. They should be required to disclose this information.,0
"What a joke. I had been using uber for months and loved it... until one day when I was requesting a ride home from the store I ubered to and I got error message saying my card was invalid. After 2 weeks of emails with employees that don't seem to be able to read English, and being told the problem was fixed numerous times, it was never resolved. They don't deserve anyone's business. A family member drove for them for several weeks and quit because he never got paid. They're not even good to their employees.",0
"I booked a taxi through UBER, he arrived within about 10 minutes. He drove past me and the on the app I seen him driving in circles. I tried calling him. Then he called me and said he could no longer do my journey and that I must press cancel on the app and order another one. Bare in mind this is on New Years Eve, a 23 year old girl alone, with no coat, visiting her sick mother in hospital. I cancelled it on the app as he advised as I could not be bothered arguing, and it charged me Â£4 for cancellation even though I did not want to cancel it, he said I had to! As they are ignoring my emails, my bank are recovering the funds. I would rather give the Â£4 to charity rather than these con-men!",1
My 18 yr old daughter a college student was charged $250 for a ride that cost $45 on the way there. It was her first time using UBER and was not informed of the surcharge which they said was 2.8X but by my math 5X+ her cost their. There should be laws to prevent such gouging - SHAME ON YOU>,0

Never have i been in contact with such rude people, looks like I'm back with taxis.",1
Uber is an absolute rip off. Their price guides never meet their much higher fares charged. You never know what they charged you until you check your credit card. Most times more than a taxi. Rip off on nye was mind boggling. I won't be using them anymore. Best to see an honest fare on a meter.,0

I had to have some surgery 3miles from my house a couple of fridays ago in Plano TX. My friend set up Uber since i could not drive for 24hours and she cannot drive at the moment. The Uber account was in her name and account..nice guy picked us up..drove 3miles to surgery center..i asked my friend how much was the service...she stated it was on her credit card. The driver said we could call him direct and he would give us a cheaper rate for the drive home a few hours later. I'm still loopy on anesthetia but my frjend tells me tge roundtrip was 70.00!!! WTF?! For 6miles roundtrip...are you kidding me?! I slept off my drugs..then next day told her we were highly ripped off..and she needs to lose that driver's number..and i need to findout how to lodge a complaint. Well I do not have an account..so i cannot set a complaint..if i want to set up an account...and give them my credit card number..then i can lodge a complaint..I am not about to give them my credit card number!!!! So make sure you get an rate estimate ahead of time...maybe in writting.. I am going to my friend and request her account info so I can lodge a proper complaint. There was no inclement weather...no high time or traffic nothing to warrant such overages. I will keep you posted and if no satisfaction i will post you the driver's name and number..to avoid this guy...DANG,0
"Too many times now an Uber driver has come to pick me up, discovered where I want to go, refused to take me, kicks me out of car and I still get billed five bucks from Uber. It's a fricking joke. Of course after a long series of emails Uber eventually gives me the five bucks back but continue to allow their drivers to rip people off. After all, UUber gets their cut so why take these drivers off the road.",1
"I used Ãber a few months ago when I needed a ride after I turned in my lease. My leasing agent made arrangements for an Ãber driver to return me to my home. I had no idea that Uber drivers used their own personal vehicles to transport their customers. When the Ãber driver showed up he was on time. However his car was another story. It was an old well worn Ford Fusion that reeked from those cheap car interior deodorizers. The car was running poorly and was making a terrible whine at freeway speeds. I was gritting my teeth the entire ten mile ride wondering if this old clunker was going to detonate at any second. Also, I didn't appreciate having to listen to a forty minutes of reggae music thumping away either. In the past I have used Yellow Cab which has always been a favorable experience. Needless to say I would never, ever set foot into another Ãber vehicle.",1
"CAUTION!!!! Don't be ripped off by UBER. I was invited to use a $25 discount on my first ride. I tried to check this discount before I booked the taxi and my account just showed a discount was applied. To be sure I tried to use a code I was given that was for a $15 discount. So, I took my first ride from downtown to Pittsburgh Int'l Airport. The fare was $49!!!! It was on a Monday at about 1:00. Instead of the promised $25, I was only give $5. I ordered an UberX and what came was UberXL. My fare was twice the amount my husband paid a few days earlier. Yellow cab would have been $40 and the super shuttle would have been $25. I have tried to work with Uber to straighten this out. I have even sent pictures of the offer for $15 off and yet they only took $5 off my first ride. BE WARNED. . .verify your discount and fare. DO NOT TRUST this company. Check and double check. Yes, the car was nice and the driver was very pleasant. But, they use bait and switch to cheat the consumer!!",0

"When I put in a request for an Uber driver, one driver responded and called me and said he is not allowed to pick me up at the Westchester county airport and drop me off in Westchester. He directed me to put in a destination outside of Westchester. I did not do this as I felt it was a scam and I would be charged a higher amount because the amount of the fare would be calculated based on a further destination. When I declined his direction I requested an Uber driver again and a different driver told me to do the same as the first. I declined again feeling it was a scam and took a regular taxi at that point. Scamming passengers is a horrible way to do business.",0
This Uber driver in the Arcadia CA area in a black Lexus license plates 7HLN158 instead of making a right turn on a right turn only lane almost hit my car and started honking at me flick me off so I took a pic of his plate then he followed me into a shopping center to verbally attack me and he did all this with passengers in his car be careful if you get him as a driver his an aggressive and dangers driver.,1

"The first week I drove for Uber I said 'Uber is fantastic'. The fourth week, 'it is not bad'. The sixth, 'something is not right'. The seventh, 'these guys are crooks and not worth doing this $hit'. Finally on the eighth I call it quit. Uber customer will get fantastic service with nice clean car. Of course they are impressed and leave utmost positive reviews. But do not generalize Uber's image with over enthusiastic service provided by continously supplied victims as newbies from the hungry pool of population. Uber is a new form of scam. Like Maddof, Enron, etc. I am glad I got out quick.",0
"If they call you and find out that surge price, they are just not show up and make you wait.

Uber customer bad is super tarible, Lyft is a lot better. Uber back up rider, lyft back up driver. Uber can not tip driver, lyft can, if you appreciate driver. My score on lyft is higher than uber.",0
"I am done with Uber! Have been using them for couple of months in NYC, until very recently most drivers were fine though I was never a fan of the surge pricing (I paid over $40 for less than 2 miles). Early this week I called for a car, supposed to be a 5 minute wait turned into 20 minutes. I texted and called the driver multiple times but no response. Then he cancelled the ride without my consent, and had the nerve to charge me a $10 fee! Why should I pay for no service, especially the driver was the one who cancelled, not me! He was a no-show and I ended up walking few blocks to catch a cab and late for a meeting, after wasted close to half an hour waiting! The worse thing is, there isn't a customer service number to call. I emailed Uber support and they took a while to respond. I was offer a ride credit but I demanded a refund, as I had no intention to use them again. I filed disputes with both PayPal and my credit card, then all of a sudden Uber freezed my account. They have multiple agents contacting me and asked for photo ID and credit card copy...why would I do that? It's fraud waiting to happen, and can't be legal! I have sick of the way to treat their customers and how they conduct business. I am going to file a complaint with the BBB also, I will not use them again.",1
"I need to warn all of you Uber drivers about Ubers $1,000 00 deductible through their insurance coverage. I was on my way to pick up a passenger when I was hit by another vehicle. Right away, I reported it to Uber in the San Francisco office. A staff member insisted I contact my insurance company and report it to them. I insisted this was not appropriate since I was on my way to a pick-up a Uber rider. After much-to-do, I finally contacted my insurance company and they informed me I have no coverage at the time since I was picking up a Uber passenger. Afterwards, I went back to the Uber office at which time the Uber rep. informed me that I had a $1,000.00 deductible through Uber's insurance. The upshot is that I was lucky the other ddriver had insurance. Since it was urgent I get back on the road and I knew Uber's staff would not get me back on the road for several weeks, I decided to take the issue in hand myself and contacted the other driver's insurance company to get the repairs done. I hope Uber drivers are able to unionize in the Bay Area. With a union backing Uber drivers, we won't be denied customer tips, and employee support for such things as insurance coverage with no deductible while on Uber time, better wages for the wear and tear on our cars, mileage reimbursment for travel time back to the original customer pick-up if we can't get a fare back to the original pick up or within 6 miles of origiinal pick up. Regarding Uber's Customer Service to their drivers - service is below par. Also, please be aware, with no notification, Uber will shut you down as a driver if you report an accident to them until you obtain another vehicle inspection.",0
Most unreliable service you will ever find. I was left waiting for a car for over an hour even though it showed the driver only being a few minutes away. Terrible service. Do not use uber. I would rate them zero if I could.,0
"I USE to drive for Uber but no more. Uber screws their drivers over...especially when they offer the guaranteed rates. You can never find out exactly how you're doing to see if you still qualify for the guarantee so you have to continue driving the entire 30-50 hrs to find out you did not qualify because of some stupid technicality....like 89.3% acceptance rate. They also screw over their customers. I had a rider get into my car by mistake so she still wanted to ride with me. When she cancelled her original request they charged her a $5 fee & when she put in another request while sitting in my car it gave her a different driver so she had to keep cancelling those drivers while being charged a cancellation fee until the uber app gave her my car as the right driver. Unlike Lyft, Uber does not pay too fees either.",0
"I will never be using Uber again, and I registered a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Uber charged my credit card for a cancellation when it is THEIR driver who cancelled, not me. I thought it was a good faith mistake, but what was their rectification? ""Future credits"". Appalling! They took MY MONEY, and now they want me to use their service to get MY MONEY back. My only regret is that I cannot do more than register my BBB complaint, plaster my situation on social media, and stop using their service. What they are doing is illegal. Yes, it was only $5. But, they do not have a right to take $5 out of my pocket while not delivering any service to me. Again, THEIR DRIVER CANCELLED! Is this a new business model for them? Have their drivers cancel and charge the customers money so they make money without having to spend any time delivering the service? Incredible. I have removed all valid credit cards from this account so they can't steal more money from me, as they have proven they will do so. I have deleted their app from my phone. I have emailed them to have my account deleted, and I want nothing more to do with such a shady business. I will tell everyone I possibly can about this. They are a terrible, unethical company for stealing money from their loyal customers.",1

I was charged $215 for a half hour trip. My phone died and I never relized I was going to pay that much. They suck you in with a cheap fare short distance then thay hit you hard with a big fare. Completely unfair and dishonest system. I will tell all my friends and family not to use this service.,0
"I've been driving for Uber in the Midwest for eight months. My average hourly income after gas is about $7/hr. On short trips, Uber takes about 50 percent of the fare. In my city, that means I pocket $2.35 a ride. The fifty percent comes from $1.80 Safe Ride charge and then 20% of what remains. You can expect 2-3 trips an hour. Longer trips are more profitable percentage wise, but not much. During surge pricing 3X and up you can do ok, but surge times are limited and you can only expect a few surge rides a night. Last night was very average for me. Six hours, 100 miles, $40. Two surge rides, but only 1.8X. I'm sure some of the larger markets are better, longer average trips, more surge, etc, but not really worth the time in a city smaller than Dallas, Houston, etc. The Uber concept is great for riders, drivers and mostly Uber. I really enjoy driving for them. I put this out there so any prospective driver knows what to expect. I'm sure over time as Uber finds it harder and harder to find drivers that the compensation schedule will change. Until then I'll just Uber around for beer money and call it good.",0

They say that Uber pricing ""surges"" (increases up to 10 times) based on supply (number of cars) and demand (number of request). I can tell you it's all BS! Uber raises prices when....it wants to! Doubt me? Take out your rider app....look at a area that is surging and see how many cars are in the area....now watch as more cars show up and maybe at best a small percentage of drivers get riders. I've literally seen Uber raise price up to 4.8 times normal rate and saw one out of ten drivers in the surge area get a ride. It's all BS and I have over 2,000 screenshots to prove it!!!!

Yesterday was the first and last time I use Uber. Our first driver kept asking us where to go even though he had his gps telling him where to go. Our second driver last night could not find us and kept telling me that I gave him a wrong address when in fact he too could not use gps as well. After 20 min of directing him to us we finally began the trip home. Again we had to direct him all the way because he could not read his gps. WOW! Then came the charge....more than double what we paid for the first ride. Nothing I hate more than having to pay someone to do their job. Good riddens to Uber!,1
"do not use Uber for long distance, they are totally over rated, I believe the drivers understand time is a portion of the rate, not going to say they slowed down, but it sure look like. You could take a ride in a Limo from the airport, I dare say it will cost $180.00 I cancelled my account and the customer service people does not know the difference between a complaint and a request. Cab folks in Chicago you probably have nothing to worry about, this may be just a flash. Service will win out.",0
"we had a need to move a driver from our lot to the shop to bring buses back (after repair). It seemed feasible to use Uber so noone had to drive the driver back and forth and waste time. First time we use Uber, we were charged $19 for 6 miles distance (18 minutes drive). Next time we were charged $15 for same mileage, same time. Third time we were charged $36 for the same distance same time of travel. We reached out to Uber to find out why and their reply was because a BLACK car showed up. We had no idea about the scam they are running. They sent a black car and doubled the price when we all needed was the cheapest ride from point A to point B. This company is a rip off/scammer. We will never use their services again and we do not recommend them either. It would have been cheaper to just take a taxi for such close distance.",0

"I used UBER to take me from MIA to my home in Miami Beach, the car took 35 mins to arrive to the terminal. The driver that showed up was probably around 21, dressed in shorts, sandals and reeked of marijuana (did not smell it until a few minutes into ride - he had sprayed something in the car just before we got in), he got lost even though he was using a mapping APP and I was directing him. The car he was driving was a Chrysler 300, it had huge ghetto rims, I was seriously mortified being dropped off at my house. The car also had a huge speaker in the trunk, thank God I only had a small case otherwise it would not have fit and I would have needed to call a regular cab. I will not use them again, I did not feel safe and it was just a few bucks cheaper than a regular cab or car service.",1
"Uber was wonderful when it entered the market offering an option to the not so exciting cab rides in our city. But since its arrival so many things have become apparent regarding their scam! Cabbies are using this as their sole income- I've heard of maybe 1 successful uber driver who stayed longer than 6 months and wasn't doing it part time. Cabbies never surge charged (though if Uber fails this may be a unwanted result to even the playing field between the two)- unfortunately there were enough cabbies that did stupid things but many are not trying to scam you- especially now that competition has put them back where they need to be. Most reputable cab companies have strict vehicle regulations- I haven't meet many share riding drivers who even know how to change their own oil- and I'm hoping into their ""maintained vehicle."" Take a risk where you want. Saving a buck per mile isn't worth hoping into some strangers seat whose company is not held responsible for their actions as it has so frequently flaunted.",0
UBER Warning!!!!! BE WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! UNAUTHORISED CHARGE TO CREDIT CARD!!!! we did a quote for a trip in Brisbane $35!! When we booked they ADDED $50 EXTRA to the bill without advising us. The charge just went straight to our Credit Card. So a $35 trip was charged at $95...... $45 for the trip (higher than quoted) $50 surge charge. NO phone number to call so we emailed them and they said SORRY NO REFUND!!!! They can charge anything they want to your credit card. They call it a SUrge Charge... a charge they can add when they are busy. They say they tell you but the drive avoided the question when asked what the cost would be.... Its such a pity as it would be an awesome service but you cant be sure what they will charge. JUSt BE WARNED!!!!!!,0

I tried to use the Uber app to schedule a pickup at the EWR Marriott hotel in NJ. The app REFUSED to pick me up at the hotel and wanted me to hike all the way to the terminal for a pickup. Why bother with Uber; I can just get the hotel to call a taxi that will pick me up at the door.,0
"Used Uber for the first time this last Sunday around 10 am from Chicago O'Hare Terminal 3 to Hoffman Estates. Unpleasently surprised by the Fare Cost of $76.94. (Uber's Meter Fare:$60.50 - Gratuity:$12.49 - Booking fee: $2.00 .) It was an Uber Taxi not a private car. I could not see an estimated fare at the time of booking the car. I took a leap of faith. Driver was Ok, not clear in communication but not rude. I'm a frequent flyer and normally pay 35-38$ for the same distance + $10 Tip (on average under $50.00 for private cars). My objection is not with tolls or tip but with Meter Fare. (The driver ran the meter during the ride and the total came out to be around $32). Sent an Email for explanation of high fare and some Gonzalo from Uber's help.uber.com replied, with ""Uber TAXI is a unique option where rates are not set by Uber. We at Uber are unable to control or adjust these fares."" Reading from other people's experience here on this forum makes me realize that this 'fare gouging' happens more often. I have to say, I am totally turned off by their practice and will not use it in future.",0
"i got a cab coming and saying he is an uber, later when we arrived he said that he is actually an uber taxi and i have to pay as it goes not to be cherged from account as normal uber. i said that i dont have money and i specifially asked him if he is an uber so i can use my paypal account and he said yes",1
"October 31st at 11:01PM, we requested an Uber pickup in Fort Lauderdale, FL. Immediately we received a text that said since it was a busy time, there would be a surcharge and our fare would be 2x the normal amount. We agreed since it was Halloween and a busy time. 11:01PM we received a text that Uber was arriving. Uber did not show up. We text Uber twice to let them know we were in front of a restaurant which is easy to find. 11:20PM we called and spoke with the Uber driver who said he was in traffic and would be there in two minutes. 11:31PM still no Uber driver. We hailed a taxi who did not charge us double and we cancelled the Uber trip. Uber emailed us to let us know that our credit card was charged $5 for cancellation. We went onto Uber account and let them know this was not acceptable. Uber customer service gave us a credit of $5 toward the next Uber trip, and would not refund the $5. Uber gives service that is only convenient for them. They surcharge during busy times and do not show up. If we accept businesses treating consumers like this, where will it end?? Are restaurants next to charge us double because we wish to dine at a busy time such as a Saturday night vs a slower Tuesday? This type of treatment is not acceptable. Think about it.",0
"I used Uber for the first time this weekend in New Orleans from the Amtrac to the French Quarter....cost $68.85. Took the taxi on the way back and it was $17.00.

"I recently used Uber got to see the pic of the driver who was coming to get me and my friends, when the driver pulled up she had someone in the passanger seat with her there was 4 of us guys for this Uber ride, she told me she didn't know there was going to be 4 of us and said the passanger was her husband and told him he would have to go to the bar while she dropped us of since there was 4 of us and needed his space too and would be back for him, this made me feel really awkward and now ill take a taxi before calling Uber",1

"Yes a customer gives a driver a back comment to be evil, as that the driver was too slow when only was a the speed limit. What the driver has to do race in the street to make the passenger happy, and get a ticket for speeding. The driver got suspended for a week, and forced to take a class for $60.

"Worst experience I have ever had with customer service, and being screwed over with my money, and my time. With uber taking up to 25% of fare (which I am ok with and agreed to) They should by far be able to hire a few people to answer phones and solve problems. The fares randomly change with no explanation and no response from suppprt. A $25 far turns to a $20 fare out of thin air, and then on top of the missing $5 uber takes its 25%. Great idea and easy app, but many bugs and zero customer support to fix the issues. Just my though, but I was under the impression that the uber fee was for using their technology. Seems to me they need to take a little bit of that money out of their pocket and hire some people to help! Ps. Not looking back for errors, why waste more time after 30 emails and no help.",0
"I have been using Uber for some months now and have always used the service to travel both into and out of the Melbourne CBD - usually travelling in at approx 8pm and returning around 3 or 4am in the morning. The fee is always around $70-80 each way - except for this Saturday where the in bound trip was normal, however I was hit with a $134 bill on the way out, This was due to a suprise 'dynamic pricing' fee that Uber apparently introduce when they want to encourage more drivers onto the streets. I should have checked my 'price indication' however I didnt do this, because I had taken the trip so ofter (er...a couple of hours earlier) and no fee. Driver did not advise of any fee and joke is on me because I didnt read the fine print. Offer by Uber to refund only half of this $60 fee. Not good enough in my opinion. I believe Uber knows that customers would opt for other alternatives if their customers clearly understood that a surprise fee could occur at random, which is why their method to inform is shady. I feel completely ripped off and tricked into losing money I cannot afford to lose.",0
We did get a quote ...it was for after a concert double check and triple check because we had heard they change the price $40 was the price but then they told us at the time of pick up it as $350 because of the time ...that was in the quote ?

Drivers alway are complaining about how the job sucks... i really don't care to hear about your problem. They tell you thier sad story so you will tip them i guess... i don't need a guilt trip with my ride. Get a different job if ypu don't like the one you have... and clean your car once in a while.,1
Filed with the police. (This company needs to check and make sure there employees are legit) I was using Uber for the first time and I thought I was in an Uber vehicle. (They had an uber sign in the window) The driver told me I could only use cash and he gave me a receipt from northside executive LLC $225 to go from The airport to a hotel 11 miles away. Be careful,1
"In the past two weeks, I used Uber twice for one way riding same distance. The price for first time $12.00 and the second time was charged for $54.00. Next time, I rather take taxi with meter and know what you will pay for. Uber should have price quoting before pick up. Reg.is needed to review their fare practice.",0
Uber went from 5% commission - 25% and now they have raised the safety fee to $1 60 per ride. So all in all if you done about $100 worth of work with Uber you are looking at about 60 bucks.,0
"Uber customer service is non existent. They respond with generic responses that you,ve already heard before, word for word. They let the passengers rate you when they are mad about the surge pricing and when you email them about your rating dropping, they send generic responses about the passengers privacy and not being able to disclose ratings and how the rating system is based off your last 500 rides so 1 rating shouldn't hurt you. Yeah fuk you Uber Customer Non Service. Oh and ps, I WILL NOT BE RETURNING ANY MORE LEFT BEHIND CELL PHONES OR WALLETS OR KEYS. Done it 3 times and didn't get a thank you nor compensation from Uber for going out my way to bring the rider their stuff back or for being honest.",0
"I'm visiting NYC and was attempting to get the attention of a taxi driver, and a black Lincoln Continental pulls up with a sheet taped to the right window ""UBER"". The driver said he could take me the 1.5 miles to my destination. I told him I'm not signed up with UBER but heard the rates are better than a taxi. After getting to my destination he told me the charge was $45 plus a tip and I said you've got to be kidding. I asked him to show me how he came up with that and he said he does this everyday and knows the rates. He refused to provide a fare estimate and said the fare was based on what he normally charge. I told him I think his practice is illegal and he started to use profanity towards me while speaking very loud and threatened to call NYC when I asked for the fare estimate. I told my friends about the experience after meeting them and they said the driver isn't supposed to take cash for fares because they get paid through the company. Needless to say I'm extremely upset and will never ever trust this UBER invention again. However I do hope to see the car again and the middle eastern driver. In addition, I'm going to file a report with the Attorney General, BBB and other regulatory agencies.",1
"Used Uber to go 12 miles, simple route from my home to office. I was quoted 12.00 on the application I downloaded. First driver shows up 10 minutes late, wants to cancel on me because he is going in other direction. OTHER DIRECTION.? I thought they were a cab service. Second driver shows up. He is driving a beat up, disgustingly smelly Nissan Sentra. I'd have sworn he sleeps in the car. He speaks zero English, drives horrible. He blew through two stop signs at which point I said, ""stop the car"". I got out, hailed a regular cab. At my office I read that I am charged $37.45 for the 5 mile, horrible Uber trip. I call their office and speak to a young man named Eric, who tells me I experienced ""surge"" pricing. So let me get this straight. You go on the ap, get a price of $12 and then because of some Uber formula, they quadruple the rate?? FRAUD. Unfortunately for Uber, I am an attorney that practices in the field of securities and corporate fraud. I will be on the phone this Monday with my contacts at state and federal levels.

So the uber estimate said that it should cost me no more then $4 . Well I went 1.94 of a mile an the lady charged me 4.85$ 85 cents more then the intended price. I went 2.2 miles an back for 4$ just a week ago. This is preposterous for 4.85$ I could have just Walked or taken the bus an it be cheaper to go to an from my location .

"I have a pending transaction of $156 and $75 from Uber. This was quite the sticker shock when this trips should have only cost $30 each. Neither of which were approved on my card. I have been back and fourth all weekend trying to get this situation resolved. I have spoken with three different representatives in order to get this resolved. It seems that I am just getting passed around an bullied to a point where I feel as if they just want me to be silent and just take whatever they say whenever they feel like responding back to me.

When looking at your trip our records show that: A pricing notification screen displayed a dynamic pricing rate of: x x1.3 This rate was accepted: 07:19:58 PM EDT and The other fare in question of $156. 82 was also taken at a time of surge and was at a rate of 2.8x. This fare was accepted at 07:07:57 PM EDT. Uber states that I ""accepted"" this rate at the time of the trip. Both of these trips have starting time of 3am. Telling me I accepted a price 8 hours before my trip is completely asinine. This pricing surge was not given to me at the time of my trip. How do you conceive that a trip at 3am was given a surge price and agreed upon 8 hours prior? Not only was this complete lie given to me, I also was sent this information as just a statement and nothing more. Uber, you will NOT bully me into paying for this. Something WILL be done!

I was yelling at him to get off the freeway and 30 blocks out of the way he finally got off. And then I told him to stop the meter so he did, and then restarted it at that location. Ummmm excuse me, why should I be paying for 30 blocks OUT OF THE WAY. I just paid 30 extra blocks just to get back to where we started. And then I got charged for BOTH of those mistakes. In addition, when he finally got on the right freeway I had to direct his every step bc he wasn't paying attention and was on the verge of missing every freeway exit. The worst part - uber only refunded me the 8 dollars in the wrong direction and not for the extra 30 blocks back to my starting point. Horrible customer service uber. I shouldn't have to pay to get back to my starting point. I was so mad I took a taxi home instead of my usual uber.",1

They seem to be con artist they engage you in conversation so you will like them and give them a good rating, when trip is at the destination it will continue to charge you - so if they drive off without completing the trip it's more money for them.. More money. Scammers and con artist. lesson learned!! I end up changing my email and shutting down my bank card. They were literally over charging me and taking it right out of my account.

"Uber the rating game Hi, I was so excited when I heard about uber and join the team I was very proud in one month I did at lease 50 trips. It started a little ruff in the beginning because you have to get to know the GPS and that sometimes it goes crazy in certain places and you don't know what to do but do my best to get the rider to his destination safe. So I had a few problems and some customers are not fair weather they are having a bad day or not feeling well or just disgusted with life itself. Uber should really try to communicate with there partners and see if they can help a driver and hear what they say about the passenger. I own a 2001 2 door Acura and I had to purchase a newer vehicle to drive and so the passengers were comfortable my way of providing good service. I did my best and that was not good enough because of how customers rated us and there comments. The sad part was that I rated almost everybody with a 5 star ratting. So I get an email that my account was deactivated . I was loving my job and was trying to improve without Uber help. I lost a job I love due to customers with no heart and a company that does not care about the uber driver. I hope this help someone and be careful cause the Uber driver has more to loose. I lost my job and I'm in debt with a 2012 vehicle. Julio guzman Email- guzzman2@hotmail.com",0
"Between comparing themselves to airlines and hotels at peak season who raise theirs rates which they do but never by 5.9 percent of a normal fare or room charge. Dynamic Pricking ,Surge charge and robot customer service with scripted replys they are a rip off. They are not transparent at all in their pricing. They charged $250 at 11PM for a ride that cost $30 twelve hours earlier. The driver took full advantage of the fact there were many riders looking for rides. There were also ample drivers available He raised his surge until someone accepted. There was no disclosures or an idea that he was charging $250. It is not clear what surge charge is It only states 5.9x. 5.9x of what. When you take a ride twelve hours earlier for $30 no one would expect to pay $250 for the same ride. Beware and make sure you know what you will pay before accepting a driver. They are allowed to rake you over the coals",1
"I have tried on 2 separate occasions to get a ride home from Uber. The first time, the driver cancelled the ride when he saw that I had a cart full of groceries. I was charged for that cancellation, but later given a $5 credit. When I went to use Uber again, the driver was in front of me, pulled up. I waved and he pulled away. I watched him around my apt complex. after that, I was charged $5 I was asked to rate the driver. How can one rate a driver when you did not even get in the car? That driver was given 1 star for not even attempting to contact me and for just driving by a couple of times. I was waiting outside before he got there. Literally, he was only 2 ft in front of me when he pulled up. He saw me and left. The last time I tried to use Uber again for a ride home from the grocery store (I contacted customer service about being left at the store the first time and was told that it would not happen again) Well, it did. The driver never showed and never bothered to contact me. He cancelled the ride once he got there. I requested Uber again, he cancelled the ride immediately. No charge for either cancellation. So, if there is any Uber driver's out who can answer this... since Uber customer support does not answer it directly. Does Uber not pick up customers from grocery stores?",1
"This may be the biggest scam of the century. First off you could make more selling skis in Hawaii. You start the day by putting $30 in gas so you figure no problem I will make it back and guess what you will but thats it. Have had many days working 10-12 hours just to make $100 after their fee and the gas you walk away with $50 here is the kicker you get to run your car into the ground. Uber is a wake up call if you have ended up here your life is not going as planned. You need to change course I find myself scared to go eat off the dollar menu cause it will take me several fares to make it back. What is very sad is many people come to Uber needing money and bank on this opportunity being what it claims but it is not it is pure lying,greedy,bull$#*!.",0
"Ãber will Neve get a dime of my money, I would rather call a taxi. They have no customer service, they do not care about correcting any issues. They pretend to need all of this information to research, when they have no intention on getting back or just placing a call to you. I will never use their service again for overcharging me, and charging me a cancellation fee when Their driver decided to cancel the ride! BBB and every other outlet will be notified",0

"Uber's ratings of its Partners is irrational. 4 out of 5 is 80 percent. The founders probably didn't score 100 percent in college. The overall rating of Uber is not a 5 star. Uber platform to send the Partners out without training is expectation is fatal. Why allow the companies ratings to fall immediately with new Partners. The riders are Mal Contemps and not happy with a good, friendly, and safe ride. All new Partners should be required to attend the four hour training. Uber changed its policy on evaluation mid stream and changed from the 500 ride minimum to a 50 ride minimum. Once a Partner gets de-activated they are treated as if they are a criminal, second class citizen. Uber does not care about the negative publicity or terminating a Partner.",0
"Twice I have tried to set up an Uber account, most recently 2 days ago. That took 2+ hours. When I contacted uber for a ride, the user name and password were not recognized. Clicking the link to reset the password, it took Uber nearly 3 hours to respond and with no link to reset the password. The company is undependable and not user friendly, especially if one will not use Facebook. As of more than 12 hours later, there is still no link to reset the password. Forget even trying to get a live body on the phone.",0
I have comment about the rating system its not fare and its not based on fixed points and work is not stable with uber,0
"If your in the san fransico area be on high alert. Uber drivers don't go through background check , all they need is a car, license and to be approved by a ""inspector"" to begin picking people up . I take it upon myself to look up the person picking me up & I've used Uber twice already. On my second trip I was to get picked up by a Akeem Davis and when I loomed his up a ton of red flags were popping up. I immediately cancelled and contact Uber yet they have refused to respond to the concerns I've asked them about regarfing these workers. Don't trust Uber drivers.",0
"Thanks so much to Uber, who cancelled my ride, charged me for it, admitted I was wrongfully charged, and yet still kept the money for themselves as an ""Uber credit."" Why not just stick your crooked hands in my wallet? Going into someone's bank account and giving yourself their money without reason is robbery. Cab companies can't do that. Now stop e-mailing me with your desperate pleas for me to reach out to Congress, because obviously thieves don't make for a safe ride home.",0

"Uber use to be great. Remember when you got the first one? It was so easy and convenient. Now, they are worse than taxi's. Surge charging to 2 or 3+ times the normal rate, app crashes, poor drivers, and above all, weak and unhelpful customer service. Now any d bag with a license can be a driver. Some of the drivers even pedal coke and weed thru Uber. Other drivers hit on girls and try to get dates. We had a driver pick us up in his pajamas once. Another driver had a tire blow out and told us there was nothing he could do about it and we basically paid double for the trip since we had to order another uber. This is no longer a company that is in control. Uber use to be great. They use to be the Nordstrom of transportation. Now, you might get the first car you click, or maybe the app will crash. Maybe the driver will wait 10 minutes then call you and cancel the ride because he's stuck in traffic. Once you get the car, cross your fingers for a cool knowledgeable driver but 9 times outta 10 the driver is out of their area and they have no idea where they are. So use gps, but it doesn't help when gps takes you the ""shortest"" and most traffic ridden route. After your trip, hopefully you get charged the correct amount... Or maybe the driver will contact uber and say your trip was longer than it actually was and they will charge you more, which I hear is happening more often now. At least taxi drivers have to work out your transaction on the spot and you know you won't be charged more at a later time. Taxi drivers are also usually driving as a career, supporting their family, barely scraping by. One of my last uber drivers was a real estate agent using uber to give out his friend number to order weed. WTF? Uber USE TO be great. Now, I'd rather just take a taxi. The uber app is convenient, but is it that much harder to dial a cab??",1
"I requested a Uber in Paris and their driver somehow forgot to load my case that had 3 laptops, one new samsung s6 one camera and May brochures that were prepared for my business trip. I found out about it missing at the airport so we had to drive back to our office in Paris and of course it was missing . I missed my flight and so did my partner who I shared the ride with. It cost us over $700 to rebook another flight 2 days later. To make things worst, we were charged 235 euros for the trips and the time it took us to file a police report. I complained to Uber and some lady responded with simple sorry, saying I left my bag on street which of course I did not and it wasn't some public street and I recall very well telling driver to put in tunck and use back seat for larger case. Today and I am in NewYork I missed a call from Paris followed by an email which I responded to both but no answer on phone and still waiting for another call. My total losses are at least $4000 . AfterThis Uber experience I instructed my office not to ever use Uber again anywhere. A simple call or maybe a credit on bill or anything would have suffice. Stop using them.",1

"I will not use Uber again. When we left our concert on July 4, the only available rides were at 5 times the rate. There was no indication in the app window of what our total fare would be and I NEVER would have approved $111 dollars for a twenty minute ride. There needs to be more transparency in how fares are being shown before and during a trip. If you are booking a ride on this service, check the fine print and be sure you find out what the fare will be before you get in the car. Beware of Â¨dynamic pricingÂ¨ or Â¨surge pricing.Â¨ Nuff said, I will call a local cab from now on.",0

"I would give Uber less than one star if I could. I drive for Uber and was shorted time and time again. They short drivers and overcharge passengers.

I was making more than $100 up to $200 per day averaging $17.50 fare each trip and 3.2 stars out if 5 when my logins were rejected as druver account not activated. I had no customer arguements or complaints except for a support email from somebody named Eric who said that based on past ratings Uber no longer will use me as a contractor. The email time stamp looked ficticious as is read 13:45 when it actally was sent at 15:45 or 3:45Pm. At 6:30pm the email completely vanished from my Imap email on both devices i had used. You will run out of data if you dint have an unlimited plan. There was so much construction that the Uber app sent me up to four miles further several times. At the same tume Uber's sever started having SERIOUS issues making their site likely under attack. Will i get my job back? Uber has NO PHONE SUPPORT WHATSOEVER. There us very turse limited message and the email support goes to different desks to someone other than the source of the problem. This on Friday the weekend of summerfest in milwaukee. Life's not always fair but management by big business of local traffic matters is a failed experiment and should go back to communist societies that rob the priductive and hide the resulting windfall profit to the corrupted manager types who only grease the sqeeky wheeks.,0

Then I went onto their LinkedIn page to voice my disdain & they DELETED MY POST!!! If this is how they treat customers, I hope someone brings them down. No one online should get away with hiding behind a website, NO ONE. Especially not a company that draws such attention. What does Uber have to hide???",0

Too many idiots being taken advantage of because, they LET it happen. Always review a company first.

"First of all, this company is a total fraud, they tell their drivers they make 20 an hour which is total lie, you makeless than minimum wage, you have to also factor fuel costs, wear and tear of youof car and a lot of oil changes, bottom line is this company isn't worth the trouble, please don't sign up for Uber, you only be their for few months and then deactivate you and stuck paying car payments and no job. As a passenger it's great until your credit card is abused, take a cab it's safer on you and your credit card",0

I have to say this is going to be my first and last time I ever use this service. I am going to be writing on every site possible about the terrible scam that is UBER cabs! Claim to be the cheapest but on the night out at 2am when we were trying to book it wouldn't let us change the surcharge and anything less than 2.4 wouldn't get accepted. As a customer being my first time with uber and trusting that it should still be cheap I booked. Only to realise I ended up paying Â£102 for a ride which has never been more than Â£40!!!! Biggest biggest scam ever and never ever am I gonna use this service! After complaining that the driver took a bad route I was given an email saying the estimate was rigt??? Maybe uber should check facts! Never has a cab ride from London to Harrow costed me more than 40! Worst company ever!!they claim that they give an estimate of the fare! Don't be fooled no such thing happened! The next thing we know is driver is on his way and once we get home we receive the huge a** receipt! STAY AWAY!,0

I emailed UBER support right away but they are not available during the late night, it seems. I have changed my password and sent another email asking to delete my account but am afraid I will get charged again despite it all. Why is it not possible to take the credit card off the site? I don't want to go through the hassle of cancelling my card when it's just an UBER problem. If the site just offered that option I wouldn't be deleting my account. But now I'm totally turned off UBER and will stop using them asap.",0

"I am a working professional designer and thought I could earn some extra money from Upwork. The clients are generally terrible at communication. Countless people have accepted my proposals, wasted my time with back-and-forth emails, etc. Only to disappear and never be heard from again. In addition to the low quality clientele, the site is over saturated with mediocre, untrained awful freelancers. Upwork is garbage and I will never waste my time with them again.",0
"I joined Upwork two years ago because a friend told me about this place for freelancers and I was looking for a good site to gain experience and earn some money. I immediatly encountered issues where despite my applications, no client was interested because of my lack of experience on the site, thus no profile reviews on my part which didn't make me appear like a trustful user. I gave up for a long time until I started receiving invites to interviews not long ago and I decided to give it another try, so I replied, sent applications... nothing. The most disheartening thing is the very little amount of money clients are willing to offer a freelancer. They want you to deliver a detailed work without paying as much as it's worth and they even ""mock"" you saying you shouldn't expect that much especially if you are new on the platform and with no feedback at hand. This is very disrespectful and not professional at all. Other clients are also very vague about what they want the moment you finally find someone interested, sending you references and telling what they need without actually showing you in detail. This will result in a terrible waste of time and again, for a very little amount of money. As if that weren't enough, Upwork apparently likes hiding your profile if you haven't earned money for a while, or used the platform at all even when you're actually in the middle of a contract. You use the site because you want to create a better portfolio and get the needed feedbacks to work more, but how are you supposed to do so if they hide your account from the clients? They don't really offer you the chance to grow unless you're lucky and the small ones are basically treated like slaves most of the time. You want a job well done, you pay as much as the freelancer deserves, simple as that. If you want a cheap job go looking for royalty free stocks and be happy with it. One thing many people fail to consider is that some of us are from Europe and the currency changes depending on your Country. Living in Italy I already face a considerable loss whenever I convert from USD to Euro and if we count the fees Upwork itself takes from the final price offered by the client, you may end up earning HALF if not less of what they are offering you. If you're considering the platform to begin your freelance career, don't even bother with Upwork, it's a no-go.",0

"The concept of it is a great one, but the service at upwork is the worst.

Then, I've submitted my suggestions to the Upwork support to improve their membership option more than once. With 60 bids/connects per month there's not much you can do. I didn't like the idea of paying $2 per additional bid. Eventually, my account got suspended because I was bidding too many times with no success.

You could work through UpWork for 10 years and contribute tens of thousands of dollars to their profit and they could lay you off forever in a heartbeat based on their policy (after 10 years) or based on a whim of your employer who falsely reports you. If you built your freelance business solely on UpWork platform YOU ARE SCREWED my friend. UpWork is just another example of evil corporatism. The fact that they make money out of connecting workers with employers for hard cash does not make them any different from weapons producers or oil companies. They represent the evil nature of corporatism. They care only about their profit.,0

"Upwork doesn't understand that as a platform that connects freelancers and clients, they have a responsibility by referring freelancers to clients.

"Odesk (old name of Upwork) became lousy after being merged with other freelancers site. You can't get a job easily if you don't have any earnings yet. And if you apply for let's say 10 jobs, they do suspend your account INDEFINITELY for the reason that your application is high. Below is an example of their email after suspending an account: We are contacting you to let you know we have suspended your access to Upwork indefinitely. Our decision is based on a careful review and the fact that you have submitted a high number of proposals for jobs on our site without many contracts or earnings. Unfortunately, this means the jobs posted by clients are not a good match for your skills. I know this news is likely disappointing to you. But our goal at Upwork is to enable freelancers to successfully connect and collaborate with clients who need their skills and expertise.

"I have been on the platform for several years now and at some point I was a paying user. My expertise is in SEO and as you can imagine competition is high and there are a lot of so called ""experts"" that charge low rates and most of them land the jobs. In the first years I was charging also relatively low rates, but as my expertise and experience grew, I increased my rate, but at the same time considerably lowered the chances of getting projects easily. What did upwork do? Probably after applying to 20-25 jobs in about 2 months, I get an email saying that my account has been removed because I had no contracts gained and that my skills are not required by their clients. No warning, no nothing (while 7 jobs where still active and I had proposals sent and waiting for replies). Anyway - I will be looking into other platforms that are not flooded by low quality freelancers that don't care about quality of work and can afford to charge lower rates since they don't care about making a business connection with their clients.",0
"I was a successful freelancer with Elance, which in 2013 was the best freelancing platform on the web. For six months I actually made a full time living as a writer/editor and supported a family of five after losing my day job. It was my water of life. Then someone got the bright idea to merge with ODesk, the ultimate dirtbag third-world lowball platform where I had never found any jobs that paid even close to US market value. If you mix water and dirt you get mud. Quality writing jobs disappeared and in the four+ years since the merger I have not seen one job worth bidding on. ODesk successfully poisoned and absorbed its more successful competitor.",0
"I have used Elance before it became Upwork and the quality of providers was much higher . These days as long as someone can pass the basic ready test he is good to go and based on Upwork policys allowed to screw you out of time and money. If you and your contractor agree on terms Upwork does not care and allows them to bill you what they want. So if someone enters hrs you are stuck paying for services which where not delivered. Will be looking for a new platform to hire programming contractors as Upwork is becoming shady. They bill you Monday am, and before you can dispute something they deduct the $$ from your account. Legit companys give you a few days to review and you pay for undisputed amounts. But hey customer service is as bad as the platform itself as it is down multiple times a week",0
Avoid Upwork at all costs when you require a software project. My experience is that Upwork will protect scammers and allow them to keep on working after taking your money. Software projects require time to iron out all the bugs and the Upwork platform will not allow you to modify reviews when freelancers do not complete their work but keep your money.,1
"I used Upwork for the first and it was the last time. Their freelancer delivered not functional website, I asked for a full refund, they said I need to ask freelancer. When I contact him for refund, he blocked me. I contacted Upwork again, sent them all necessary information about the work I was promised and what I recived, all messages...and after several emails they said that they just connect freelancers and clients and they cant do anything about my case. I lost my money and received very very poor website.",1
Dont waste your time on upwork. they will not provide good support and charing to much and suspended active profile without any reason.,0
"Upwork has a credit card verification process that is extremely burdensome for businesses. The customer and the freelancer have to spend numerous hours and a ridiculous amount of time verifying a couple hundred dollar credit card payment. Meanwhile, the freelancer has done the work and Upwork will not process process payment and pay the freelancer. Upwork has turned a great experience with my freelancer into a payment time-sink where I will no longer use the service. Too bad!",0
"Got linked up with a freelancer and it was going well until I realized there was no way this person could accomplish the task, and then you are just screwed. The freelancer was making 8th grade graphics, literally thought it was a joke when it first was submitted. I would never use this site again because of the process, you should get a trial period to see if the person can actually do what you are looking for. Do not ever use this site, and if you do then know how much risk you are taking. I'm sure there are good freelancers on there but few and far between, good luck hunting.",1
"I posted a job on Upwork for white-hat, quality link building. I got a response from a freelancer promising the following: ""I will carry out an extensive research based on industry vertical and first prepare a list of related blogs, bloggers, influencers and website owners and start with an outreach campaign to gain valuable link placement on authority sites. Backlinks will be on highly relevant and authority sites and will be permanent and contextual links. Recently, I've had a very good success rate building in-content links on already published articles on authority sites."" He ended up placing 4 links on sites that had the lowest quality writing. 1 was de-indexed in google indicating it had already been penalized for spamming; 1 used to be a French e-commerce site that went out of business, and the domain was bought for history/DA and turned into a blog to sell links (domain name was complete irrelevant to the niche); 3 had all traffic coming from referral and direct traffic, indicating a PBN. I asked him to remove the links. He never did. I ended up having to disavow the links. What made matters worse, is when I contact Upwork and asked if I could leave feedback so other businesses would have a warning, they told me feedback was only allowed when payment was made on a project, but that it would count towards the freelancers job completion rate. I checked the freelancers job completion rate, at it was at 53%. Obviously, if someone misrepresents their skills, there will be a dispute. And, given his completion rate, this likely wasn't the first time. He is still operating nonetheless. This policy facilitates bad behavior by freelancers, and is a shady business practice by Upwork.",1
Read the bad reviews and you'll know everything you need to know about UpWork. This form requires me to type a minimum of 100 characters. So I'll repeat: Read the bad reviews and you'll know everything you need to know about UpWork.,0
"I recently signed up at Upwork and had my first project which took me about 1 day of work. All seemed to be perfectly normal. I completed the project the client approved payment and then suddenly my account was blocked. After reaching out to the Customer Service, they informed me that I had to verify several details. Which I did, then they asked if I could reach out to my client as there was a problem they could not explain. I reached out to the client and didnt get an answer. Then I mailed Upwork during a period of 2 months several times, I hardly got any response, sometimes it took over a week to get a respond from Upwork. Today I received the message (see screenshot attached) that because my client was fraudulent they won't be paying me for my completed work. It has been a terrible experience working with this company. There CS is rude, unprofessional takes ages to respond and the worst: they won't pay me for my completed work. I strongly advice to not work with Upwork if you don't want to lose your money. This company is a mess!",1
"i dont know what they think bout themsleves , i took 5 motnths to become toprated and then suddenly during varification all submitted doc file they r rejecting and they suspend my profile . and aksing me u infuture u cant open any new acc..wtf! do u think we a dealing drugs over ther? get a life .. racist site..",0
"If you want put your money in the sea, please go to upwork. They are stealers who stole my money. I hired a freelancer who didnt complete the work but upwork has released my deposit which was in the upwork escrow without my consent.",1
"Upwork is a waste of money and time. I hired a copy editor, who actually left out a sentence in the first paragraph of my book. I next hired a proofreader who was so bad I made her give me my money back. If you want either, find someone through word of mouth.",1
"With good intentions I was looking for work writing, editing and reviewing for media sites. Here is an example of some of the work offered on UpWork. First employer: I need a 40 page e-book written in 2 weeks for $50. Second employer: For my blogsite I need 2-4 blogs per month (1,000 words each) to be paid at the rate of $10 each. Must have a minimum of a masters degree. Third employer: Need a tutor for my bratty kid to train in the sciences. Will pay $5 per session. These a facetious representation yet they come close to the mark to the job offerings on UpWork. This company keeps a minimum of 20% of the wage. My advice: Upwork is a disaster paying slave wage with potential employers who are either nutcases or live under a rock. Many better sites stay light years away from this one.",0
"A complete waste of time. I should have trusted the poor reviews before signing up. Their platform is totally archaic at best. They boast over 50K jobs available, but the majority are scams or low-brow offers. Hardly worth the time and energy. The gig descriptions are often vague, and the ""client"" rarely if never follows up with you, in a timely manner [2-3 days]. And most of them only open a new browser page that requests your Credentials---basically what you already have on your profile [including your resume] So really, you're just repeating yourself. Sorry - but no freelancer has the time or patience to roll with this nonsense.",0
"I have been a freelancer for a very short time with UPWORK and no where are you able to reach out for assistance as a ""Freelancer"" to make sure you get paid. I have recently been engaged with two doctors from Washington to solicit and create a sponsorship package for their event in Martha's Vineyard, a ""Mindfulness Retreat"", Aeva Doomes. I was not paid and they ended contract. They were very hard to work with and very rude, sending threatening emails on time frames, etc. Upwork answered no outreach to assist.",0
"Third class freelancing service provider, this is for only few peoples, not for all. They don't want allow you to make profile on there platform. Everything is rubbish. :/",0
"They blocked files from being downloaded from my freelancer, then totally failed in their attempt to make them available, causing me to miss my deadline. They hide the support chat between time wasting worthless FAQs and a labyrinth of crap. They detracted from the interaction and got paid for it.",0
Want to give minus points to upwork..tried everything..but they have created a mindset they they won't allow the new creative people to enter on upwork site ..and thats really shamful ...they are no one to say the freelancers that we are somewhere less from other freelancers working on upwork. You haven't even checked yet so how come u can justify anyone form by simply seeing the skills.,0
"After spending an hour going through the account set-up, I was told I wasn't approved for some vague reasoning. I am more than qualified in multiple areas, so don't waste your time.",0
"This website is overrated. I think soon it will be bankrupted, because they think only to earn more money. They have $#*!ty support, illogical answers, unexpected account suspensions, I know a lot of people even couldn't register. So end is coming for them F*ck UpWork and all its employees!!",0
My account was suspended by giving the following excerpted message: We are contacting you to let you know we have suspended your access to Upwork indefinitely. Our decision is based on a careful review and the fact that you have submitted a high number of proposals for jobs on our site without many contracts or earnings. --- Do you see any reason? They have limited number of proposal credits but also it was not allowed. I had received two 5 star ratings on the job and was still trying to do the best.,0
"First, they take 20% of your earnings. If you also file your earnings when doing your taxes, remember it's another 30% (in Canada). So essentially working on UpWork you are making half of whatever your rate is. (20+30 = 50% lost) Second, I had a client hire me, start a contract, then go immediately unresponsive. After months of trying to engage them, I decided to end the contract. However, since I ended the contract as a freelancer, UpWork decided to penalize my profile and drop my profile success score by 75% even though it was not my fault that the client decided to fall off the face of the earth. After contacting UpWork, I just got one templated reply after the other.",0
"I am a semi-retired professional who came to the Upwork site with the best of intentions. So far, I have exhausted my 'connects' within the first two weeks, and yes, I did end up working for one client (more on that later). Other than that, no potential client ever got back to me. Similar to social media, with its incessant 'you have a message' format, Upwork updates continuously, so it SEEMS to be in a freelancer's best interest to constantly monitor the site. Well, bottom line, two almost wasted weeks. The one client is proving to be very difficult (does not get back to me, rarely answers messages) and NO other responses from anyone. The point about the client is that even though she is a legitimate person who does need something produced, even if you do manage to get hooked up through this website, it is not just 'do your job and you will be fine.' Like many endeavors, once you do land a job, your trouble really starts then. But that's life, that's business, dealing with customers. The problem is that Upwork truly makes it not worth even going out and finding the customers. Right now it is Saturday morning, I am giving about five potential jobs until Monday to get back to me, and then I am closing the account. What Upwork did positive was that it made me very happy to hear from my old full time employer who wants me to come back on a per-diem basis. Maybe I just needed to see what else was out there. Thanks to Upwork, I told them I would come back, I start Monday.",0
"I had a profile with 150 projects completed positively and 500 hours during five years of hard work, but hard! They closed my account because I had a double profile years ago, without personal information, because I forgot my password, without wanting to write the email one morning with my eyes closed, and, in a few hours later the profile closed one by all, without availability to enter the web and register again! The person who understood me, knew only one thing, you do not have more accounts here, as if I were a delinquent with two balls !!!",0
This site is racist!! I Wasted my time trying to apply as a freelance writer for more than two weeks. They will always have a reason to reject your application without even giving you an opportunity.,0
"Upwork hires criminals. I discovered this when I found that one of their freelancers has 3 convictions of violent crimes. UpWork responded that they do not discriminate and what a freelancer does with their personal time is not their business. However, some freelancers meet face-to-face and could be using Upwork to cause harm or commit more crimes. UpWork has no idea if any of the freelancers they ""connect"" with others are violent offenders, predators, sex offenders, pedophiles, etc. because they feel they have no duty to let you know this information. I would never recommend them.",1
bull $#*! site i ended up getting ripped off for almost a thousand bucks :/ watch out poor quality work and no one is on your side ever.,1
This site claims to have a very secure environment and also prides itself on Trust and Safety. Do not be fooled!!! The site has no trust or safety or even protects your privacy or personal information. Don't hire via this website as it's a con.,0
"I have almost 8 years of experience in IT and I created a profile on upwork. I was charging comparatively less as I was new to the freelancing business. After few proposals, the upwork has suspended my account forever stating that the skillset do not match. I have been working with various multinational companies and do not see a point here. The customer service is too bad.",0
"This an awful site. Professional get paid very little money. On top of that, may unqualified ""professionals"" do the job you are qualified to do. Also, clients know that they can get away with paying very little money to real professionals. Translations for 1 cent per word, language classes for 2 dollars, etc. I call that a scam. Also, the people of Upwork, if you don't get clients they ""hide"" your profile, so, they will punish you if you don't sell your services at the lowest price. Go and work in your local cafÃ©, probably where you will earn more.",0
"(There's a Suggestion for Upwork at the end) To Survive at Upwork, you need to be a Salesman, which is a Requirement by Upwork, not by the Client. As Once if you get hired, Client has Nothing to Do with you Selling Skill. If you are not a Good Salesman, doesn't matter how experienced you are, you will get SUSPENDED! Simply! I have Seen Hundred's of Suspended Experienced (Field Expert) people from upwork,in fact its an Hot Topic on Google. (just query something like ""upwork account suspended"") Client Requires Field Experts, Upwork Delivers them Salesman. This is how Upwork is NOT CONNECTING the Right Candidate! SUGGESTION FOR UPWORK: If someone is Not getting Hired, it doesn't mean he/she is not field Expert, it depicts he/she is Good At Selling! Upwork can easily Improve its Algorithm by Including the ""Test Results"" (Conducted by Upwork) to Determine the Experienced Professional. Define a Threshold, below that Threshold may get suspended (if there are not earning enough)!",0
It took me more than 1h! to find how to contact their customer support on their website! It's really hidden and confusing. It looks like they really don't want anyone to contact them. When I finally wrote them I got an auto reply. Few more e-mails and quite generic replies followed... I don't even know if it was a real person who answered. They didn't accept my profile on their platform never got a clear answer why and what shall be improved. At the end now quite happily working via their competitor's platform.,0
"Poor process in general, demands a lot of unnecessary private information that they don't really look at other than just saying I have a record of you in our system. Don't use ever if you are hoping to keep any kind of privacy. Also 0 support service that responds slow and just overall unsupportive if your salary is on the lower end (I've heard if you are spending/earning more on upworks they will tune in faster, which is understandable yet disturbing).",0
"This site could be good, but the majority of the jobs are junk and the amount of money they charge is way too much for the service they provide. Most jobs that are not, do my homework are people looking for someone in third world countries that will do their job for them. I have had some nice low paying jobs editing and proofing for non-native English speakers. So I proof someone's blog for 10 dollars and receive 8 dollars. Not so great. 100 becomes 80 and so on. Most of my freelance work now comes from word of mouth, Craigslist and other places. Then I get a notice my account will be suspended if I am not more active on their site? Doesn't freelance mean you work when you want? I did not sign any contract with them.",0
"They've really gone downhill since the merger a couple of years ago. I had a great experience with Elance and then saw that Upwork was nothing but a garbage site with $5 jobs, so I didn't transfer my profile. Then they add insult to injury by upping the fee to freelancers to 20%, on a sliding scale: the more money you make with a single client, the smaller the percentage they take but you have to hit something like $1000 before you get a break. Since most jobs are one-off and under $100, they are killing their freelancers profit margins. Greed like I've never seen. They also are having problems with hackers. They get into the site easily posing as clients and employers. NO FILTER system to keep them out. UpWork relies on the freelancers to spot the scammers. Disgusting. If it's any comfort, the site is in real, not imagined, decline, per Alexa's website ranking system. See their graph attached.",0
"I've had a freelancer Upwork for a while now, and I've only recently begun to apply again. I had just gotten my first job and finished it successfully when I got an email notifying me that my account is suspended. Apparently, Upwork thinks that the reason you don't get jobs is because your skills aren't right. This assumption is pretty infuriating by itself, given that there's so much competition and many of the clients end up not picking anyone. Plus, why would you offer so many connects + the option to buy more if you don't want us to use them? ""Our decision is based on a careful review and the fact that you have submitted a high number of proposals for jobs on our site without many contracts or earnings. Unfortunately, this means the jobs posted by clients are not a good match for your skills."" This is one big sad joke. Ignoring the fact that they take more than 20% of the money, why wouldn't they give freelancers a chance to build up a client base? Why did they suspend my account only after I got my first job? I wrote to them, sent out diplomas and certificates, they wrote back that their decision is final, ignoring my arguments alltogether. In over 5 years of professional experience I've never had one negative feedback, everybody was always very pleased with my work (including the one Upwork client), and they dare to tell me my skills aren't fit for the clients? Outrageous. STAY AWAY! Exploitative and unfair system!",0
"I had hired a freelancer through upwork to design retail packaging for my product. I followed all the steps required through upwork, including a well-written contract with all the specifics. I paid the first payment in advance as I was asked by the freelancer. The freelancer failed to communicate after that and extracted the second payment out of escrow. When I lodged a complaint about it, I kept getting poor responses focused on giving me excuses on why and how they cannot get a hold of the freelancer and long cumbersome details on what an 'escrow' means etc. My point was that I essentially paid for a a product that I did not receive and the entire point of going through a company such as Upwork is that in such cases they can be the mediator. After a few weeks of writing long emails, I gave up. I kept being passed from one person to another and eventually was spending more in time dealing with the inefficient customer service at upwork rather than my business. It may be a good portal to find cheap skills but it is a high risk model due to its poor management. I would suggest to try one of the other websites, with better customer service.",1
"Upwork allows freelancers to bill you without delivering work and OBLIGATES you to pay them. It is not fair that there is no protection. I hired an app developer for my startup, and he took my money and delivered nothing. So I have no app and loss of funds. On top of that when fraud occurs all they do is cancel the job and do not offer you a refund for service that was paid with no delivery because they continuously state that their platform ONLY serves as a place for you to hire and process payment. Once funds are released, they have NO MEANS TO GO AFTER YOUR LOSS. As a client, they will only refund you the 10% in fees that you paid but what about the charges that the platform incurred from the fraudulent freelancer which is 30%. They do not even bother to refund you that 30% fee because by not addressing the Fraud they are monetizing from it. They advertise payment protection and top quality freelancers by showing their high job success, and the income earned based on the completed work, so you trust that this person is legit and knowledgeable. I would never think that they would take my money due the qualities that they portray on the platform. For a long-term project, I did not suspect anything until I realized that more than 50% of the payment was coming out and the delivery of the work kept delaying. Upwork sent me a message stating that this freelancer was committing fraud and ended our contract. Upwork accidentally cc'd me on another clients email that encountered the same problem as I, and they too were creating an app. Coincidence? I think not. I started noticing that the trends of the scammed clients were working on big long-term projects. Upwork needs to be investigated! I am looking for a lawyer that is willing to take on a case like this.",1
"Actually i don't like share my issue to others, but this exception since it can ruin someone life and i hope i can protect other clients from Upwrok. I used Upwork and lost $1150 + arbitrary cost $300 so total i lost by abuse and fraud of Upwork is $1450 and waste 3 months time. It started when I post a job with detail description by Fixed Price you can see the job desc on this link https://fileholic.com/share/Upwork-job-desc.png As you see it show $1000 at the beginning but after Frelancer ask more, we agreed on $1150, with bold point it need work on Framework React/Angular for frontend. Upwork has a great support during the progress and i don't have any bad impression about them. Upwork also recommend a Freelancer to me (he is High Rate Freelancer with Good Reputation) and after Freelancer agreed, he start work on it and i already paid to Upwork $1150. 2 weeks later, He show me the sample via link to see the admin page and front page style, but he not work on it via Framework for frontend like we agreed before, so i ask he to not waste time anymore and do like we agreed with framework Frontend via React. After 3 months later, he promised that he will deliver the same design frontend and admin like file that i already send to him 2 months before, but after i wait 2 months he show link the same page and same admin page like when he show on the first time without React. So i felt i just fraud by this Freelancer, he not do any progress since 2 months ago, he just smart to explain but no work at all, also the fact that he never send any files to me that make me decide to stop waste my time with this Freelancer and plan to try find other freelancer that far better rather this one. So i ask to Upwork how can i end of this with this Freelancer, and i already explain my issue to Upwork, and they said ""according to TOS etc"" i must click cancel from job page, and it can't done without confirm from Freelancer side, i really surprise with this funny rule, if Freelancer already send the files or do the work close with the requirement that will make more sense that Freelancer has rights to confirm my dispute, but this one, he never send me any files and never do the work closely with my requirements. So Upwork not give me any choice to waiting confirmation from Freelancer, and like i thought 100% is correct that freelancer refuse to it and demand payment 50% from agreement, and it shocked me that this Freelancer use his chance to against my dispute and demand payment for nothing. I reject it and explain i offer this job as Fixed Price mean i only able to pay that i want based on my description. Do you want pay something that you already describe but you get nothing or see the item is not closely with you want ? So i ask Upwork as middle man / protection as side who held my money from fraud Freelancer like him, and again i shocked that Upwork state they not able to as middle man and there is other party that able to make decision on each issue on Upwork platform, and that party is not even you aware, that party is Arbitrary. When you have issue with bad Freelancer and want to help to solve your issue, you must pay $300 more for fee Arbitrary, again, i felt Upwork abuse and fraud me since they only want my money but dont want take any responsibility if there is bad Freelancer or bad Client on they Platform. So I pay Arbitrary and finally Arbitrary decide to pay Freelancer 100% , shocked by this Arbitrary decison, and i want to ask to Arbitrary what is the reason i must pay 100% to Freelancer and they have rule to not have to explain everything to anyone. So here i am, Fraud and Abuse on the first time with famous platform Freelancer like Upwork, before this i never get this experience with other Freelancer marketplace because other is responsible and they will do action directly for Bad Freelancer and Bad Client so as long you stay good and clear, you will be safe, but not on Upwork. I want make a point or advice from my experienced and you must knew this before you use Upwork: 1) Upwork not responsible with your money as client, from any issue you experience from job or from any Freelancer. They only want your money, once you pay to Upwork, you no longer has rights and Upwork doesn't care if you get fraud by Freelancer. 2) Upwork will not give you any support/help and he will throw your issue to other party that completely outside of between you and Upwork, and remember, Arbitrary fee is $300 upfront. This Arbitrary also doesn't care with your money and you must explain all things from beginning to them, and they can make any decision they like, and they don't have responsibility with their decisions (It's like dreaming job when you can do anything and you don't need do responsible with your action ). 3) Upwork Community and Support is not a support, it build from them to build image they have great platform and support (which they are not), you will not get any help or proper support like on other Platform Freelancer Marketplace. 4) Rather you risk your precious money to Upwork, you better use on other Platform that want to take responsibility as middle man between Client and Freelancer and will not lap their hands to other party plus you not need to pay more for other party like Upwork. While this is the rights of Upwork to lap their hands from any issue inside their platform, we as client especially need careful with their TOS, better you use other like F*verr or other like Freelancer.com This Upwork or former is Elance (probably one of the reason they change brand is to avoid bad testimonial and try to rebrand new to give customers better company but, they really worse) No files, no work you get and you lost $1450, that happen on Upwork for real. After Freelancer win, he contact me by skype for laugh and mock me and it just give my day more worse. Be Careful Guys. Last One: For Proof that i'm not boast, here is the more proof that you might interest to check https://fileholic.com/share/Decision-Arbitrary.png (this the proof Arbitrary that win the Freelancer) https://fileholic.com/share/Upwork-denied-responsible.png (this the One of the proof Upwork don't want responsible with your case even it happen on their platform) Probably after this some Upwork team will try to defend their rights by TOS and blame that Arbitrary decision is final decision that everyone should accept, even the fact freelancer do fraud is the winner. Also If you a Freelancer you can get free money like this Freelancer by abuse TOS Upwork, like you just need show link to your client that which seems to show you are already working, no need send any files, you can also can use any link you found from google, and make your client upset, and once your client dispute, challenge him, and prepare win on Arbitrary level for free money (some good Freelancer will not do this, but this method will use by bad freelancer person, and on the end, Client must pay that when they got trap) I hope i already give you a point and warn you before you got ""trap"" on Upwork. Seriously, use other freelancer marketplace, there are a lot alternative out there.",1
I joined when this was elance- it was awesome and about when it turned into upwork it started to stink....the quality of the freelancers went down and the customer service and interface took a turn for the worse. I wish there was a better alternative b/c this company has high fees and very bad unfair customer service. They think customer service means blame the customer.... Others on here say the same thing about the platform. They really need to get their customer service together and treat their users like customers.,0
"People on this platform did not evolve with the rest of us normal people. That is all i have to say because i don't want to start a debate on what one person has said then what the other one has said... It is just a useless website with fake job offer posted automatically and if you actually get a job you will get payed almost nothing after taxes, fees and withdrawal fees that NOT EVEN PAYPAL charges anymore!",0
"This platform is horrible and a waste of time. I have worked there for a year, completed successfully about 10 projects and my clients gave me excellent feedback. However, way too many reports of suspended profiles with no reason and too little money left for you after you pay something like 30% in fees and taxes. What's more, should you have a problem, no one will give a s*** about it. Their support is the worst CS I have ever communicated with. Why do we pay 20% fee? Stopped using it in November.",0
"I have worked with UpWork as a freelancer since it was ODesk and have completed multiple jobs off and on over the years. Since the merger, in 2015, I believe, they now take a larger percent of the freelancer's pay, which I feel is unfair and a lot more than it should be. But, fine. The site needs to make money. However, today, out of the blue, I receive this below message that my account has been suspended: ""Im writing to let you know that your profile appeared to contain misleading information about your skills and/or experience, so it was flagged for review. I have carefully reviewed all aspects of your account and concluded you are in violation of the Upwork Terms of Service (for more details, please see the Upwork User Agreement, Section 3.2).

Please note that it is unlikely that we will respond to any future correspondence regarding this matter"" Now, reading other reviews, I realize that they have actually improved their pathetic and frankly, offensive Customer Care Service message. At least they are stating the policy, of which, I have listed here: 3.2 Account Registration; Profile By registering for an account, you must complete a User profile (Profile), which you consent to be shown to other Users and, unless you change your privacy settings, the public. If you are a Freelancer, unless you use the Site solely as an employee and Agency Member of a registered Agency Account, you represent and warrant that you use your Profile to market your business to others for the purpose of entering into independent contractor relationships with other Users. You agree to provide true, accurate, and complete information on your Profile and all registration and other forms you access on the Site or provide to us and to update your information to maintain its truthfulness, accuracy, and completeness. You agree not to provide and to correct any information about your location, your business, your skills, or the services your business provides that is or becomes false or misleading. You agree not to register for more than one Client Account and one Freelancer Account without express written permission from us (except that you may register as an Agency Member of other Accounts as provided below). You agree not to ask or allow another person to create an Account on your behalf, for your use, or for your benefit. However, it my case, this ""violation"" is completely unfounded. There is nothing inaccurate about my profile. In a response that I suspect will also go unanswered, I suggested that UpWork revise their email response and consider providing an option for appeal. Stating that their random and completely unfounded decision is final, cannot be reversed and that they are unlikely to respond to any correspondence leads me to believe that UpWork does not value the basic foundation in which this nation was founded (think 14th amendment). To not even engage in proper correspondence to try and resolve the conflict to re-instate the suspension is a first class act of bad business. I will not be requiring their services in the future.",0
"Upwork rejected my application. I have superior writing capabilities and access to online databases like EBSCO Host. I could have brought excellent writing and content creation skills to the platform yet they rejected my application because they have too many writers. How is that possible? Why not let employers decide? I suspect they rejected me because I have started my own SaaS for business development, not at all in competition to Upwork. I guess I should have lied and showed myself to be less capable of delivering quallity writing and online content.",0
"I was trying to register as a free lancer after there site being down for hours threw out the days and figured it was safe. After doing everything I get ""Planned Maintenance In Progress"". Maybe they should hire a better tech for there servers since they are always offline.",0
This site is a rip off! I cancel a milestone - thanks to a freelancer who did not read the job description. Upwork took a 10% fee off the total sum saying they had to process it. What an absolute joke of a site!,1
"Oh well, this is the second time I have been suspended as a client from upwork. Back in 2015 I signed up to do some freelancing, and then to hire some freelancer too. They suspended my account, saying that I have falsified some info. Upon asking what info has been falsified, to this date there has been no reply. So I sign up another account from my business profile. And after completion of 10-15 hires, which I paid out in full, they still suspend me. What irks is not that they feel something is amiss. That's fine. Gather info and rectify. But what irks is the way they pull the plug. Here is an example: ""I have reviewed all aspects of your account, and unfortunately, you are violating Upwork policies. I regret to inform you that based on that review, it has been determined that your account will not be restored. The policy violation(s) in question lead to this final decision. Please be advised that we may not respond to further requests regarding this issue. Thank you for your understanding."" The most pathetic of Customer Care Service would find this message repugnant and pompous. -Does not mention which policy was violated -Without any communication whatsoever, this is a final termination (not to be restored) -Informs the client that they will not respond to any request on this issue -And if that wasnt sufficient birdie in the face, it says thank you for understanding. People at upwork, understand that you make money from the clients as well as the freelancers. You people live off us, and you do not show a shred of respect. The above message is from 2 days back. The correspondence I had 2 years back was similar. The LEAST you can do in such cases is have a proper correspondence to try and resolve the conflict to re-instate the suspension. Absolutely putrid! but hey, Thank you for understanding!",0
"I just used Upwork for 2 weeks. I have hired 3 people on there and they were good at their work. But Upwork suspended the freelancer's account and my account. They didn't give any clear explanation about their action. I connected with their 5 support agents and all of them just said ""WAIT, WAIT, WAIT"". I couldn't get their response for over a week. I have asked the help from their FB page and they blocked me out in there as well. Just lost $500. Scam website did their job well! Stay away from it.",0
"I understand it's a business and it needs to make money but I think the fees are too high for the majority of work that happens. For each freelancer, they take 20% for the first $500, then 10% up to $10,000 and then 5% after that. It doesn't seem fair at all and probably isn't worth doing little projects on. (Being cynical, I'm sure Upwork knew this would be the case and that's exactly why they made it so unbalanced) I was on it for 2 years, had about 100 jobs, and spent over 10K and, except for only a few cases, most of the freelancers would have only gotten 80% of what I would have paid. In actuality, some of those jobs were probably lower than minimum wage. I'd rather do things on a platform that respects both clients and freelancers. Also, for freelancers, be aware you will have an insane amount of competition. Unless you can do something which is very particular and a specialized skillset, be expecting to be severely underbid by people willing to do extremely low rates. (Less than $5/hr. Seriously)",0
They charge too much and they have crappy services. Their website is always down and they are over charging freelancers for their crappy services. One example is today. I have been a freelancer for about 3 years now and upwork took out my payment method and I had to re enter it. So now I can't pay my bills because I have to wait 3 days for my payment method to be confirmed AGAIN and also their support is of no help. Upwork is ripping off freelancers. All they care about is taking money from freelancers hard work.,0
"I've been a member of this site (and a few other freelancer sites for years). Recently I went to site again as I didn't get many (ANY) sales to see what's new. I was now required to upload a real photo as part of their new requirements. My previous photo was just of a certificate, now I uploaded my real photo ... I'm African American (black). Despite being an approved member before (without seeing my photo), they reviewed my profile and sent me an email in about 30 min stating it was not approved because ""they had enough persons with the skills I offered"". I decided to close that account completely and setup a new account with a different email address to add more of my qualifications. Added my same real photo and again in about 30 min got rejected for the same reason. Wanting to prove a point to myself, I ONCE AGAIN created a 3rd profile. I listed the exact same skills and certifications as the last account. This time I only changed my name and used a Caucasian (white) individual's photo. Took more than 30 min but the very next morning, the profile was approved!! They have rejected a profile twice because of SKIN COLOR !! I understand the need for real photos on some of these site, however if your site & management are RACIST then you are clearly in the wrong business!! IT'S A SHAME THAT IN 2017 THERE IS STILL SO MUCH RACISM GOING ON. AVOID THESE PEOPLE !!!",0
"I am truly disappointed that my application did not go through. Not because I did not qualify, but because the website/company was not transparent enough from the beginning to make it clear that there was a possibility of not being accepted as a member. I thought that the submission was a checking process to see if we were real candidates. I dont appreciate having to give my private information and picture to a company that had these conditions. It would have been more honest on their part to have screened the career quota from the beginning. I feel that the Upwork site is just phishing for data because even if I close my account, they will still have my data. This is very disconcerting.",0
"I opened an account, uploaded an image of my state-issued driver's license and provided my tax information. A few days later, I received an email that my account was approved. However, when I tried to submit a proposal, I was given an error that my US location could not be verified. There was nothing I could do. I could not call anyone. I sent an email to support. Support would provide false & contradictory statements, one after another. The issue was NEVER resolved. It appears they may be a bankruptcy waiting to happen. TOTAL MORONS work in their Support group.",0
This is a scam sites. Fake reviews and fake companies. Fake reviews and fake companies.Fake reviews and fake companies.fake reviews and fake companies.Fake reviews and fake companies.,0
No! got a statement to make about Upwork. It's a $#*!ty company with no regards to Freelancer's views. All they want is money. No loyalty and no heart,0
"Since 2008 I have been an active member (as both a client and a freelancer) of Elance and then Upwork (when my account was moved over) As a client, I have continued to hire freelancers over that period, the most recent being in August this year. I have received 5 star reviews on all of the projects I have been involved with As a freelancer, I have chosen not to work for since my account was moved to upwork, but on Elance I performed many projects. Of those employers who left reviews all were very positive and almost all were 5 stars - but the work history has now mysteriously disappeared from upwork despite being there yesterday A few days ago I decided I would try working as a freelancer again. I applied for several projects in a day. Hours later my account was suspended without explanation. After banging my head against the wall with support I was eventually told that I was not qualified to be applying for these jobs because the number of jobs that I was applying for was too great given my work history - exactly how this is related to my qualifications for the job I have no idea! When I appealed I was then asked to provide evidence of my qualifications. I sent them evidence of my three applicable degrees which were received from top ranked universities in Australia. Shortly after I was simply sent an email stating that the review had been completed and my account was permenantly closed! I have an established work history with freelancers - my CLIENT account is also suspended - and now I am unable to engage them again? The ENTIRE purpose of upwork is to provide a fair and safe marketplace. After a business starts hiring people on upwork they are counting on them to maiintain that fairness. Our company has invested in developing relationships and a shared body of knowledge with our freelancers. Suddenly, and only because I decided to start applying for jobs on a single day, I find myself permenantly banned? How?? After repeatedly asking them to refer me to the section of their terms and conditions which I have supposedly violated, I have received no response. Upwork seems to have a grossly warped sense of what it means to have commercial integrity.. VERY disappointed.",0
A Freelancer threatened to hack me after I left a 2 star review to match their horrible service and attitude. I reported this to Upwork with a screenshot of the conversation and they did nothing and their account says 100% success rating. Do not trust their ratings!,1
"contact support. All they did was reactivate the same system. So i asked them to do it manually instead. They responded saying THEY couldnt verify it either and need more docs. I looked at the doc list and the first thing listed was MY ID! The same one no one can verify, even though it says OREGON across the top and has my name on it. Ive emailed back saying that im not moving forward to find addtl doc till they can assure me that my id wont be a problem. If i had another form of id, i wouldve used it. For an easy app, this sure is complicated.",0
"After deciding to work as a Full-Time freelancer, upwork suddenly decided to suspend my account without any warning or reason. Horrible! I will never use this site again.",0
"I have used Upwork for years and was very happy until about 1 year ago. An example, after having a job posted 1 week, I upgraded the posting for $29.00. This would get me ""great talent"", personal up work counselor to help in the search. Not only did I see the exact same candidates that I had on the free, the counselor was a joke... ""Do you want me to resubmit your posting""? ""Ummm, no I think I can do that myself"". After 2 days and no hires I asked for a refund, asking them to compare my paid vs free (the same), they declined. Talent has gone way down as well because they charge freelancers so much!",0
"Upwork is ruining their own brand. Experienced, skilled freelancers are giving up on Upwork, it is an inferior freelancing platform and the company is very difficult to work. It has turned into a sweatshop, low wage joke!! Example: Hiring clients looking for the most experienced freelancers from US and paying them an average of $6.72 an hour. Most people would conclude that Upwork is the worst freelancing platform. They are driving their reputation and brand down the drain. For serious professional freelancers it is a negative to be associated with Upwork. Freelancers and serious hiring clients - go elsewhere. Don't waste your time.",0
"Where do I begin? Customer service? NOT! Transparent? NOT! OK, the good stuff. I have never had a client who did not pay. Gotta know this, almost all my freelance clients came from Elance. My five ThrowUpWork clients have been very good to pay. The major problem-the so-called Job Success Score. This is life's greatest mystery. For some reason my score dropped below 77. Invites are pretty much non-existent now. ThrowUpWork reassures us that scores above 75 are good. Oh? Every job proposal has the little button activated, the one for a score of 90 or better. They obviously have a lack of mathematics knowledge because 90 is NOT 75. I raised the issue on the message board. The response from ThrowUpWork? 'Life's not fair!' Seriously. But there is a remedy. An email said if I upgrade to a higher-level account my status will change. Not a surprise! First, ThrowUpWork takes 20% of what I earned and now there is an attempt to squeeze more. I apologize for giving one star but as we all know there is no negative-star feature. FedUpWork",0
their policies to eat the commission of freelancer is gruesome. they try to grab the hard-earned money o freelancer in very brutal way,0
"I'm a freelance artist for a living and if I could give upwork -5 stars I would. Before I even get to my main issue they take an unreasonable cut of your earnings and will not let you withdraw your earned money without jumping through many hoops. The first and only project I've taken on that I site I was never paid, despite the fact I submitted the project on time and beyond the requirements. Upwork told me they could offer no support in helping me get paid for my hours of work. Since then the employer has said that he never got my work and therefore wants his money back (which I never received). So now I am being asked to pay for the huge displeasure of having to work for that man. Upwork has had ""technical errors"" and didn't process my first two disputes on that claim. And I am not allowed to contact them to ask for support (as explicitly stated in their email). A horrible site that offers artists below minimum wage with no support when things go pear shape. The point of using a third party is to be protected from matters like this.",0
I'd like to give an absolute minimum feedback. Really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really Bad Site.,0
He owe me with 52 hours of work done on Upwork but I never get paid. So do not work for this guy. Jerry Allen from Upwork is a scammer!,0
"It is pretty unfortunate that oDesk and Elance merged into this garbage called Upwork. I used to like working in the former sites, but this has turned into an abominable place. Extremely rude policy and customer service, demonic algorithms, and a place for spammers without any qualification to work in their fields.",0
how to start work with up work? how the payments are going to be paid? What is the rate of payment?is it safe & secure to work with up- work? i want a better guide from the experts.,0
They take huge commissions from worker and do not listen worker's dispute policy. They have suspended millions of accounts without any notice. I know there are no freelance sites who care workers. Specially for Asian workers. Jesus didn't die with their guilty.,0
"I received an email from Upwork today claiming I have a possible online interview for a job at CBRE. I set up the interview per the emailed instructions and about 10 min into it there were red flags everywhere--the person posing as hiring manager is asking me to buy $200 worth of iTunes cards to be used to ""upgrade a laptop"" they are sending me next week so that I can work right away. I called a local CBRE office and confirmed it was a scam. So shame on you Upwork! I deleted my account right way.",0
What a total waste of space on the internet. A curated club of self proclaimed professionals. With a site that only serves to profit off the skills of others. Not cool enough? Then good luck getting on. They only want people who will make them money. They do not care about the actual work.,0
terrible website with terrible support. A professional developer will never not fall on so bottom as use upwork. Think about before using it.,0
"upwork is a complete joke for a freelance site. If you were banned by them, they did you a BIG favor and saved you from lots of future grief and possibly financial theft. There are many more opportunities out there for freelance work and you can make more than 2.50/hour that represent the bulk of jobs on upwork! I find it amusing that they are banning users from various 3rd world countries and their whole outfit is outsourced from 3rd word countries!! Whomever took control of this lame site from elance, which was very good freelancer site, is a complete idiot and will turn this freelance site into fail mode. I pity their shareholders.",0
"I received an email that my profile was set to private because I haven't landed any jobs yet. But almost all the jobs I can have requirements like 90% success rate et al, that I can't match because I haven't done prior work through upwork. Have you any idea how hard it is to land a job when everyone wants prior upwork experience? It's a catch22! And now they make my profile private unless I pay to upgrade because I haven't been able to get around that? What the hell? This is a scam!",0
"A complete nightmare of a network, I strongly believe it's due to the fact they use offshore call centers or support team that have no idea on how to deal with the international business community and its standards! A complete pity because there some good potential clients in there, how do you cancel a worker after he clocked hundreds of hours on the basis of ID, that we supplied you with?",0
"Saw at least 10 unfilled roles on there advertised that were firmly in the area I work in, couldn't even get my profile accepted. Completely not transparent, waste of time!",0
I worked at Upwork very hard and so I had good work history. By the way one of my clients had problem at his bank account and so my Upwork account was closed by this problem. I cannot work at Upwork anymore. I think that it's not my false and that is client's problem. The Upwork is very very very $#*!.,0
"This review site does not offer a review grade of 0 stars. Pity, as UpWork does not deserves a 1 star rating. This platform is centered around exploiting freelancers and ruling out any means necessary to keep them quiet, controlled and working (biblical reference to slavery fully intended). Desktop application that tracks time and work has an option to take regular webcam shots of you while working that UpWork recommends to use (I am not kidding). Platform has full power over status of freelancers profile and can (and will!) block, inspect and pause any kind of work relationship with a client at any time. Platform will occasionally inform you that your account is blocked until you prove your legitimacy over online talk. Support forum is utterly controlled by trained moderators to keep all discussions in UpWork favor. Posts that intend to start out a discussion about improving/adding functionalities that benefit freelancers and clients will just get deleted without notice. Your (freelancers) data is available to public simply to drag traffic to the site and you can not turn that off. I have concluded 3 projects, got highest ranking on them, earned solid money and met great clients there. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the platform that aims to exploit and not develop, I still keep my profile only as a reference of work that I have done on it. Believe me, mine and yours time is precious. Don't let yourself be exploited here.",0
"I talked with upwork to recover my account cos my account was suddenly deactivated. I even submitted my personal informations like idcard and bank statements, but they are all scammers! They just got them and closed my account. I hate upwork! They are all scammers and report this site to online community!",0
I can't imagine this company will stay in business for very long. They froze my account saying there was suspicious activity which they couldn't explain and expected me to send them a copy of my licence or passport!!! Are they crazy? Who would share that type of information? Something is going on so beware if you have an account with them. Now I'm reviewing every single charge from them with my employee because I'm sure something isn't right.,0
"My work was really good and I got some jobs and got rewarded for that. But Upwork customer service sucks and they are very blunt on your face and don't even reply to your mails or give solutions or help you to improve. Better be helpful to people, who are in need. Good luck.",0
"I had been a freelancer at Upwork since 2014. I have found lots of clients there and have payed the 10% fee in exchange for their service as a job posting board and payment platform. Then things started to change - first, everybody were limited in the amount of the proposals they can make (~30 a month), then they had raised their fees to exorbitant 20%. I have landed a full time job, and left Upwork account to collect dust. Lately I have returned to Upwork and after making 5 proposals, my account was forcefully switched to invisible (It was their new drug dealer style policy - if you do not bring them money NOW, you will not get anything valuable from them) , and after about a week my account was suspended. Emails were answered by a robot. I had never seen such rude and unprofessional attitude to the freelancers who are milked by their exorbitant 20% fees, treated like slaves with no rights, and kicked out for no reasons.",0
I worked on upwork with over 1 year and always tried my best to satisfy my clients. But they suddenly blocked me without any reason. I tried my best to recover my account but they simply told that there are too many scammers in Asia. I can't stand! Will never use Upwork!,0
"I would grade lower since I did manage to hire a relatively good freelancer on the platform, however the reason I'm giving Upwork a 1 star grading is far more significant. It's on more than one occasion freelancers misrepresented their work history by claiming work they haven't done. Upworks response, other than a generic ""we will look into it"" was that they can take responsibility only for the projects that were done on it's platform, but they do not take any responsibly for a freelancers' lies in regards any work that was done through a different medium. A valid excuse for a startup, not a multi million $ company that is just trying to waver any responsibility. I had no choice but to contact the affected companies directly .",1
"Upwork suspended my account for no good reason, quoting that I am working outside of upwork with clients. Infact if the client itself is non responsive where is our fault. Stupid behavior shown by the support team quoting no need to contact them as account is suspended.",0
"Too many problems to make it worth it. I was able to rehire a freelancer I have worked with many times with Elance through Upwork, but never able to pay them through their system. Tried and tried to get Upwork to fix the issue, but they never resolved the broken links for me to access my account. Had to pay my freelancer through paypall. Done with Upwork. Elance was great. Upwork sucks.",0
"Suddenly one day they suspended my account permanently and blocked my funds. I worked hard on Upwork to improve my rating to top rated and I was on the way to be top rated, however they suspended my account blocking my funds. No reason was cited for suspension of my account. I am highly disappointed with their action and also concerned about my funds earned. I am planning to take legal action against Upwork if I get good support from freelancers who have affected by abrupt suspension of account by Upwork.",0
My account is already blocked and I couldn't get 3500 from UpWork. So do they get this amount? Don't work on UpWork. You will lose the amounts that you worked with clients on this site.,0
Upwork never allows for freelancers to signup. They are even making old top freelancers suspended or blocked It's awful Never signup there!,0
"I had a 90+ % job success score with Upwork. Eventually my shoulders started hurting a lot and I couldn't work at the computer much. Finally, I had to have surgery on BOTH shoulders. They only do one shoulder at a time and you have to go through all the physical therapy and get your range of motion back before they do the other shoulder. Anyway, I finally got to the point where I could take serious editing jobs again and I went to my Upwork account and found they had downgraded my success score to 75%!!! As you can see from my attached photo, I was a ""top rated freelancer"" with Upwork. Apparently, they got tired of not being able to take their exorbitant 20% fee from my earnings for such a long time, so they lowered my score, but you can check my job history - nothing but good client reviews. Upwork refuses to make any allowance for my being legitimately incapacitated by surgeries even if I send in documentation of the surgeries and lengthy PT. Word to the wise: If you value your professional reputation, stay away from Upwork. If you use their platform, youd better not have a lengthy illness or injury. Do yourself a favor and find another freelancing website. Better yet, build your own website and invest in marketing it - that way you can keep 100% of your earnings!",0
"I'm new to Upwork as a customer. I know this name through Elance that is mentioned on so many website for its content writing. I need to hire contents for my website. Unbelievable! the price of an article is processing fee + fee from the client + fee from the writer. Even they suggest me a fee for posting a job that can be seen by many writers. I need a review article for Amazon products and I send an offer with links. They remove all the links and send me a message for violating their TOS. Today, I again receive a message that talks me not pay for a writer without specific reasons. I don't know what is this, I also pay for my offers, even there are some articles that I can't use because broken English. They told me that I violate their TOS and threat to disable my account. Here is the message: ""Hi Sieu, We are contacting you to let you know we have removed a job you recently posted.

"poor customer service, it sucks, my account has been suspended for multiple proposal , I have a lot of previous jobs and got 5 stars feedback, I did pass all the information to many time to upwork and nothing happened but thanks to my client he still paid me thru paypal.",0
They withheld the connects that I had subscribed for just because they were carried forward and though I was applying for the proposals clients did not respond. They do not have a stron policy for the payment that a freelancer makes. Very bad policy.,0
This review is NOT FAKE. It's impossible to contact any live person if you have any issues with a Freelancer. Wish I had found this site before I paid a Freelancer $750....to build a website that was full of errors,0
"My all freelaancers are very good i found from UPWORK, But UPWORK company by itself is very bad for customer service. I will go back to freelance.com at lease they care about there clinets. I have three times check with paypal and they advised me that they have paid to upwork with reference. I did pass all the information to many time to upwork. but they still saying your ticket is for investigation. I have paid 2 times money from my bank account and they still have suspended my contract and my freelancers not got paid. Anyway i will pay to my freelancer by otherway So my worker doesn't my bad image bu upwork mistakes.",0
"All the money is shipped offshore as soon as it is deposited. Every client is Western and every contractor is ISIS. Many contractors had names like Tom, $#*! and Harry but they communicate in broken English. The hiring system makes it impossible for anyone imported from oDesk or Elance to get hired. I went from a level 11 with 4.8 stars on Elance to an unexplained 63% completion rate on Upwork. I contested this arbitrary 63% completion rate since out of nearly 100 contracts I only returned/refused 2. They got back to me over 6 MONTHS later saying they would look into it. The site is a fraud. You are better off surfing Craigslist.",0
"The problem with Upwork is that they make it verrry difficult for freelancers who are new to get hired, because Upwork makes metrics recommendations to clients when they are posting their available jobs. These recommendations are things like hire only ""rising stars"" or hire only freelancers who have a ""90% job success score"" - and in order for a freelancer to be included in either of these categories, they have to have a certain number of jobs under their belt which is impossible to do if clients won't hire you because you don't have a certain number of jobs under your belt. Much better results on freelancer.com.",0
"I was on upwork looking for someone to help get my new website visible on google. I didn't want to take the time to figure it out and I figure for a pro it shouldn't be very difficult and fairly easy to do. Now that I have taken the time to learn how to do it myself I see how badly they got burned me. As well as how little they did. To start off the person who I originally spoke to was a male from India. I Decided to hire him and he says you have to work with my other account. This account has reached its maximum amount of customers. I will message you from my other account and you can hire me through that account.   This should have been my first red flag... I get a message from a female that he he is pretending to be. However having had some experiences on eBay and Amazon and how much they manipulate and control you ... I give him the benefit of the doubt and I continued on. I had to give him some passwords and access to some accounts. Since he's on the other side of the world the two step authentication kicked in. He sends me a screen shot of the second question it was asking. The screen shot also said which I caught ""someone from Afghanistan is trying to login to this account"". I thought that's odd. He said he's from India.  Red flag #2....... again I look past this red flag because I just wanted to become visible in google. I didn't care where the person was from I just wanted to be visible yesterday. After I think it was 15 hours of paid ""work"" I still could not find my site in google. So he said that I had needed to do link building which was very time consuming and that would run me $100 a week for 6-7 months. I had said at that point if it's necessary I want to do it but give me a couple of weeks to make some money as well as iI want to research it and we can discuss it then. I don't have any conversation with the guy and a week later I see $100 charge on my credit card. This goes on for 3 weeks until I finally cancel the card. Not happy since we didn't discuss it like I had said I wanted to. I just swept it under the rug and was just going to move on. I didn't want go dwell on $300 when I had so much to do to launch this business that worrying about it would just bring me down potentially costing me more. I then started to learn google. It turns out all he did was make an AdWords account with 15-20 irrelevant keywords and post the google analytics code in the section in on Shopify. 20 minutes worth of work tops. l Again not pleased but I don't dwell on it. It had been about 6 weeks at this point since I had been trolled out of money and I just wanted to continue to go forward ....... Here's what pushed me over the edge and is now prompting this review. TODAY I GET AN EMAIL FROM UPWORK THREATENING TO SEND ME TO COLLECTIONS FOR WORK I NEVER AUTHORIZED. THEY ARE ENABLING THESE PEOPLE TO SCAM AMERICANS. THEY DIDNT REACH OUT TO ME TO SEE IF THERE IS A PROBLEM. THEY JUST THREATEN TO RUIN MY CREDIT.  GENERALLY WE PAY CONTRACTORS WHEN THE WORK IS DONE. ALL THE THINGS I ASKED FOR THAT I DIDNT MENTION STILL ARE NOT CONPLETED EXCEPT FOR THE TASKS IVE DONE MYSELF. WORST COMPANY EVER DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH UPWORK. UPDATE TO THIS REVIEW: They never replied to my questions on the legitimacy of my bill and have sent me to COLLECTIONS.... PLEASE DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY.  FOR THE RECORD I HAVE HAD POOR EXPERIENCES WITH FIVERR AND FREELANCER AS WELL. THE PEOPLE YOUR DEALING WITH ON THESE SITES KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE GAME WITH THESE WEBSITES. SO THEY WILL INSTRUCT YOU TO DO CERTAIN THINGS ALONG THE WAY THAT LEAVE YOU NO RECOURSE. ALL OF THESE SITES ARE BAD. IN THE LONG RUN IT HAS COST ME LESS TO HIRE A LOCAL PERSON. I HAVE HAD BETTER LUCK POSTING A GIG ON CRAIGSLIST. ACTUALLY I HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASED WITH THE HELP I HAVE FOUND THERE.",1
"Never worked there..did not know who they were, Somehow they got my Paypal account information and made several hundred dollars of withdrawals. BEWARE of this company...they are NOT legit!",0
I just wanted to sign up to do some translating and filled in a basic profile. The a**holes rejected my application. Use a less pompous app like Airtasker or Freelancer.,0
"I used upwork for 3 months and meanwhile, I met 3 clients. And I got 5 star reviews always and could keep 100% job success. One day, I was just requested to provide my id card and bank statement without any reason. Actually, id card and bank statement is the personal info which we cannot like share. But I uploaded it and after receiving it, upwork closed my account! THEY DIDN'T TELL THE REASON! HORRIBLE, TERRIBLE EXPERIENCD! DON'T USE UPWORK! SCAMMERRRRRR!!!",0
"After finally finding some hope to make honest work from home! I was extremely disappointed when I received an email informing me that my account was suspended because I did not get hired for a month. I just finished my profile in June and I only spent 40 connections not even all of them, and UpWork team decided to ban my account with no empathy at all. I have sent them this email Greetings, Trust & Safety Team, While I understand that pruning the Upwork tree is the only sure-fire way to keep it leech-free, please consider reactivating my account, towards which goal I bring the following reasons: - I have indeed been very active in the previous month, that being because I plan to work through this website for a long time and I need to build experience on it, as lack of previous worked hours on the platform seriously hinders success with the applications. - Apart from that, I was aware of the fact that there is a monthly limit, but not that you can use that up in any way that would endanger your account. - I am also aware that some of my Cover Letters were very similar if not identical, but that seemed normal seeing that the jobs had identical requirements. - In this time, I have had replies from most of these employers; indeed most preferred to hire people with previously worked hours through Upwork, but at least three of these companies accepted my application, gave me tests already; one let me know they will notify me when there is a vacancy, from another one I am waiting for an answer and I just had an interview last night with the third, who will contact me very soon for starting training, as per their words, that is if I still have a working account with you, since I am not sure that they send payment through any other platform. I include some screenshots here for verification. You can also check my profile and verify that, while not being the most experienced yet, I nevertheless am not among the worst here and I should bring no losses to your table. Please reconsider reactivating my account if only with a stricter limit of monthly applications if you consider that fit, but at least help me not to have lost the time and hopes dedicated exclusively to this site lately. Thank you very much for your time and hope to hear from you soon about it. Best Regards, AbdElRahman And this was their reply:Hello Abdelrahman ElBagoury, I am writing to let you know that we have carefully reviewed your appeal and determined that your Upwork account will remain suspended. We know this is not the news you wanted to receive, however at this point the appeal process is exhausted and our decision is final. If you have any open contracts you will be able to complete that work and receive payment through our site. You will not be able to submit proposals for new contracts, however. We wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. Please note that it is unlikely that we will respond to any future correspondence regarding this matter. Regards, Apple Upwork Trust & Safety",0
"I bid on several jobs and got none. Then I built my own website and hired someone to promote it. They said they would give my site backlinks. I later found out paying for backlinks was discouraged by Google. Was the five star rated freelancer so stupid that he did not know? So even five star freelancers are not helpful enough to give ANY positive return on investment. I am sure all clients would agree, upwork promotes fraudulent behavior in freelancers, for example it helps a freelancer to do a ""course"" or buy a review (which upwork does not do enough to prevent) or listen to some ""expert"" freelancer who is so incapable that his business relies on upwork to succeed. On top of that, you lose 20% of what you pay as upwork's commission fee, so if you pay $1000,you are actually paying the freelancer $800. This is a waste of money as I found out the hard way, and many freelancers indulge in black hat practices that will lower your site's rankings. Even upwork tests have been asking the same questions for years..there are many sites which give the questions and answers of upwork tests and freelancers use these to pass tests. People who are defending upwork obviously benefit a lot from all this, like Danny Margulies who has a private forum dedicated to succeeding on upwork,and people who regularly write mere words for $125 an hour. Stay away, and stay safe.",1
"I was very active on Elance before the merger and name-change. Elance was GREAT in every way. As soon as it became Upwork, it took MONTHS of issues only to migrate my profile, and after that, I was told I had to provide new bank information. I did so, and a day later, found three fraudulent withdrawals. I complained to the FBI (interstate commerce) with no help, and aside from my bank being nice about crediting me for the fraud, I still had to close all my bank accounts because of that. DO NOT TRUST THIS SITE!",0
"Upwork is being run by a group of $#*!ty people who are just greedy for money. I don't say it is a scam, it is 100% legit and also I have earned a decent amount from upwork. but the upwork management sucks. Recently my account got suspended for no reason. when I asked them to provide me a reason then they simply refused and they also charge 20% from each service you provide and also a withdrawal fee and also a very low conversation rate. moreover if unfortunately if you get in a dispute which is not a big issue because it can happen as there are plenty of frauds. in that case upwork again find new ways to launder money from freelancers. I can say if you are working fine on upwork then you are very lucky and a suggestion don't login your account from any other device or from app because app suck. even though your project get spoiled but don't try to login on any other device if your care about your account.",0
"Avoid - July 2017. Having been scammed before when working directly with freelancers, but having good experiences with fiverr, I needed a place to get some development done. I was delighted to find responsive developers and an escrow system and had my first job completed within 24 hours and happily released funds. And then, I couldn't get the freelancer to do any more jobs. Apparently, they couldn't get the money from Upwork either. I queried this with Upwork and was told they had permanently suspended the developer with the weasily response "".. we are unable to provide details as to why we have done this"". Great! So the great experience I have with the freelancer, upwork decide to bin for a reason that only upwork knows, and force to me to find another way to work with the developer. It literally doesn't get worse than this. If upwork cared for their customers (like me) they would at least have the decency not to hide their reasons. So upwork have my escrow money sitting in their account earning interest. My freelancer hasn't been paid. Bad result.",0
All they want is your banking info. Total Scam. It's a shame how companies like this prey on those looking for an honest living.,0
"I used Upwork for a month and they just suspend my account with 0 explanation. During the suspension, Upwork took all the money I earned from clients and gave no reason why I was suspended. Then they required me to upload my personal information (ID and bank statement) for further verification. After submitting required documents, Upwork just decided to ban my account and again with no explanation.",0
"This is a scam to get your banking information. They take your info then cancel your account, but do not give you any way to delete your information. Avoid!!!!",0
"I just experienced the biggest nightmare of my life, working with an Upwork vendor. He's a 3D animator by the name of Sergey Petrukevich. He repeatedly tried to blackmail me for more money throughout the job. I kept Upwork in the loop during the project and afterward, asked them to sandbox him for good so he could not attempt to extort anyone else.They PUNISHED ME! Upwork obviously approves of their vendors holding clients to ransom for more money. It now all makes sense. The more a vendor robs a client of additional monies, the more Upwork gets paid. If you value your wallet and your sanity, avoid Upwork like the plague. For me, this was like fending off a rapist, reporting him to the police and then being thrown in prison for assaulting the person who tried to rape me. Yes, it was just about this bad.",1
"As long as one finds the professional(s) she was looking for, the system works. It's sloppy (as of the UI), but works: money put in escrow, the freelancer does the job, gets paid when finished and both parties are happy. The issues come when any, literally any problem raises, especially for when the freelancer fails to deliver: As of Upwork handling your money: It runs back from escrow to your bank account. There are no other options for this. Can't be held in escrow, no ""client account"" in the system or anything. Means, if the job must get done, so should be posted again, it should also be financed again while one waits for the escrow money to arrive back to the bank account... Adding to this, if the freelancer doesn't approve this action (e.g. she was gone for good, so won't be around to do so, or simply doesn't care), it takes a good 12-14 business days (in my experience) to get the money back. As of Upwork handling you, as the ""valued"" customer: If one asks for help, gets the standardized, copy-pasted answer. If one asks for a solution, gets the same thing, as well as an excuse (mostly ""our system works like that""...). If one complains stating this is not good. Gets a negative remark on her account.... I understand those who rate this site 3+ stars. I felt the same way for my 1st, minor project as I found the right candidate and the job was done. BUT as soon as things go serious, investment goes high and actual professionals should be found for the large scale job, the system starts stuttering, the safety net is gone and one has to realize this site is useless, its processes are killing and very, very silly, as well as the support is impotent. I definitely do not recommend using this site ever, for any business. Find someone better. It won't be difficult, go to any other provider...",1
I HAVE GONE TO THE TROUBLE OF REGISTERING AS A CLIENT AND TRIED 10 TIMES TO POST A JOB - NOT POSSIBLE!!!! THE FUNCATIONALITY IS USELESS!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AS I HAVE DONE - I CANNOT GET ANY ASSISTANCE.,0
"I am a high profile freelancer, worked for some very reputable clients and with years of a successful freelancer career. I've invested a lot of time and efforts to make my Upwork profile stand out and I did it. I carefully selected what work to show on my Portfolio, I've taken a lot of skill tests on the system in order to prove my expertise. And it worked for some time. But guess what happened to me this year - they asked me for ID and other documents to prove my identity, this process was hard enough because they rejected my ID image and wanted me to take another shot at it especially for them and then resubmit it. I did it and finally after days spent I was able to verify my profile. Now (a month later) they just permanently terminated my account without any real reason given. I received a blanket ""explanation"", that after a quick Google search I found out it was nothing more than a blanket message, sent to many Upwork freelancers, who also ended up with their accounts terminated. I've tried to at least ask for the real reason, but they failed to provide one. They don't care for freelancers, they are only moved by their own interest on the back of the freelancer community. I believe anyone, who wants to start a freelancer career on Upwork deserves to know the truth how freelancers are treated. - you will spend a lot and a lot of time and efforts to build your profile, - you'll be charged 20% (!!!) for the services, that you provide, - and you may end up with a permanently terminated account at any time, with no explanation whatsoever and no possibility to appeal it. All in all I think Upwork is a very wrong place to make a freelancer career online, really toxic for your career development. They will feed on you and your skills, but will dump you out whenever they want. You have no rights there. Like back in the days of slavery. Don't get burned just like I did.",0
"This site is totally against employees. Even if you are a good professional, if you don't have high upwork rating, you will have to chase employers and beg them to give you a chance to make their job done. If you are a beginner, better never login on upwork.",0
"I entered all my personal and financial info into upwork and then got rejected. I sent this: You should have told me upfront that total rejection was a possibility. I could have been working on getting real work. There was just no indication of this. I would never have gone forward. I like businesses that are upfront and honest about what they are doing to collect your personal information. My motto is honesty and integrity and that is inconsistent with who you are and what you offer. Then I got to thinking about it and said: You dont even have {my skill] listed as a skill yet you have enough of those folks? Lets see, you dont list the skill but you already have too much. I am so sorry I gave you my information. I want all of my personal info deleted from your system. Then they sent mail that they didn't have any need for ANY of my skills. So first they have too much of what I have but now they don't need those skills period because no clients are calling for them. They can't even do simple logic or math. Then I said: Your clients suffer because you limit the possibilities of who they can get. I have unique skills and approaches. You give your clients the first people who signed up with similar skills. They should know this. They should know they might not be getting the best because you have rejected everyone who might be better. Then I said: Why did I have to provide a bank account before being accepted? Are you going to try and steal my money? Now I'm waiting for them to take out the verification deposits. I will flag those as scam charges with the bank. I also wondered if my picture helped them disqualify me since I do look older than 60 and maybe I really am. The business lacks substance, integrity, honesty and consistency and I would stay away as a client or worker. Contact me directly if you need a great consultant!",0
"Contradictory to what they claim, Upwork does not offer any protection to writers against dishonest clients. I had a client who was paying me $10 for small content writing projects. The problem here was that for each project, I had to purchase some material which went up to $3 in some cases. As a service provider, I believed I was within my rights to ask her how much profits I will make because of this - Total paid - $10 (-)Cost of purchase - $2 to $3 (-)Upwork fee of 20% - $2 of $10 How much I actually make/project - $6 or lesser for more expensive material And these were projects that took a consistent work of at least 6 hours at a stretch, plus all the actual publishing and other things. Upwork promptly sends me an email saying I asked to be paid outside of the website when in fact the CONTRACT was STARTED ON THE SITE and work was submitted through it! The client said that they pay direct, which being an experienced writer, I assumed to mean that she had some understanding with Upwork for lesser paying projects. Now I don't know what happened of her but she may probably just start another profile or so. However, one of my sources of income is lost because such a big website cannot protects its writers from whom it takes a 20% commission EACH TIME when they have voiced a genuine concern and HAVE A WORKING CONTRACT. Plus, there's barely any well-paying projects there and most clients are not payment verified. Disgusted and thoroughly disappointed and would discourage anyone who asks from making a profile there.",0
"I forgot my password and I cannot even log in for weeks because their web site is so poorly set up that it does not allow for password restore. It keeps cycling back to asking you for password. Even after I reported this via email I have not heard back from anyone. Secondly, the categories are so poorly designed that it's almost impossible to find the 'right' category because they are so inflexible and they pigeon-hole you into 'IT' or 'non-IT'. For those who are adept in several fields, they almost get shut out of the right opportunities. My gosh, just bring the odesk back. After the new upwork, it is way worse than the old one! good luck finding gigs. don't waste your time here.",0
"I started filling out an online profile on this website so I could make a little extra money with my general admin and data entry skills. It asks you to basically fill out a new resume for some basic freelance work... ok. So I am in the middle of this and selecting jobs that I may interested in and Upwork is supposed to be verifying my bank account for payments etc. Then I receive an email from Upwork support, before I have even completed my profile mind you, stating they are not interested in me and I am not qualified. They know nothing about me yet!! I haven't finished filling out my current and previous work experience. What a joke!",0
"I was using oDesk for ~10 years and liked it, but after it was merged with Elance and started implementing new policies it is terrible to use. High fees, ridiculous terms, fewer payout options, more delays. And recently they just suspended my funds with no reason and require me to video call them to get them back. That was a last drop of my patience. I quit Upwork. And now I even can not close my account. It says ""Thank you for using Upwork. At this time we are unable to close your account.""",0
Hard to use platform. quite Expensive Fee with Incompetent staff know only words we need verification of of the time and then Suspend your account suddenly without providing any solid reason. They need to focus on more jobs as 90 percent of new comers are struggling and they get nothing. Big blunder.,0
"Hard to use platform, quite Expensive Fee, lack of response or suitable attention support from helpdesk. Happily closed the account.",0
"Never in my professional experience have I experienced worse. This 'company' needs to be held accountable for ineptitude, incompetence and a complete inability to deal with the customer. I spent last Monday on the phone trying to get an agent - any agent on the phone. The phone rang out several times, eventually when the number ran out again the message indicated that this number was no longer in service. We called a different number within the system and same end result. This time we were told to leave a message and we would be called back in 24 hours!!! I tried the following day again and immediately a young employee picked up the phone. She was totally incapable of solving the problem this company was having with UpWork. In the meantime, we continued to get these inane e mails with a donotreply address that were completely at cross purposes with our attempt to problem solve. In short, if I as the CEO of a company billed this entity for my time trying to make contact with them -my bill would far outweigh the bill I owed them. Close them down is my recommendation. Dreadful, dreadful and dreadful. Also.....they employ people in foreign lands to answer phones! How about forcing them to employ people in the USA.",0
"My sister who worked for oDesk (now Upwork) was before earning hefty sums of money from just working for the then oDesk. Suddenly, her account was terminated for no apparent reason. She told me that she contacted the US Office, and they promised to reinstate her which they did. However, when the oDesk (Upwork) Philippine branch saw this, they hurriedly closed her account once more for no apparent reason.",0
I earned $1000 from my client and all the funds were released. And suddenly upwork wanted to have a chat with me. We had a chat and then I saw that my financial account is limited. All the funds were sent back to the client. Piece of joke. Never work there . They only suck their client's $#*! but never cares for the freelancers who're keeping it running.,0
I used it as a client but I heard from the smart and 'capable' developers that is even worse for them,0
"My account is still active but today I Close My Account and I am very happy with that. 20% service fee, what a scam, if upwork think I don't have any place to freelance work then they are the ........... I bring 17 Elance Client to freelancer.com and now my freelancer.com job review ( 117 ) are more then upwork. The lowest, cheapest, scam marketplace DownWork",0
"Se let my empty my bowels of the disgust i have for UPWORK. I paid for the account, found clients worked for them. Got paid once and after that received an email from them that i need to have a call with one of their reps. They told me to state my name and address, which i did. They asked me what AJAX stands for which i didn't know the definition off (I never stated i do AJAX on my profile). After that question the representative hung up. 3 minutes later i receive an email stating ""Your account is suspended"". I write to them to explain what i did wrong and get some bogus reply that my personal data is incorrect. If someone from UPWORK is reading this atleast be consistent and cite the same reason of suspension. Not first time your personal data is incorrect and in the second write you are in breach of policies. to sum it up.... stay away from UPWORK!!!",0
"I never got a working copy of the software I hired a freelancer to develop for me. Upwork tied up my money in escrow and would not release it. Said I had to go through arbitration, and pay for it, which would have cost more than the amount I had tied up in their escrow account. I've always had mostly bad luck with sites like this (elance, too).",0
Account suspended saying not suitable to our platform even there were many jobs for me been a 3D Artist. Its just been a new freelancer it takes time. What right they have saying that. Very unstable and pathetic response. zero understanding and helpful behaviour.,0
"I sed to like Upwork at the time odesk. Now they have become sooooo crazy expensive and bad that almost ever job I have put there was problematic. Their review system does not work as it is easy to manipulate. Upwork is the best place to lose money and not get nothing in return, but trouble and waist of time.",0
"This website has become worst after the merger of odesk and elance. Both platforms were great until some fool gave them an idea to merge them together. Now they don't know what they are doing. No planning, no management, no customer support, nothing. They are taking people's lives as a joke.",0
Nice idea but I've encountered more scammers than legitimate clients offering legitimate work. And some of the job offers seem shady and perhaps even illegal. I've had very few actual legit freelance jobs on upwork. You can flag them but they keep popping up everywhere. Seems like there should be a better vetting process for clients looking for freelancers. I recently had a client who refused to pay me after I had completed the job and left me a false negative review. After filing a dispute there was not much I could do. A lot of wasted time and keep getting scammed.,0
Account suspended without any warning. Reason: used too many connects and didn't get enough jobs. i used 40 connects a month didnt even use all 60 :D,0
"Hello Guys , Upwork.com is a Worst platform ever i have seen in my life. Is this makes any sense to suspend account cause of sending just few proposals while i have 4 very good reviews on my upwork.com profile and my 12$ i am unable to withdraw. Money does not matter not at all. Before account suspension must be generate a warning email with some suggestions , tips and cautions. I was try to build by business while one day i get an email from upwork.com your account is suspended and that news was a horrible dream for me. Please dont try this keep away.",0
"As long as Odesk & Elance lasted, they were good platforms with excellent and genuine projects for freelancers. However, a clever shark seems to have taken over and blended into the current Upwork format. They never allow projects to be awarded to you if you are from outside US and can perform better than US freelancers. They somehow surreptitiously curtail and edit the client-freelancer communication. And then like predatory hyenas wait to suspend freelancer's account after a superficial review where they entice you to reveal and send them your degrees. Beware, their practices reflect they are about to finish as an honest business platform.",0

"Upwork recently suspended account without any reason. They told me that there's some violation regarding asking client's payment via paypal or something. But i never did, i asked some for some proof, they din't replied me either. Moreover, just before getting suspended. I used to move my entire Clients either from other platforms / Facebook / Twitter and real life ones to upwork, so i could make my portfolio. But upwork ruined it at all. This is disgusting and totally unacceptable. I've referred 12 new people to use Upwork but now i am going to aware them with its reality that they're just like hell.

They suspended me for sending too many proposal when in real life situations that's like sending many CV to many potential clients. What sort of people would suspend you for actually trying to find a successful contact for you to start work??? What a horrible site. Turns out I'm not the only one who had problem with the site. To summaries my experience with UPWORK.com they are not helpful at all. Not helpful to those who are genuinely looking for freelance work. Giving them 1 star isn't even worth it. They deserve no star.,0
Try to keep away from this platform. You risk to be tricky by lots of scammers protected by them or to be humiliated by their `gurus` in forum. Their behavior is very violent and you will be verbally abused by a three or more them at the same time. The worst experience ever.,0
"A client owes me 100$ for an underpaid work. Upwork bans me after I submit the work and tells me that if the client pays me, they collect 20% as fee. if the client doesnt pay me I can basically screw myself and cry about it. Winners are keepers, loosers are weepers. Not the exact words, but I cant explain the situation any better. Moreover, customer service gets judgmental on their silly rules rather than my earnings from hard work. My client ignores me, and Upwork doesnt give a $#*!. I am trying to haunt them on social media to remidn them of their responsability to do more for ensuring me one last payment pending. Dont wish to work for them anymore, but ensure my payment.",0

I used UpWork for the very first time and I lost over $500 from a scammer they admitted has been taking advantage of customers before. They referred me to their legal small print when asked about getting funds back and getting a way to take action on the provider. Highly recommend that you think twice.,0
"Not sure how or where to start. Working through UpWork has been a nightmare. I'll try to summarize my experience. All I wanted was a simple game for both iOS and Android. Posted my job, received plenty of candidates and chose a freelancer based on her work portfolio. Her name was Natasha Korecki. I explained exactly what I wanted, gave her references, example of similar games and I even sent her a document with everything written of what I want. We agreed on hours, which kept increasing due to her not being able to finish on time. She started working ok design and graphics, which I did like, however, the final completed product was not even remotely close to what I wanted nor what she has been designing. At this point, we're at the ending and we're going back and forth about re-designing. Keep in mind, the whole time, I've been in contact with UpWork to makes sure they have my back. We agree agreed on redesign but she needed more more, which she had plenty of to finish and what we Agee did upon. Now, to save me the headache and stress, I agreed to just get it over with and keep the current design. The game was submitted and approved by Android, however, it was rejected by Apple. Once I went back to Natasha to fix the issue, she kept pushing me to start a new game with her. I explained, we'll discuss once my current game is approved and good to go. She has declined to fix it, unless I start a new game. She also declined giving me the source code to have someone else fix, unless I start a new game. I even received an email from UpWork stating that during their routine investigation, they found the freelancer being linked to a group that was kicked out for inappropriate conduct. Now to UpWork. I've been emailing them back and forth for over a month. All I keep getting is ""unfortunately"" this ""unfortunately"" that. I've been dealing mostly with Mark. I explained my experience over and over but I don't seem to be getting anywhere. Finally, he forwarded me to another team. Keep in mind, this was all over email, there is no support/customer service phone number anywhere, so it's frustrating to get my point across. I was excited to get a call from Michelle from the Talent specialist department. Once talking to her, and spent few minutes explaining my situation, she tells me, I only assist in helping with hiring freelancers, but she can let her team know. Now I'm even more frustrated. But wait, there's more. When I asked her to please have someone call me instead of email, she did not sound assuring as she stated, they may not be able to call, as we use emails for tracking. As that might be understandable, we are at a different level now and customer satisfaction should be first priority. Sorry for the long text, just wanted to share with everyone thinking about using them. You're basically on your own.",1
"I will skip the part about their huge fees which basically doubled last year, leaving a freelancer with about 70-75% of the money a client pays. I won't even complain about the stupid job completion getting ruined because a client left a contract open for possible work after completing the contract, and dropping my completion ratio for no reason and resulting in no more proposals. What made me quit upwork was their overnight change in policy which requires a ton of information from me (a freelancer) that I refuse to provide - this is a completely unjustified invasion of privacy, I had no problem working happy with several clients without sharing my personal information. And by refusing to comply with their overnight policies the money I earned fair and square are now blocked into their account - I have some doubts this is even legal. Find another website, encourage competition to make things better. DO NOT encourage this trash.",0
There should be a no star option for this trash site. They DO NOT vet the jobs posted by the employers. So the site is FULL of scammers. They do however go overboard scrutinizing the freelancers to the point of stripping away any privacy.,0
"Upwork is the worst of them all... biggest mistake elance did was merge with odesk...suspended my account and i quote: We are contacting you to let you know we have suspended your access to Upwork indefinitely. Our decision is based on a careful review and the fact that you have submitted a high number of proposals for jobs on our site without many contracts or earnings. Unfortunately, this means the jobs posted by clients are not a good match for your skills. I know this news is likely disappointing to you. But our goal at Upwork is to enable freelancers to successfully connect and collaborate with clients who need their skills and expertise. Unfortunately, this means we must part ways with freelancers whose skills are not in demand in our marketplace. If you want to appeal this decision, you can email us at marketplace-appeals@upwork.com. Please note each case will be manually reviewed by our Trust & Safety team to decide if your account can be reinstated. Please know we dont make decisions like these lightly and wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. Regards, Upwork Trust & Safety What BS... since elance and odesk merged, i havnt gotten 1 client...i have a score of 5/5 from about 15 projects...not only i didnt get a client, i never got 1 response from a bid ive done... these new ""staff"" screen your bids... DO NOT USE UPWORK..WASTE OF ENERGY, EFFORT...its good for cheap labor and cheap clients",0
"I've put up with Upwork after Elance was bought out so as to keep my clients and, of course, find additional work. Shortly after, Upwork went completely gone downhill. Here's a short list of what you'll find: - Upwork has a horrible user interface; it's difficult for both clients and freelancers to figure out and use. - They keep your money for 10 days or more (I still haven't figured this part out) after you submit billing - Elance allowed freelancers to send up to 16 samples of their work when bidding on a job; Upwork allows you 1 (!!!) - Clients are much cheaper, but that's probably not Upwork's fault - The very worst move Upwork made was increasing their commission to a whopping 20% (you get 80 bucks for a $100 job). Utterly ridiculous and greedy. I've even stopped responding to invitations. - What to do? I'm going to check out remote.com. I've been getting solicitation emails from them and it certainly can't be worse than Upwork.",0
"My job completion score suddenly dropped despite all positive feedback. I figured it had to be some kind of computer error, so I emailed customer service. One rep claimed it was from a job in 2015 I had agreed with the client to leave open for the possibility of more work. Another rep claimed I HAD received negative feedback, but couldn't tell me which contract it was from or what the negative feedback was. (My profile shows zero negative feedback from clients.) And the other reps pretty much ignored everything I said and just sent copy/paste generic responses. And now, I just successfully completed another contract yesterday and received a full 5-star positive review from the client, and guess what? Job completion score remains the same! All of this for the OUTRAGEOUS 20 PERCENT we pay them as freelancers! What a joke! I gave them countless opportunities to make it right, they haven't had any interest in doing so.",0
Elance was a great platform for freelancers to work on. After merging with Upwork it has gone downhill in so many ways I can't even list it all here.,0
"The project ""e-commerce website"" order was made 3/29. The freelancer has not delivered the first milestone ""Beta site delivery"". Claimed the refund but nothing is happening. As of 4/22, UpWork confirmed by email. You requested a refund for your unused deposit of $250.00. If the freelancer ""NANCY KESHARY"" does not respond to your request within 7 days, the remaining balance in escrow will be automatically refunded to your payment method. Checking with the support team, the deposit had already been released to the freelancer 4/5. Now I claim to Paypal to get my full refund from Upwork. DO NOT TRUST WHAT THEY CONFIRM YOU!!!!",1
Just stay away from UpWork. The worst platform for freelancers. They use a score system that makes your feedback stars completely useless. I have 5 jobs completed successfully with 5 stars each and my success score is 60%. Many clients refuse to work with me because they ask : Why is your score that low? I talked to UpWork support team about my score and is like talking to a automated script. They keep sending me pre-made answers and links. Just stay away from it. you will regret investing time in making good reviews. Is just a waste of time,0
"I paid to upgrade my membership, and after taking my money they told me i did not qualify and told paypal that they delivered what i paid for? HELLO ? and how did they deliver what I paid for... they did not... Just glad i did not work for free....",0
"I've been with upwork since 2009, it was great when it was Odes, but then came the incompetent, low skilled support staff, who did not know their elbow from their ar#e! Just such and irritating experience to have these people close job posts and waste time for absolute no reason.",0
"Has to be the worst, most incompetent, scamming company in the history of scamming companies. The Freelancer I hired was obviously working on other things while supposedly working on my site and yet Upwork would still not refund any of my money. Even though there are clear screenshots of him working on things other than my site, and it took him 6 hours, over a 1 week period to do 30 minutes worth of work, in such a shoddy manner that it had to be redone, they still refused to refund me anything. On top of that they accused me of trying to pay the person offline, without any evidence whatsoever. The other freelancer I was working with at the same time was a bit better, but I have to say, if you ever hire someone to work on your site, never pay them by the hour. Always insist on a flat fee with a guarantee of what will be done and insist on a set refund if it isn't and pay as they go with strict milestones. such a ripoff!",1
"Upwork is a colossal predatory business. I've been on the platform for 4 years and saw business practices and treatments that only the worst of corporate monopolies can get away with. Especially after upwork swallowed Elance which was head and shoulders better. Contractors are screwed with high commission fees which DOUBLED last year and a rating system which forces contractors to constantly drum up new business for these corporate bastards just to keep their 5 star rating which is NOT based on actual performance but also on how much business you constantly bring in to upwork. So you can do flawless work and still get penalized. Then there is the notoriously bad and unresponsive customer service were you deal with $1/hr robotic contractors from India who show absolute disdain and lack of care when dealing with contractor issues. If you are a self employed freelancer or a small business offering services, unless you enjoy being a mistreated slave don't just avoid upwork RUN!",0
"The so-called Upwork Help Team does not seem to understand their own company's written policies and cancels job orders without any reason and, worse, without any response when you ask for clarification. Maybe they should use their own service to find people who are more qualified to actually provide support for paying customers.",0
"***PLEASE- Anyone who is having issues with theft from this company should report them to the Better Business Bureau.*** I would say contact a lawyer as well but as always, these cases are hard to prove and always seem to be in favor of the business so they continue to scam on**** I am having trouble setting up my profile, which I am being forced to do in order to have complete access to the provided tools but their website seems to be having a problem and is not accepting any profile picture I attempt to upload. They have no way of getting in touch with Customer Support and I am being sent in circles to look at templates that do not help me. Any reliable company would have a way to reach them, especially if they are dealing with money and other sensitive information.",0
"Suspended without any reason! I was writing to support, they answered me to contact them on email, I have sent a message and they never failed to respond",0
"They had some sort of technical issue with user verification. I added credit card, verificated emails and was still unable to get to the hiring process itself. I contacted support where I mostly got template answers and just that they are aware of the issue and they are working on it. As mad as it sounds but they said they didnt know where it's going to be fixed. It's been 3 months...",0
"I have been a successful freelance writer for years, primarily through Elance and private clients in my industry. I began freelancing on Elance and Odesk and both were considerably more responsive. The Upwork site is difficult to navigate and their policies, including 20% fees for freelancers and holding escrowed money for 6 days after release by client is ridiculous. I never work there intentionally but sometimes respond to interview requests.",0
I hired a freelancer on upwork to make an app for me.The freelancer logged manual hours and upwork released the funds to him with out asking me if i received anything in return which i had not.So in turn i lost $600.00 and they are putting the blame on me WHAT A SCAM SITE IT IS,1
"Save yourself countless hours that lead nowhere and skip this platform, it's VERY unprofessional in many different ways.",0
Upwork cannot be trusted! They say you can contact them via telephone and email but this is false. They also take unauthorised payments with no way to get them to resolve the dispute. Don't ever use this company. They should be taken to court.,0
"my partner joined up work as freelancer and received 5 starts for every job he did. he applied for multiple jobs and wasn't contracted to all of them so upwork indefinitely suspended his account saying that his skills weren't good enough! what the.. that's disgusting, no support for freelancers, my partner is a graphic design student and charged bugger all for jobs he just didn't get contracted to some because he aimed too high, if he knew up work would do this he never would have applied for high skill jobs even though he actually is highly skilled just didn't have enough proof, this website is a disgusting discriminating piece of work! very angry.",0
"I wrote a review about their unintuitive website and missing phone contact. They are threatening to close my account instead of improving the website. My crime: I cancelled a duplicate order, while the original order has been completed and paid - how stupid! Dabeer Mallik",0
"These filthy scammers stole my hard earned money. Beware. I strongly advise people not to use this website. They will close your account under any excuse and..

"I've been hiring freelancers for many years with my first full time freelancer in 2007. I've used all of the platforms and really liked Elance before they became (or merged into) Upwork. I can't see Upwork being a good solution for hiring freelancers in long or short term situation unless you just can't find the talent somewhere else. My initial experience after Elance became Upwork was somewhere between horrible and bad but I stuck it out with the hope it would improve. When Upwork completely jacked the pricing up so high that it was no longer even worth it, that was strike 2. I typically got more qualified freelancers through Upwork than others but with the new pricing and absolutely HORRIBLE customer service in the last few months, that is a huge strike 3. Much higher prices with much worse service = I am happy to terminate all work through Upwork and use another service.",0
"WASTE OF TIME! Applied to the site a freelancer - I have 15+ years of experience, and a Master's Degree from a top school, my own consulting firm, etc. Application was rejected as they say there are too many people with my skill set in their system? I'm a digital, general AND brand marketer and have ton of different skills. When I asked for more specific info, like ""do you need analytics skills vs. creative?"" as I have experience across the board, I keep get an auto response with the same message.",0
"As an employer there's many scammers and real bad freelancers, who's making quick money and run. As a freelancer you competing with millions of other freelancers, with no chance to get any work. So either way I wouldn't use this platform.",1
Very bad services and rules without any notices upwork permanent suspended my 6 years old account ($30k+ earned) 5000+ Hours.,0
"I am a technical writer with 20 years experience with some blue chip companies. When I wanted to pull away from the corporate world, I opened an account with Upwork, and began submitting proposals for gigs I was highly qualified to complete successfully. For some reason, I never received a response from the companies that placed the RFQs. It turns out that Upwork has a filter that favors some freelancers, at the expense of others. The criteria is obscure, and seems totally illogical. They did send a few recommendations to me, but they were jobs outside my area of expertise. I mean way outside -- one was in Spanish. The experience was a total waste of time. Stay away. Charles Arnold Happypathcommunications.com",0

"Some months ago, they came out with a rates plan that matches the highest in the market (a 20% commission, as I remember, for $1000 or less contracts/jobs). They are now permanently suspending freelancer accounts stating that the freelancer has sent a ""high number of proposals for jobs on our site without many contracts or earnings"". I am not sure whether this is a good tactic in the long run because they're closing the door for many qualified and genuine freelancers who can offer much variety to the services requested and offered. Instead, they should improve their algorithms for matching freelancers to work or by improving their archaic platform for better searching of services on offer and requested. I've been successful in other popular freelance sites, but here (earned just over a couple of hundred dollars in one year, while most of my earnings came from other sites)--and, it is not a good sign to see fellow freelancers been suspended for what an Upwork employee posted in a discussion board as ""removing non-selling items from the shelf"".",0

"I've started a month ago with this website and at the beginning I was really excited about it and thought they had a really good platform. But the truth is that they are not on the freelancer side...After two bad experiences with clients who I wrote for and who decided to stop the contract because it was not good enough for them and where I had to work for $0, Upwork decided to close my account, accusing me to agree to receive money outside of their system. I never did such a thing. This client Lydia Ross from NLPH Seminars, told me to buy ebooks on Amazon, and that she will repay me for it. So far, I've seen nothing. I also asked her to compensate the 2 days I worked on her project and where she refused to pay me the whole amount. So we agreed on $30, same here nothing so far. You're not the only freelancer platform Upwork and acting this way is not gonna bring you luck, trust me...",0
"They charge high rate of commission and transaction fee extra (20%+0.99%), which is comparing high to other sites. They suspend your account just because client is not choosing you (Nonsense).

"Upwork it the worst platform I have every hired anyone over. My freelancer was cancelled/terminated on the Upwork platform and I was notified after. I spend over $4,110 with this freelancer and now that Upwork terminated him with no notice to be prior, he was not responding to me SO NONE OF MY WORK WAS HANDED OVER to me that I had been paying him a per-hourly rate for. I have been back and forth with upwork and they tell me this is not their responsibility. I told them that since he was hourly paid, he had all the work with him and it needs to be given to me or I want to be refunded by them. Fat chance of that. They also delete all my comments on INSTAGRAM and and BLOCKED my instagram account as they don't want anyone knowing how they operate. Funny, as the comments clients/freelancers write about each other cannot be edited due to the 'honest review' policy. But this doesn't apply to reviews on their own platform in regards to Upwork.",0
"I spend over $25000 on Upwork but when I hire (most Indian) freelancers they where all a disaster. No deadline reached, they lie about the work which is not done to get a payment, they log in for more hours. They drag the project to keep your for long time to benefit the payment. I hired a Indian company who had a good feedback on Upwork. But then I found out they gave my work to students so they can focus on getting more projects. At the end you pay triple the price than developing it in your country. No outsourcing for me anymore. I WILL NEVER EVER USE UPWORK ANYMORE!!!! amsterdam200@hotmail.com for proof",1
"I've read the posts here and all your experiences are the same as mine. They suspended my account just because of a stingy client who reported me by telling him he's stingy. They are just on the client's side. So no matter how hard you explain yours, it will never matter to them because we are just freelancers. Their Help Support is NEVER a HELP because they are all one sided. They don't give you another chance because ONE MISTAKE you make will MAKE YOUR ACCOUNT BE SUSPENDED. This is totally insane. Another thing is the 20% deduction from our salary. How come they've come up with that? We are the ones working, not sleeping just to work, and Upwork is getting that percent from our earnings! I don't know if there is a way to FILE A LAWSUIT to this company but I am hoping that one day, Upwork will be down and just be gone so the new CEO and his cohorts will regret all their unfair treatment and abuse to us freelancers. I am really hoping and praying for that to happen. I hope someone will start something for the LAWSUIT.",0
The freelancers consistently charge more than agreed- there is a lot of fraud and bad work on this site. DO NOT USE IT,1
"I got lucky the 1st 2 people I hired so I was not expecting any problems. 2 of the next 4 people I hired were blatant scams who just ran the meter over night and did not provide anything like what I asked for. I tried to freeze the payment but because they had a work diary, easily faked, Upwork sided with them. They have also failed to correct any technical issues like rooms that won't close and blocked people who can still message me. What I find most interesting is that I gave up and closed my case threads almost 30 days ago. Yet there is always recent activity on them even though there is no messages or any views by me. I notice the most recent one, closed about 24 days ago, was viewed about 15 minutes ago. It must be a source of never ending entertainment for them to still be looking at it after all this time. They are to stupid to realize they have just seriously cost themselves much of my future business. I am only dealing with the current people I am happy with and not even going to be doing any new projects through that site. Hope it was worth it for the bit they did get.",1
"I completely agree it's not good to work. Not sure why some people not agree but there are plenty of guys who had bad experience. And very few get advantage from upwork especially buyer. They nowadays request profile verification for every new freelancer who is going to get in this website while theres no other website which is doing this. Furthermore, they reject the profile submit when first income to the upwork by saying they dont have enough place to work because already sufficient developers in those skill category. This will be very frustrating for newbies who wants to start business by relying on them. If someone cannot believe, just try it. Its very simple. Once you passed that after 9~10 times of failure, it will close your account unless you get a new job within 2 months which you will have only 20~30 chance to apply to new job in each month which will very few opportunities for newbies. For succeeded one who had hardly get at least $10 job, they immediately require video call verification which is all ok for me but something like I did criminal thing. Actually, there are no other sites are doing like this at least for freelancing area. When you success all this thing and continue work on website, when problem happens like client complaints you or disputed, they will suspend your financial account and sometimes revers all transaction you get earned by working even though you have significant work evidence and earned with your all burning effort. When you request to their support why this is happens, they says, because of your suspicious activity or because of terms of condition or privacy policy and not stating the exact reason. When you are complaint about this when you are 100% right, then they are answering as they have some bugs on their system.(Rare case of course but if you cant believe, just try it). Sometimes buyers are managing freelancers by threatening to giving 1 star rating even did good works which is definitely your effort is higher than 1 star rating but they are saying its freedom for buyers to left feedback according to their experience which is completely true. But in freelancer points of view, 1 star rating is definitely not good for future work award and even more, it doesnt affect anything if freelancer gives 1 star rating to client. So many of freelancers do some more free work to get account reinstated or 5 star rating for future work and it will make you like slavery to clients. Of course this all can be avoided if someone liked to be suspended and get 1 star rating and finish this website, whats the matter?",0
"If you do not know it by now let me repeat the settled facts about Upwork: 1. Their support staff are Middle Eastern guys working out of their basements. 2. They REALLY don't give a f*ck about freelancers, other than taking 20% of your earnings. 3. They have a things called JSS (Job Success Score) which is beyond idiotic, doesn't work and basically allocates you a random number/ percentage to indicate quality of work. For example: You can get 5 star reviews from all your jobs and have a JSS of 60% (!) How? DO NOT ASK! These idiot f*ckheads are so full of their own sh*t that questioning the JSS is like drawing cartoons of the prophet Mohamed in their books - THOU SHALT NOT QUESTION THE CRAP KNOWN AS JSS! 4. If there is a dispute between you and a 'client' (Their genius way of referring to scammers from various countries) you are f*cked! They only care about the numbers and Upwork knows that the average pissed off 'client' hurts their business more than the average pissed off freelancer. There are far better freelancing websites out there - I predict a class action lawsuit against Upwork very soon the way they are ignoring the complaints of freelancers getting ripped off on their platform.",0
"I tried Upworks for several weeks. I am a highly experienced editor and proofreader. Out of probably 50 'bids' (I stopped after that) - which are a huge time consumer - I only received 2 invitations to interview. One was a scam, and the other requested a phone interview but never responded when I asked him to set up a time. How can ANYONE expect to make any money on this site? I applied for jobs asking for 'experts' but then stated they were looking for the lowest paying freelancers. Yeah- you don't get both. I can't believe that EVERY SINGLE job I bid for had lowest bid of $3-$4. Who the hell would work for that? I never bid anything less than I was worth (for a home position). Still searching for legitimate home work. Freelancer.com was even worse - non-stop 'invites' from companies in Nigeria, etc. I accidentally hit 'accept' on one, and Freelancer charged my account $60. Luckily, I had no credit card on file. Steer clear of these sites unless you want to waste hours writing bids from jobs you'll never get.",0
"My Account has been suspended without telling any reason, I have created dummy account which is not even activated. I got a message from the support team you have created multiple accounts its violation of policy, to another close within 14 days, but they have suspended both accounts without giving the grace to close the dummy account. It is not professional, I have dropped an email to CEO, SKasriel@upwork.com, and VP of Operations Etse@upwork.com, this stupid CEO suspended my accounts. This is something against their policy, they should give the grace to close the other account, if I am tried to close the account, it is not successful, a message notifies like your account not able to close because it is suspended. I have a solid reason against Up work. I have been using more than 1 years, this is the way they treat Freelance. I will sue this company to lodged a legal complaint against this firm for cheated me my project money. The project has been completed.  Also, it will publish in all social media and News channel, Government of United State. Request to all Freelancer, please spread this information over the world to Ban this fraud company. Thanks.",0

REALLY ?? ARE YOU KIDDING ME ??? IS THIS A JOKE ? I came back after such a long time and used 15 CONNECTS AND YOU SUSPEND ME.... I wrote back to them review my profile manually , they sent me some auto-boot emails asking me for lots of information and told me they will review my profile...I wrote them back with details and they within 20 minutes later replied me that we reviewed your profile and we're staying on our decision and we will not change this. its like that they had already decided to screw me up because you cant manually review a profile manually within 10/20 minutes and tell me a very important decision. a profile which has a history of a bunch of projects which were done years ago.",0

By theirs own rules, I have to use theirs private messages and not email or Skype to communicate with freelancers, and now they say that I use too much messages... are they crazy? I could not to contact people and pay them money, so near 100 freelancers didn't receive theirs money because of upwork crazy rules.

"This site: -claims that it's there to help freelancers and clients hook up with each other, and offers escrow protection to make sure payments are fair. However: - if a client gives you a bad review, it doesn't matter who's in the right or the wrong; your account will be damaged, and your business will look bad, for months. Again, all it takes is one upset client. Do you really want to pay 20% of all you earn in order to work on a website that has rated you terribly in the public eye? I mean, who hasn't gotten one or two grumpy, impossible-to-work-with clients at one time or another? - scammers galore use this site, and Upwork does little to nothing to filter them out from the real clients. Moreover, if you accidently get scammed, it's you that Upwork threatens to sue, not the scammer. You could get ruined by this site. - their site is CONSTANTLY being ""fixed"". The technical difficulties they experience as a matter of course are huge and never-ending. My computer is sometimes unusable due to messages from Upwork that won't disappear from the screen and cover one third of the screen, no matter how often I shut down and restart my computer. - payments are grossly, unfairly, low. You're competing with people who can, and do, work for $5 a day. That's not Upwork's fault, but it is what happens when a site is global, and unfortunately, finding fair work on Upwork is just about impossible from a freelancer's point of view. - Clients have you over a fire, and Upwork won't protect you from it. Say a client wants you to write 5 articles for them, but only wants to pay you for 1. The client simply ""changes his mind"" about the template and the topic each time you submit the article, saying that what you wrote wasn't good enough, but that he'll give you another chance if you actually write about this totally different topic instead. What do you do? To refuse means to get a 1 star rating and a bad review that you can do nothing about, but which will harm your business for the next 6 months. You HAVE to comply with this dishonest client, working for 5 days for him for the price of 1 day. Otherwise down goes your Upwork rating and your future potential business vanishes! - Unfortunately, I found the other freelancers are sometimes dishonest too. This means that clients can be extremely jumpy, ready to give you 1 star ratings that actually the freelancer who worked before you deserves. That means that your advertising, online image, and profile can get damaged because of another freelancer's dishonesty. I wish that I had never worked on Upwork. The longer I worked on it, the lower and lower it went down in my opinion.",0
"I thought of trying it since I would love to work from home and manage my time, I did send some proposals, lowering my hourly fee, but it seems that people here are cheepos trying to hire at 3-5$/hr for professional jobs, seriously, (like: send me your portfolio of Villas and Luxury Condos so I can pay you 5$/hr!) definitely think the site should set the minimum at least by law of hourly employment: to TOP it all I did receive one proposal (from which I think is a real Company) and I am pretty sure it was a SCAM, it invited me to Interview on Chat on Googlehangout, I was supposed to be trained by them (Paid for it too) and then start, they wanted to send me a check so I could buy software for training (weird, not giving you my address) But could not give or send me more info by email on the job and it was very very vague. Anyways, PROS OF THE WORLD if you keep accepting 3/5 $/hour you are enabling these cheepos, I get it that in some parts of the world you can feed a family with that pay but these employers often are not from those parts of the World! If those who decide to stay there start accepting ONLY jobs for at least 30$/hr I assure that the cheapos will have no choice but to to pay that!",0
"I was a newbie and had gotten tired of looking for freelance work that wasn't a scam, but then I was reading about upwork sites kept recommending them as legit .The past two weeks I have wasted time interviewing with so called HR people on Google hangouts. one company claimed to be City Group bd which means in Bangladesh. The other claimed to be located in Turkey.I gave it the benefit of the doubt because I thought maybe a global company could be on the site,but no they wanted my online banking id an password and when I said no .They said it was necessary for the job.I told them they could pay via PayPal ,or through the site they tried to press the issue .They still tried to convince me to complete the fake orientation tasks ..I actually had to do alot of research to finish the tasks before I realized that this is B.S. I have since deleted the upwork app an not looking back.I contact their feedback support and let them know also I told them I would just take my chances freelancing on Craigslist at this point.I will now just go back to my original plan of starting a business. I just hate I took this detour trying to find work from home jobs.",0
I have not violation any rules issues by work but my upwork account suspended due to submitted proposals for jobs. Freelancing work is the part of sending proposals and Upwork suspended my account for sending proposals; What a non-sense decision from upwork. Really BAD and POOR decision from upwork. Also I am not able to withdraw my money(USD $380) from upwork account to my bank. Guys beware about upwork fraud. Please do not use this site/company. This is Fraud and Scam company. I will report to FBI and upwork will suspend. Please contact here to report FBI: https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/www.upwork.com#299 Upwork name will be Downwork.,0
At any moment they closed my account for verification. After passed verification could not import my profile from elance.com. After i put 5-6 bids they decided again to close my account - had not picked after 5-6 bids. Arrogant and greedy managers,0
"I've been using upwork for years now. But man, 20% ripoff is insane! Just imagine how much you would earn on a $100 project? $80? That's crazy $20 man. People are now leaving and moving to other freelancer site. They shouldn't have done this in the first place. http://video-to-mp3.org",0
"I had heard that the customer service on this site was terrible, and really just unnecessarily rude, but for some reason I had to see if for myself. I started a profile, and wasn't really prepared to do it all in one sitting - I wanted to spend a couple days perfecting it. The first night after creating the profile (and before even attempting to get any gigs) I get this long drawn out and really just cold and rude email detailing all the UPWORK POLICIES I was violating with my unfinished profile - really? I haven't even finished it yet! Needless to say I deleted the account - I can't even imagine what's its like trying to handle a problem with these people. Also - didn't receive any sort of ""sad to see you go"" email or any attempt to figure out why I canceled. They were just like SEE YA",0
"I wasted 2 weeks working with a fraudulent freelancer on Upwork.com I didn't notice until after he got nearly $1500 out of me. Just 1 day he disappeared and stop responding to my messages. Worst thing about it is that Upwork refused to refund the money! No worries, I just called my bank to handle it but now I'm behind schedule and need to find a reputable freelancer to create my project. Beware of these scam artist, they are everywhere!",1
"I spent many hours completing my Upwork profile, took tests to show my skills in subjects I have studied and developed expertise in and then found out my account was suspended and I needed to verify my identification. I did so with a video call. After this, my account was re-activated only to find out that days later it would be suspended again. There was no warning or reasoning behind this decision. I responded through an appeal with copies of all three of my diploma certificates. Their decision was final with no explanation. It was a complete waste of my time setting up my profile and trying to establish myself through their network.",0
"This is seriously unfair and wrong part from their side. I wasted my precious time to build my profile, taking tests and without any fault from my side they suspended my account, I only submitted proposals to offers that I know I can do only, and upwork basically say ""your fault that you didn't get chosen so piss off"". Also they rejected my appeal after giving them all proofs, attached copies of relevant documents (diplomas, certificates, etc.) that verify that education, skill or experience. To be honest, I am very disappointed and frustrated from this decision. Also become a big hater of Upwork from now.",0
"I've been using upwork for almost a year now, and got a pretty big project as my first freelance job, I finished the job and the client was happy. And as I am in the process of getting 2 more possible work, they suspended my account stating that I sent too many proposals without enough winning results. Luckily I still managed to withdraw my earnings and arrived at my bank account. It is like saying that, ""you suck, so die and give up trying"", to be honest I only submit proposals to offers that I know I can do only, and upwork basically say ""your fault that you didn't get chosen so piss off"". And the rejected my appeal. Post a complaint on their FB page, and was removed withing few hours. Someone else's post also got removed for similar complaint. And now they set their FB page so nobody can post anything. Terribly disappointed.",0

"Totally new to Upwork. I was looking to pick up some projects while I had some down time between some of my regular client work. I'm STUNNED at how little these clients are willing to pay!

They just invited me for an interview on UPWORK. They interviewed me without showing herself and without speaking, just on chat. And I am the one that is showing myself. I became suspicious in her identity. After the interview she ask me to picture on a whole body so I do it. But after that she said for me to wait because she got a call, so I got even more suspicious on her. PLEASE HELP ME ABOUT THIS. Here is her skype id: jessica.smith.9955",0
they approve payment to freelancer without my approval and the freelancer did not do the job nicely. And the help center asking me to pay 290usd to help me to get the money back. i hate their help center. IF you going to use upwork do not pay dispute money without the job complete so they can not steal your money. Guys use separate credit card for the payments just use the exact amount.,1
My husband and I decided to try this Upwork to look for a freelance job. My husband was lucky enough to get few projects however his account was suspended due to high volume of sending of proposal. He also have a high rating review from a client so we did find it unreasonable for them to suspend the account for this reason. My husband could not even withdraw the money that he has earned because of the minimum withdrawal fee. So I suggest for other freelancer (specially for newbies) who are still thinking of using this website to look for another one. This maybe their way of scamming hard working freelancers by suspending their account with unreasonable reason for you not to be able to get your earned money.,0
"The customer support at UPWORK is terrible. The departments are seperated and the only way you can talk to a real person on upwork with no automated and generic replies, is with the customer support phone line. However, they can only solve problems to a certain extent because the department that handles the REAL problems can only be reached through e-mail. My account was suspended because my client asked if I accepted payment outside of upwork--to which I said no. Who knew that just by ANSWERING that question, it was considered ""discussing"" payments outside of upwork which followed with my account being suspended. When I asked to resolve this, I only got automated and generic replies from upwork. When I tried to talk to customer support on the phone, they told me that they have no way to deal with this since it is not their department and that I can only reach that department through e-mail. I constantly tried to get through to the department so I can have a REAL conversation to try and resolve this matter, but NOPE. Generic copy and pasted replies, instead of someone who genuinely is there to listen and work things out. This little mistep caused my permant suspension and ban from upwork. I would definitely advise people not to use Upwork in general. There are so many ""little"" misteps that are hidden underneath Upwork's agreement. I certaintly did not know that just by replying to a quesiton, it was considered as discussion, which left me with my account being permantly banned and with no one wiling to openly help resolve my case with care.",0
"After letting me post a job, award it, get the guy working on it, they froze the whole account asking for a government issues color id with a picture, birthdate, full address and other identity information, PLUS the full credit card information, all emailed to some unknown person at zendesk that won't even tell me what country they are in or what their last name is. I close the account immediate and am fighting to get the funds which they are not paying to the freelancer either. Real scammers - be careful and do not use them!!! Be Warned.",0
"I was using eLance and was very happy with their service. However, when I was forcefully ""upgraded"" to UpWork, everything went wrong. First, they have no rights for their useless ""freelancer protection service"". This is actually managing escrow and for that financial service license is necessary at least in Europe. And then they must release payments within 48h and not in 6 days. And why should customer make payment before hiring? Normally customer makes payment, when happy with the result, if not agreed differently. And monitoring private conversations under NDA is criminal activity. I have reported it to FBI, but seems, that US authorities are so used to monitor any telecom usage, that they do not even bother to arrest for such kind of crimes.

Nothing was vulgar in my job posting in any way, shape or form..I was seeking an appointment setter for my travel agency. When I tried to open a ticket I kept getting error messages. I then went into the desktop to just close my account altogether to find a message stating that I was unable to close my account until I closed all of my pending proposals with a hyperlink leading me to the proposals page... ostensibly. The proposals page only crashed and burned. I then tried to reach back out to support to determine how to go about cancelling the pending proposals only to then find out that I cannot even access the Upwork support page..period.

I have been freelancing for over 2 years with clients- not through a website. I tried this out. It's is by far the worst way to go. Clients: find your freelancers by posting jobs on craigslist/indeed/design sites. Not Upwork. Freelancers: find your clients somewhere else. Upwork is BAD.,0
"I, THE HIRING CLIENT, TRANSFERRED MONEY TO UPWORK'S SO-CALLED ""ESCROW"" IN ORDER TO PAY MY FREELANCER FOR THE JOB DONE, BUT.... UPWORK NEITHER PAID THE FREELANCER, NOR INTENDS TO RETURN MY MONEY BACK TO ME. I needed a freelancer to translate some documents for me, and tried to find one on Upwork.com After uploading the money for the job to Upwork's escrow, my account got ""disabled"", while I started to receive numerous and insistent requests from Upwork to send copies of my personal IDs. I knew from before, that almost all employees at Upwork are hired from India, Pakistan and other South Asian countries (most of the programming work and customer support takes place in those countries; this corresponds well to the fact that at least 95% of all the freelancers in Upwork are also from South Asia). Therefore, for me it was out of the question to send copies of my ID to a private company, where it could be accessed and misused by the frequently rotating staff, consisting of hundreds Indian, Pakistani and other nationals. Nobody would want to have their IDs copied, forged, and then used in human trafficking, illegal immigration, financial frauds or scams, other types of crimes or even in terrorism. After I refused to send copies of my IDs, and asked them to either release the money to my freelancer for the job done, or to refund the money back to the credit card, Upwork's so-called ""Customer Support"" did not do that. Each of my emails with a request either to pay the freelancer, or to return the money, they replied to by pasting in the same canned request to send copies of my ID, together with false statements that ""I must"" send my ID when requested. I don't know much about laws in US, but the legislation of my country Sweden, as well as of EU (which Sweden is a part of), says that no private company can demand private persons to send copies of their private, sensitive IDs. Private companies can ask, but they have no legal right to demand. The only thing private companies can do, is to refuse to sell services or products. However, for me, living in Sweden/EU, and being subject of Sweden's and EU jurisdictions, Upwork's third-world employees (all disguised by western names, but still writing in the typical ""Indian/Pakistani English""), stated that ""I must"" send my ID to them. Such falsely statements are a subject for legal suit against this company. As per today, my money (a few hundred dollars) have not been refunded, despite my numerous requests and demands. People behind Upwork clearly have a policy of keeping the money to themselves on the excuse of ""routinely control"" and ""freezing"" users' accounts, hoping that the users will get tired and leave their money to Upwork. By now I am quite sure that I will never see the money again. However, I do intend to draw these scammers into the daylight. The next Monday a police report will be filed on the grounds of money scam, and a legal suit will follow. Furthermore - one could be a little confused, seeing this many positive ratings of Upwork on Trustpilot. However, there is a simple explanation of it. Since I work with IT, I have had experience with many other freelancing and other businesses, many of which, just like Upwork, too have outsourced their operations to India, Pakistan and other poor South Asian countries. Such companies, in order to battle with the high number negative reviews, engage their own employees to put in positive reviews. In this case, Upwork has done a remarkable job. But this only can fool someone, who doesn't know how these scam-based ""companies"" operate. What is the real ratio of positive/negative reviews of Upwork, one can see on Yelp dot com, and here on Sitejabber (I do understand it's difficult for Upwork to hold track of, and try to fake the positive reviews on all the websites full of their victims' complaints). Now, at least, you now a little bit more about the company with a notable name ""Upwork Global Inc."", and that you will think twice before uploading your money to this scam company. To be continued.",0
"I had an amazing experience in Elance, jobs were easy to browse based on clients background and number of proposals submitted and also I used to get invites from which i bagged many projects! BUT UPWORK IS TOTAL $#*!, the whole user interface for freelancer is mundane, you really dont have much option to browse though the jobs you fit in, and the fee structure is a total fraud, if you get work of $100, you only get paid $60 and on top of it, the minimum job rate are literally minimum, atleast ELANCE had a bar of $20. In ELANCE for abt 3 months and made almost $2k working part time, however ever since this UPWORK $#*! happened i am busting my a** on regular basis and i have been awarded ZERO jobs!!",0

"Upwork cheats people out of their money. Some freelancers worked for me, I was generally happy with the work and was ready to pay. Upwork suspended my account and the accounts of my freelancers and after 4 days, still have not told me why. Although I proved that I had access to the account I was paying from, by verifying two random deposits, they continued to request for more and more personally identifiable information. As I type this, my account is suspended. They did however, managed to open it long enough, to take the money that belongs to my freelancers out of my account. Those freelancers, haven't received their money, and their accounts are still suspended. Upwork's story to the freelancers is that they refunded my money but I haven't seen any evidence of the refund. If this is not fraud, I don't know what is!",0
I hired a Freelancer whom didn't do his job- I disputed with upworks . Upworks wants to charge me $275 to dispute. Upwork is scam their freelancers are scam too,1
A complete scam site. Freelancers claim to be able to complete work they can't do and they get paid even when they don't deliver! It's impossible to remove sensitive data like credit card details when you try to close the account! Don't use ever!!!!!!,1
"First off let me say this. I was a long time freelancer on Elance and then was moved to Upwork when they merged. I held a 98% Success score for years, I was on their Enterprise Bench - which you don't know what that is you have to be invited by Upwork to be on. I was an elite freelancer and only had 1 bad review in 6 years, and even that one was edited by Upwork because they felt it wasn't fair. That being said, as an elite user, I had a direct line (phone) to their customer service. Over the course of this year (2017) I discovered, from the inside as an elite user, that two main features of Upwork are NOT what Upwork says they are. The first feature is the Time Tracker they claim protects freelancers and clients alike. It does not work. It will cut itself off at random. When it does, all a freelancer can do is enter the missing time manually. As soon as you do that, you are no longer protected. All guarantees are null and void. I had tickets open to address the problem for months, Upwork never fixed the problem. They know the problem exists, but has never corrected it. The second is the JSS (or Job Success Score). This ""secret"" algorithm is supposed to show a freelancers or clients success rate. It doesn't work at all. It's complete crap and a lie Upwork uses to draw in new freelancers and clients alike. For example, if a client leaves a contract open assuming they will have work later on, Upwork claims that is ""Neutral"" and does not affect your score. That is a lie, it does drop your JSS score. Any feedback given by a client to a freelancer that criticizes Upwork in anyway will be edited by Upwork. And vice versus. My score in particular dropped from 98% to 88% because of contracts that were open, but had not been active for a few weeks. That doesn't mean the clients or myself did anything wrong or negative and we should not have been penalized. We were. For a company that takes 20% of any job and monthly subscriptions, these two features should have worked properly. They do not. In my case, Upwork was making easily $600 to $800 a month off of me. For that much money a month, EVERYTHING should work. Yet Upwork knows and has not corrected either of these problems. In addition, the customer service completely sucks. They do not abide by their own Terms of Service. They routinely ban both clients and freelancers for raising these issues. They edit feedback, forums, anything that criticizes Upwork as a company. So at the end of the day, you are paying for nothing. The reviews are edited, the scores are not accurate at all, the guarantees are worthless, nothing on that site is true. If you are a freelancer, you will be exploited. If you are a client, you will be lied to. Period. In my opinion, this site should be hit with a class action lawsuit and forced to return every dime it has ripped off from clients and freelancers. And that's coming from me, one of their chosen elite.",0
The service is awfull I cannot get hold of anyone at all. I wish they would look after people alot more. I have however stumbled on a much better service called goworkers. www.go-workers.co.uk,0
I have had great success with similar platforms over many years so thought I would try Upwork. The developer ignored my entire requirements and just produced a single page that was more limited than our mock-up page. He managed to get me to pay half up front though and was demanding the rest! I tried to contact upwork about it and they passed it off to some other company for arbitration. They didn't respond for weeks and then asked a few obvious questions and then never showed up again. I cannot even leave a review on the project to warn others! They don't care since they are holding my funds!!! This is a total scam! When I contact them they say they have too many claims to keep up with them so they cannot do anything!!!,1
"It's impossible to make nice extra income let alone make a living via upwork. The competition is truly unhealthy. People pay you like crap. For example, many people advertise to pay only $30 for original English content for 8 pages, 2000 words each. How crazy is that!",0
"A freelancer got my money there without delivering the job. I asked them to stop releasing money to him. They told we can't. That easy, you can go to this website, as a client to release a first milestone to you and then you ca run away without any probem. Their supports are sucks.",1
"I have submitted three emails to the Upwork staff regarding an email they sent me that had errors in it on their end. Every. Single. Email. EVERY ONE of them I got an instant email back with the same generic ""we can't accept you because there isn't demand for it."" Meanwhile, more than 1,600+ jobs are sitting wide open, ready for people who are willing and able to work to get clients projects completed. What gets me is that they already had the information from me as to what my skill sets were (for which I am evidently being denied) - before I even was required to put in my personal details, such as my workplace, physical address, and phone number. So now, not only does this company have my information - they won't even consider allowing me to apply for jobs with them. Stay the heck away from this company. Please. I wanted to have faith in this company, but their automatic system is murdering them.",0
"Right off the bat I knew there was a problem with the testing. First exam I got 4.5/5 and there was NO WAY I missed any question-- 40 for 40 spot on. I ask them to SEE the questions I ""answered wrong"" Oh we don't administer the test. So I go and find out--on my own, that ExpeRating does the tests. It took forever to get to a live person, and their response was--the test questions follow what we teach IN OUR COURSE--forget if they are right or not--and YOU can PAY to take our course. I am so outta here! MENSA, PHI BETA KAPPA obtw.",0
"All was going well on Upwork, until a customer actually suggested working outside of the platform, I did not accept; however asked him further questions about the idea. Two days later I had my account terminated! What's worse is that the client only received a warning! I sent several pleas to Upwork all of which received a copy+paste response. So my livelihood destroyed with no warning or investigation!",0
"I find this intriguing to say the least! I closed my account within one hour simply because of a typo. Yes, thats righta typo. You see, when you begin the sign up process with Upwork, if you make a mistake on your real name, you cant go back that one step and fix it, as you are caught in a loop of the process. I didnt think much of it, figuring that I could always go back and edit my typo in my nameI typed Micahel, reversing the a and the h. Guess what? Couldnt be done! I searched and searched and tried to find a customer service CONTACT form or emailno such luck. So after spending a ridiculous amount of time that on any other LEGIT site (like freelancer) would have taken 30 seconds, I decided that if they cant provide me with a contact method, I dont need them, because what if I have issues with a client? After reading ALL the MASSIVE number of complaints here, I know I made the RIGHT decision.",0
And I will not rest until they do the right thing... Can someone please give me some advice? Thanks M. Hall,0
"After working as a freelancer on Upwork and receiving outstanding reviews, I was unlucky enough to accept a contract with one shady company, AWI MEDIA, they are supposedly based in the UK (they are actually based in Dubai). After trying to pay me absolute crap money I decided to finish up the contract with them and politely told them I would be finishing up with them. They didn't take kindly to this and so decided to leave abhorrent feedback on my record after abusing my through messages, which they promptly deleted. I reported the abuse to Upwork and was advised that because they had deleted their abusive message that the Upwork admin couldn't read it and therefore couldn't take action. I found this to be quite unbelievable that they have no control over seeing what has been posted on their site!!! I find it more believable that they can read it but they choose not to take action against the perpetrator. Obviously I won't be using their site any more. They either don't care or are powerless to ensure that clients are doing the right thing by freelancers.",0
The people running Upwork discriminate against veterans.,0
"I am being treated horribly by Upwork on their Facebook site as well as support. No one helps me with what I need help with, especially when a client lied so they wouldn't have to pay me. And now their Facebook site keeps deleting my posts because I'm speaking the truth. Such a shame. I'm telling all my friends not to join this site for freelance.",0
"There is NO LOGIC of paying 100$ as a fee for a total 500$ project. Also, they charge another 2.75% processing fee from your client when client pay you. Upwork totally sucks. I just write an article which will help freelancer to avoid Upwork fee: ""How to Avoid 20% + 2.75% Upwork fees?"" http://101authority.com/how-to-save-20-percent-upwork-fee/",0
"Now they have increased their fees to 20% up to $500 which is insane, but offers have only decreased. They also added 3% fee to clients... Clients are increasingly stingy, and since I have no intention of working for UpWork I will limit my time spent on any flat fee project to whatever I am getting paid, not any portion going to UpWork. I'm a licensed attorney and have found good clients on Odesk previously, which was a great site, however now its dried up into a desert, and they have the nerve to rip us off more and more. I attempt to remove all clients from the site asap so I can charge what I'm worth.",0
"I've freelanced a long time. In recent years I've made 50% to 75% of my income through elance. During its transition to Upwork, I was working on a long-term on-site job with an ad agency, so I only started attempting to use Upwork in May 2016. What a shock. My history at elance was improperly transferred. It includes only a tiny fraction of my elance history - and it publicly displays earnings, against my will. I can't find a way to fix these problems. Upwork is balky and crashes my browser. It produces script errors. Sometimes it just hangs - requiring me to fill out a form again. And the job quality is horrendous! Where have the elance clients gone? The type of jobs and budgets I routinely encountered at elance are nowhere to be seen. Upwork job postings are often incoherent. Budgets are insulting, most of them impossibly low and completely unacceptable. $50 for a five minute animated video (with a link to a Pixar clip and a note that it must 'look like this quality')? $5 for an illustrated children's book? These job postings are insane and I find it hard to believe these projects are ever eventually produced at the stated budgets. How am I supposed to become a 'rising star' with a 'job completion rating' if every bid I post is ignored? The same type of bids created active engagement and resulted in frequent jobs at elance. What is it with Upwork's bogus ""tests"" and ""certifications""? None of its tests even have anything to do with the services I provide. The 20% fee per job is beyond the pale. It could be the final nail in Upwork's coffin. I searched for Upwork in the business press. I see it's failing. One fund which invested $15 million in Upwork last year now values its holdings at $7 million - and it says the current projection is for holdings of Upwork to be ""worth nothing"" by the end of 2016. If any company deserves to fail and die, it's Upwork. It's a contemptible, sloppy disgrace and its abominable level of service gives the impression that something shady & odd has happened behind the scenes. The big question is: What will freelancers do once the final large job-posting site is gone? Of course, Upwork is so bad it's as if that's already happened. I hate what Upwork has done to my income and the online freelance job market.",0
"I don't trust this company anymore, they forfeited my 1 month salary due to their suspecting me of using auto clicker which is not true and they won't like to hear my explanation even It appears only 30 mins in my log time but they hold and forfeited all my earnings in the past weeks even It is out in the issue. this company is not trust worthy. You are not safe here",0
This company is simply the worst. I would like all their customers to go to their competitors. Simply expensive.,0
"I have used this site for several freelance projects. I also help clients in my non-profit to start their own businesses and have recommended Upwork to them. Because of this Upwork suspended my account claiming I had multiple accounts. They will not tell me why they think this but listed several of my clients as ""linked."" I explained the situation and asked why they thought this. They are all separate individuals with their own accounts and verified financial accounts. However Upwork still tried to demand copies of driver licenses and bank statements to ""prove"" these were individuals. This is an absolute violation of privacy and completely unreasonable not to mention unnecessary. I will have to find a new site for myself and my many clients to use.",0
"If I could leave less than 1 star, I would in a heartbeat. I freelanced through Upwork when it was still oDesk. At first, as an absolutely green freelancer, it was great. That was until I stopped getting paid on contracts. I was never paid almost 2k for articles completed on a contract run by oDesk themselves. The ""editor"" on the project claimed a portion was plagiarized, in spite of it being in quotations and the source properly cited (as per the instructions on the contract). I wasn't paid for any of the articles I'd submitted for the past month. I learned my lesson at that point, but instead of closing my account then, I just left it, not thinking. Tonight, I tried logging in to delete the account, as I'm currently pursuing other work in the field again (willing to give it another try after 4 years), only to find that I can't close the account. Even when initially working with them, I was disheartened by being passed over on contracts by other freelancers offering 1/10 of the fee that I was, only to be asked by the same client later to edit and fix the poor quality content the first freelancer provided. I'd never work for a site like this again. User be warned.",0
I am very annoyed that they wasted my time. I have almost 30 years of experience but they were concerned with a mean nothing college degree.. whatever been dealing with that BS all mylife.. I certainly don't need to make money for anyone but myself.. that's why I started freelancing anyway- tired of others trying to make money off my skills.,0
"I joined upwork group and searched for jobs. I found a job to get 10000 website URLs with googl scholar search and update in excel file. when i bid the project, i got reply from poster of the request to test my skill by having 50 samples size file. i did it in 30 minutes and uploaded to his mail box. finally he took the file and blocked me. when i contacted upwork helpdesk., the said it is my fault to chose wrong seller, so they cant do anything. seems like there are lot of scam post in the site. Be very careful. dont be busy fools.",0

"I've been working with my team on Elance since 2008. It was not perfect, it even had some major issues, but still we could find clients there, and it worked OK overall. When Elance announced the ""merger"" with oDesk, I didn't think it's going to end that bad. In brief, Upwork is awful. It's terrible. It's annoying. Now I see that Elance was simply perfect compared to what I have to use now. Upwork simply doesn't work: - it has numerous technical and logical issues: so far I reported around 20 bugs (and that's only a part of what I discovered) - it doesn't have proper support for teams, it seems to aim at low-cost individuals and low-budget projects (but on the other hand, it charges 20%(!!!) fee on small projects) - it has a lot of trash projects: it was hard to search through low-budget projects and compete with low-budget low-quality providers even on Elance, and now things got about 5x times worse. Upwork is a low quality marketplace, and I with that: - either Elance gets back - some new marketplace appears, and at least does what Elance did Upwork may remain a sort of a trash can for $5 projects and providers. This is what it does best.",0
"I have been with this company for a year and have yet to have been given a job. I have a bachelors in business, I type 70wpm, I am a writer, editor, proofreader, and I am very knowledgeable with technology (one of the best). I added my experience just in case some one has something smart to say about my education.",0
"Upwork is a totally awful choice for doing freelance work online for two reasons: 1. I have been scammed for every job I had. The client would hire me but never create the contract and therefore expect to get my work for free. So not right. 2. Many challenging jobs I encountered had budgets set as low as $100 (and sometimes $50!), and it looks like they should be worth at least $1000. Suppose you managed to get one of these jobs every week, and multiply the income by 52 (weeks in a year). Your annual salary will never be satisfying. Jobs whose budgets are actually more than $1,000 will have specific qualifications like a 90% job success rate as barriers. I could never bypass them due to the scams. I do not see how you could even make a living off this platform if scams are the norm and the budget of the average project is so low. If you are interested in freelancing online, never consider Upwork.",0
"Since Upwork, Inc bought out Odesk.com, things have been going far south. The site is constantly down and many things do not work at various times of the day. This has been happening for quite sometime and we don't see an end to this. Upwork, Inc has just introduced their new commission policy which costs 20% for the Freelancer to work on the site. This is extremely high compared to all the other websites out there. Upwork, Inc has also had serious issues with their policies which has resulted in account closures, money theft from Freelancers, etc. Please read the most recent complaints (Starting at 2015) at BBB.org : http://www.bbb.org/losangelessiliconvalley/business-reviews/internet-services/upwork-in-mountain-view-ca-213440/complaints You can also view multiple issues from many sites: http://www.yelp.com/biz/upwork-mountain-view-2 https://bestcompany.com/freelance/company/upwork-formally-known-as-odesk/ There has been evidence that Upwork has paid for blog reviews as well as user reviews, especially on TrustPilot.com Any company that does have a review on their facebook page, google social page, pays for blog reviews and constantly trying to hide complaints including on their facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/upwork/?fref=ts (Read thru comments on page and on posts, there is nothing but issues) It's quite clear that Upwork, Inc ( Upwork.com ) is unsafe to use, has unethical business practices/policies, buggy site, and is very expensive.",0

They locked down my account and spent the last week doing nothing but asking us for screen shots of various things(email, the work, etc.) At one point, they started pasting the stock reply into our Zendesk ticket to keep as satisfied. I've given up. I'm very glad I didn't get a chance to bill this client the 1,000$ through the platform, because I'll never get the 50$ back that is already in escrow there. Part of the suspension is the inability to withdraw your money. I think that's why they do it.",0

They need to simply bite the bullet, go after these people and don't get us involved with it or have any payment delays.",0
"I've hired so many people. But what happens is it takes months to find someone good, and a few months later they're gone. You can't find reliable, consistent freelancers. Elance, and upwork are just a marketing company that gives you marketing talk but not results. I was ripped off ($800) by a freelancer. Because I'm not a programmer and I wasn't able to find out that the code wasn't right, I spent months to fill the database... The result is there, the job requirement is there. I'm the one who is right, elance Nor it's upwork didn't do anything about it. And they kept this freelancer there. They didn't allow me to update my 5 star review that I posted for the freelancer. The quality of freelancers is horrible. If you're running a business, and you need things that get results in business then you won't find so many options on those websites. There will always be a hassle. Most of the freelancers are not qualified for a real world job. And most of them are there because they can't get a job for the reason that I mentioned. Plus most of them has attitude. Plus DO NOT BELIEVE the samples. I've caught too many samples were fake. Copies are not written by them, they just claim it. If you hire them, what they will deliver is not even close to the quality level of their samples. Web developers, SEO geniuses are mostly not qualified. They can not deliver results but they will keep you busy and hopeful for awhile. So basically, in most cases, you're paying for keeping yourself busy and hoping for a good results will come. In the end, no results that bring results will come. Examples about results: - Let's say you hired a copywriter for your direct mail project. After you send out the mails you won't get sales. Despite that you liked the copy. Liking a copy doesn't sell in real world. Copywriters there don't have a clue with BRANDING and IDEA.. - SEO will make you hopeful. In the end your ranking, most likely will improve on crap keywords only, that no one search for. There's a great chance that you pages will be blocked by google for using cheating techniques. - Web development. They will make it half way. What I mean by saying that, either the code will need fixings, or they will put you in a wrong direction and couple years later you will end up starting over. The website will be slow. They will keep charging you for ""extra work"" that was actually what they were supposed to do at first place. Let's say you have a car that need body work and paint work. For a car it's easy to know. Since you're not a programmer, you won't know this. With the website developers on those website, they will do paint job first. They they will tell you you need a body work so it will be great. After body work they will say paint job again. By the time you're done, you will know that your car is not allowed to drive or it's not efficient to drive at all. You'll buy a new car... That's what the hell is goping on with web ""development crap"" on those website. Part of they don't really know what they're doing and they do guess work. And some of the freelancers are just evil they deceive you. The worse thing is, after all these are done to you you end up hearing marketing talks from the freelancing websites.... you can't take anyone to court, you can't have the freelancers to fix the obvious bad work. The prices are not low anymore. The prices came to a point that you can hire a local, trustable person or company for 10-30% more if not same level, but headache free.",1

UpWork Is a Scam Freelance Site.,0
"I worked as client for upwork since it was called oDesk, I have had many open contracts for designers, programmers and developers. I tried to work as a freelancer and I managed to win many contracts, but suddenly my account was suspended and all my contracts were suspended too, as result I couldn't force the freelancers that I hired to continue working and I lost a year of working. I called the support team, an old rude American woman who has no authority to do any thing but telling you to hold and ask you then to talk to the support using ticket system. By the way, upwork claims that your earning is protected if you choose to be paid hourly, false, they will suspend your account instead.",0
"I recently used Upwork for my design work and hired a freelancer. Everything went well, I hired them using my Upwork's website, conversed with the freelancer through the website and used Paypal and paid using their system. Everything went smooth. However few weeks later, I wanted to post another job ad and found that my account has been suspended. They requested for information such as, How did I find the freelancer? , How did I interact with the freelancer? , How did I pay ?. The most stupid part is that they have full access to my profile. They can go into my account and clearly see how I did all those things. However as I needed to have my account in working order, I provided all my evidence - snapshots of our conversation, and my job add status stating ""PAID"". They however came back and said simply - Your account has been suspended and will not be reviewed again. What kind of BS is that? So I tried speaking to the 4 of their customer service, whom are clueless and cannot help in any way whatsoever and a manager. They all had the same reply - They dont have any information. They also wouldnt give me their complaints department's details, continuously closed my requests, and one of them even hung up on me. And all I was asking for was a VALID reason as to why they would close a paying customer's account? There are so many of these sites out there and better ones too. So with the increased competition in the market, it doesnt seem sensible to be going around closing paying customer's account. If there was an option to for a 0 star, that is what I would give them. 1 star seems TOO high.",0
"Offers nothing special to freelancers and doubles their fees. Does nothing to support small freelancers or prevent its freelancers from being scammed. Don't post your bad reviews on their forums, they just delete them.",0
"I was a freelancer using Elance before the merge with Odesk and Upwork was created. I had no issues with Elance and felt their rates were high, but I dealt with it. They had a lot of opportunities for gigs and I made good money on the site for about a year. Then the merge took place and the policies and procedures made no sense. Upwork has no clue of what life as a freelancer is like. It takes one to two weeks to get paid for a job, even if the client put money in escrow when the job was started. The setup of the site is much more confusing than Elance and not user friendly at all. I will search for work and only a handful of the 3,000 jobs listed will show up for that category. Now they implemented new rates for freelancers, as you pay 20% for the first $500 made with a client, which is up from 10%! Then they charge the client an extra 2.75% now, so they are making an additional 12.75% on each job accepted on the site! However, if you make over $500 with one client, the rate goes down to 10% and if you make over $10,000 with one client than it goes down to 5%. Most clients on the site are looking to pay the least amount possible, so getting to $500 with one client would be hard with the new setup. It was clear to me once the merge happened that Upwork was looking to make as much money as possible with keeping the money on hold for almost two weeks. This new increase in the percentages confirms that and I will not be using Upwork ever again.",0
"I will absolutely not be using UpWork again after the terrible experience I had. The client who had clearly scammed me and refused to pay for the work I had finished well before the deadline was credited back his money (he had only deposited $0.01 into escrow because he clearly knew he would be scamming the freelancer) after I filed a dispute with UpWork. They claimed the dispute was closed because each of us was credited the amount in escrow and I don't think my review of him is showing up now to warn others that he is a scammer! UpWork has no problem with allowing others to be cheated out of their labor after knowing full well what he did to me (and probably others). This is unconscionable, I am absolutely disgusted with this site. Please don't fall for their shady practices!",0
"I was forced to use UpWork do to its acquisition of Elance. I loved how Elance worked. It needed improvements like any platform, but they made changes and had a clean user interface. They were fair to their buyers and from a freelancer standpoint, the fees were ok. I've heard a bit high at times. However, upwork is awful. It's hard to work efficiently in their system. Finding qualified freelancers is hard. Management of a project is difficult because of their workflow. They do not respond to feedback or support requests. I have had unacknowledged support requests that have gone on for months. Now they are charging ""buyers"" a fee to use their service, and they raised the prices on freelancers. I have a few jobs left on there because of the loop in from Elance to upwork, but I will not be keeping my hiring freelancer services on their platform. Especially, with the addition of fees.",0

Really? Legally and in all sort of dimensions this is POOR business. And Upworks customer service is incompetent, their offices - no one seems to exist or answer phones.

When jobs are delivered by freelancers in a quick and timely manner, they are made to wait for days, sometimes weeks, to get paid.

"Those of us who went from Elance to Upwork need no catalog of Upwork's malfeasance. We need to join together to resurrect Elance, or something like it. Upwork must die.",0
"Upwork has been on a MASSIVE downhill slide since oDesk. they no longer handling their own dispute system (they are outsourcing it to some inattentive company called modira). Fraud charges on my paypal account are up from the new lower class of workers and when you dispute the charge with paypal, upwork tells them they are handling it.. Instead, your dispute gets lost in a slow support system called MODIRA which is outsourced as well it's BAD. 90% of of the jobs go wrong and support handles maybe 5% of the disputes! This isn't just an issue of crap work. They don't care about either the freelancer or the job poster.",0
"please do not use this website, is the worse nightmare. bad customer service, over a week with a issue. this people would tell you pay me by hour so they spend incredible amount of hours working in something would take less that 1 hour, i paid for 50 hours, the person told me that they were going to make my website, I stopped the work because after billing me for 50 hours the only thing they did is send me a template and change 5 picture in the template, and that was their work, after 2 weeks, my website got not changes and they are refusing to issue a refund.",1
Stay away from these freelancers: Modern Developers who is Navneet Kaur and Mahesh Salunkhe! Upwork does not do any background checks on these guys and they jump platforms to stay avoidable.,1
"i have been working on upwork since 2011 and was one of the top frelancers on upwork, i got hired by a client for a very small amount of $50 and i completed the job in time, and got the money in my account, later i got an email that my financial transaction has been limited, i contacted the support and followed their instruction and my case was handeled by ""Nel"" he asked for the emails comunication screenshot and the work done by me. I submitted all the screenshots and they asked me to wait and continue working, i continued working and in the meantime other 2 clients also paid me $50 each and days passed by no one replyed I patiantly waited for their asnwer and one day i got a message that the case has been resolved, i replyed asking how and why my account not resumed no one answered, the few days after i got a message from someone else by the name of""eric"" that my account was suspended permanently. They confiscated all the money not only by that client but from other clients too who are working with me for years. Please help. Thanks Sumit",0
"By any scale a WORST COMPANY. This Company's motto is to how to steal your money. As a Client, you will come across Freelancers who will falsely promised you to set a Milestone to have the Project delivered. Then these Freelancers will take your money and will run away. They make false promise and UpWork is completely involved in this Practice. Don't do any business with UpWork",1
"Upwork claims ""clients don't pay until they receive the work and are satisfied with it."". But not at any juncture did they support this claim - I didn't even receive the work from the freelancer much less get an opportunity to determine satisfaction. And yet at no time after I placed my funds into the escrow account was I able to retrieve them nor would Upwork return them to me. The freelancer breached contract, did not deliver any of the work, burned 3 months of my time, still demanded payment and Upwork SUPPORTED THEIR DEMAND. The freelancer's admission of failure to complete AND refusal to continue were captured via instant message within the Upwork site. And still Upwork would not return my funds. I am the only person in the equation who adhered to their user agreement. The only way I got my money back was via a dispute through PayPal as that was my original form of payment, and even that took 45 days. Thank you PayPal. Upwork is clearly just a tech startup looking to build up an illusion of a viable company boasting a large user base so they can sell and disband. Investors beware: do not fall for it. Upwork is a fancy front end with zero substance to back anything up.",1
"I've only gotten a couple of jobs--in three years time. The thing is, sites like Upwork are a race to the bottom. The latest rejection was for a higher-end photographer who wanted to pay $3/image for fairly advanced Photoshop editing, and that's one of the highest rates I've ever seen (when I get feedback, it's from people looking to pay $0.50-$1.00USD/photo.) I won't say who it was or what kind of images it was, but it's the sort of thing that people typically charge a lot more for, and for a session that runs in the thousands of dollars. Well, that's it. I give up. I could make more money on Fiverr, and that's just sad.",0
"We spent almost 2 hours trying to use Upwork to get a project started. Upwork first of all DOES NOT HAVE phone support. THE 24/7 855 phone support is 100% fake and deceitful. You will start as number 7 or 8 and when you get to 1, they will tell you there are no Representatives to support you and to email them instead. If you use the chat function, the reps will provide you with cookie cutter answers to any issues, most being useless. Upwork charged our CC for the amount $2000, then required us to call the bank and get the amounts they charged to our account to verify ownership. After verification, the programmer started working but then UPWork decided to hold his payment and are stating they will release it after several days. Furthermore they did not have any knowledge of the distribution of our private details placed within search engines to raise their search placement (complaints written below). If you read about the complaints on Odesk and Elance you will see that this company is run no differently. The fake 855 number is one tell tale sign of how this company runs their operation. I suggest everyone file a complaint with the BBB, post your experience in forums and online reviews sites.",0
"Beware, Upwork publishes everything you put in your profile, because they don't properly block it from search engines, even if you set your account to private. If you complain they either don't know how, or don't care enough to fix it. And if you close your account it doesn't delete your profile, it just deletes your login information, basically just blocking your own access to your own content, but still allowing it to be found in search engines.",0
"Stay away from Upwork. If ever decide to close your account, they will not delete your information even if you have no projects. They also refuse to provide assistance to remove your information from google search results.",0
"I have spent thousands of dollars on eLance over the last 6 years hiring everything from web developers to graphic designers. eLance worked well. Upwork is an abomination. The site crashes Firefox every time I use it, I don't get emailed messages my freelancers send me, I can't invite the freelancers I want to use, etc. etc. Nor can I post a job that I'm not sure how much it will cost and have freelancers tell me what they will charge. Instead, I have to say what I'm willing to pay in order for the job to be posted. I'm still using Upwork to post jobs and escrow funds for the freelancers I've been working with over an extended period, but we are forced to do all the communications outside of Upwork. There is a tremendous need for a better platform. If eLance can't be brought back, I beg someone to create a better platform!",0
I am having 4 years of exp in freelancing. First upwork suspended my account.for profile picture.Then I uploaded my picture. Second I tried and spend huge time and got 2 scammers and earned 15$ after huge ammount of time. thired upwork supended my account again and they said verify your account. I uploaded the NIC card scan and they again asked me to upload ..... Thank god its not my primary place of work.Wasted enough time.Unhappy,0
"I was interviewed on Skype by a person who got my contact from Upwork. He said he was from a company whose logo is HIPP- Hallmark IELTS Prep Program. He claimed he would give me a job with his website. Subsequently he asked if I knew someone who ""make hjim happy for a week for $500 and then sent a msg from+92-313-750-0304 with a picture of a BJ and it said $500. Does Upwork review job offers? Why does it not have a way to let the company(upwork) know that there are aholes out there who are doing this kind of thing. This was very insulting and has completely turned me off of the website and made me question all online jobs. I would give zero stars if I could.",0
"I'm an employer. I have been an Elance customer for more than a year and spent in excess of $20k, I was forced onto the Upwork platform this week. After noticing Upwork deducting funds from my paypal account without my consent or knowledge I tried to get answers, their listed phone number is an answering machine saying 'this number is no longer in use'. I tried their online chat and got told, they deduct funds every Monday.... and that was that! I removed permission for them to access my paypal account, and cancelled all hourly contracts. I had two fixed price contracts that were already paid in advance, Upwork had all the funds in escrow. Upwork wrote to both freelancers that they had funds in escrow and told them to stop work or they would not be paid. I again asked Upwork to fix this, considering they already had the funds in escrow, their response was, re authorize access to your paypal account and the stop will be lifted. ????? I had already paid the entire contract in advance and they had the funds. They refused to refund the money in escrow, I have had to revert to Paypal to get a refund. NEVER AGAIN will I hire through Upwork.",0
"UPwork is a total rip-off. Two weeks and $160 hours later, I find out that the project my programmer said he can do, is still not fixed and there is no hope that he can fix it. If you value your blood pressure and your wallet, do not use this system...there is a reason they are so cheap...to scam you into using them. Add Upwork to the latest scams on the Internet along with diet fads, and get rich quick schemes...(except for them...they are probably laughing all the way to the bank.)",1
Don't use this website if you are smart!! I shouldve read the reviews before I signed up with this company! They are a joke. Majority of people on this site posting ads are scam artist and or identity thieves! Upwork help and support team is a joke and they don't uphold anything they say in any way shape or form. This site is EXTREMELY UNETHICAL AND THEY ENABLE PEOPLE TO SCREW YOU OVER AND THEY ARE RIGHT ALONG SIDE OF THE SCAMMERS!! DON'T SAY i DIDN'T WARN YOU....GUARANTEED YOU'LL BE HERE WRITING A REVIEW LIKE THIS.,0
"I have spent millions of dollars on ELance. Being forced to leave sucks. I think I will hire someone on Upwork to replace Upwork. It sucks. Running side-by-side searches, upwork does not have as good results. Then they try to sell you 20% fees. and they raise all the other fees from 8 to 10 %.... sucks!",0
They just started (less than a few months) and they already have 50 negative reviews-says everything. They are even worse than Elance which when I think now about it was not that bad. This one is complete bottom.,0
"I am SO glad I did not begin any work at all through Upwork. I was told in the past of their unreputable practices, but I took a chance and created a profile anyway. In the midst of a contract discussion, I informed the client that I was going to contact my bank to confirm the claims Upwork had made regarding payment options and bank policy vs their policy. I decided after a day or two that I really wasn't interested in the contract offered, so returned to the website to decline and found they had suspended my account for ""policy violations"" of attempting to work out offers with clients off the site. That did not happen whatsoever, and I kept all of my emails exchanged with the client - and also informed the client of the accusation and they said they knew nothing about it. It was the only contract on the table, so they are definitely up to something weird. Every freelancer worth their salt knows how to secure their own gigs anyway. Don't bother with this one. You'll likely waste your time!",0
"I've built an excellent reputation on Elance in the Writing and Translation category since early 2009, and used to close about 10% of my bids at decent pay. Generally I was competing against 15-20 others. Now that I've been forced onto the UpWork site, I'm competing against 50-70 others. My hit rate is nowhere, and the few clients I've had advertise for ""Expert"" and then want to pay $2.50/hour. It's a race to the bottom! Technically, the site is beyond bad. Sometimes I receive an invitation to bid. When I respond, the system tells me that I've already applied to that job. Conveniently, there is a link that says ""View Proposal"". It has NEVER worked. So, I do not know what my previous bid was - how embarrassing! My open ticket to a ""high-value"" tech support has brought no solution - just excuses. Now that I've read all these other reviews, I'm ready to throw in the towel with this site.",0
"The way upwork (old odesk - old elance) works is really pathetic. It is like torrents website where content would be posted free. I got a small website work done which was pathetic, so I threw it into trash, and got a fresh work done with a professional company. In a few months, top google search results of my website are actually all upwork, and there atleast 40 freelancers who have put it in their portfolio that they have developed it. I did try to contact elance, and it has given me a big list of forms that I need to fill, FOR EACH OF THE 40, and growing number of links. The forms need proof that the website is mine, from when it is showing, which professional company did it...etc . I did complete it a couple of times, but still they did not take any action to take of the links. Now when I search google for my company name, there are atleast 100 freelancers claiming to have developed my website.",0
"There is no privacy with Upwork. They suspended my account (which had all 5-star ratings) because of a comment in an email stream. Neither I nor the freelancer had spoken to Upwork about this. If it was an infringement of their policy, I don't have a problem with it. But the suspension was done without warning and could only be known by reading the email stream. I don't want my business known by the snoops at corporate headquarters of Upwork.",0
"I had a profile with Elance for several years and had no complaints. I was able to keep my location and my earnings private if I chose to. This isn't the case with Upwork. After a phone call and several postings in the forum, I had made it clear that freelancers have the right to decide whether or not they want to display their earnings and location because this is a personal decision. There are several other freelancers in agreement - and hundreds of complaints in the forums. No change whatsoever. These are privacy violations, and Upwork doesn't care. People are unhappy - they've spoken about this - and Upwork doesn't care.",0
"WARNING to others - Upwork freelancers V T Nezwelt ripped me off $10K and didn't have the qualifications to complete the work despite claiming on Upwork's website that they did - this is the response from Upwork's legal counsel when I asked for help in getting my money back for an end product I can't use: Upwork makes no representations about, and does not guarantee the quality, safety, or legality of, the Freelancer Services; the truth or accuracy of Freelancer's listings on the Site; the qualifications, background, or identities of Users; the ability of Freelancers to deliver the Freelancer Services",0
"I was a top rated freelancer for a long time, until I got a bogus review from an unorganized client. This put me right under the top rated program upwork now has, and I stopped getting views. I contacted customer service, but they were no help as usual. Customer service has always been a joke, and their time tracker has always had ongoing problems. The fee structure needs to be worked on, also. If they listened to the community and upped their minimum of $3/hour, the site would be much better and effective for everyone involved. I left recently and couldn't be happier.",0
"I am disgusted at Upwork. I had been working as a freelancer for three months until a few weeks ago. And after all, they suspended me without any reason. I lost almost $350 overnight. The worst thing is I lost clients with good relationship. I tried to contact Upwork and asked to explain the reason several times, but they answered with silence. Even they refused to explain clients what happened. I am suspicious that Upwork feels lack of money and scams this way sometimes to resolve his economy. If you think you are right, why can't you give me any reason until now? I say again, ""No Upwork Until Forever!!!""",0
"This website is absolutely awful. I must admit the way they set it up isn't bad.It is easy to navigate, but holy crap the freelancers on this website are terrible. I have only done one project on this website and it was a disaster. I asked the first guy I hired to make a cartoon Donald Trump. I thought the design was great until I found out he took the image straight off google images. Then I asked to make a cartoon Hillary Clinton and he absolutely butchered that. It took him for times to actually make the revision I asked for then when I asked to add something he wouldn't do it because he said his design looks more professional. So I fired him. Next I hired someone for the same project and it took 4 days to get any kind of update from him. My work was still not complete. 3 days later still no design. And to top things off the website goes down for at least 2-3 days a week... THIS WEBSITE SUCKS!",1
"I have ample experience with upwork. Here are the major problems with it: 1. Many jobs are listed at slave wages, such as writing 10 articles for 5 dollars, working at $1.20 per hour etc. 2. The Job Success Score with which freelancers are rated is atrocious, hated by all. 3. Upwork wears on its sleeve the fact that it will not listen to its freelancers. 4. The IT is atrocious. I've experienced a glitch with every component of the site... in the last week. It just doesn't work. 5. Customer support is absurd.",0
"Had small job started by freelancer. Was so bad I fired him. He billed me for $80 for time spent working on a project which he never delivered, and for sample work that was so bad I couldn't even use that. Contested with PayPal, which was denied. Disputed with Upwork, which was denied. Beware - PayPal protection absolutely useless and Upwork protection a joke. DO NOT USE. There are others...or you get someone local that understands English and has some degree of ethics.",1
Do not waste your time with this website. It is full of scams and the support center will do absolutely nothing to help you. Avoid at all costs.,0
"What a piece of crap website. Possibly not quite as bad as Freelancer, through which I just suffered an appalling ordeal with a Pakistani woman who addressed me like a piece of $#*! on her shoe andwanted an article written like, the day before yesterday, for 7 measly dollars, and then didn't end up paying me, because I couldn't make amendments as soon as she asked for them because, hey, I have a life and do other things. Anyway, I digress. Upwork's rates are crap, but not that crap. And I signed up in good faith, knowing that I'd have to take on some low-paying jobs in order to build up some sort of ranking, and I was fine with this. Took on a couple of jobs within a couple of days, and worked my socks off to beat deadlines, for low prices. One of my guys was pleased, gave me a bonus, wrote me a stellar review. Other girl was also pleased, and throug these two jobs I amassed something like $80. I work in England, so that's not great for the number of hours, but fine. Then I started getting these emails from Upwork, saying that they suspected dodgy dealings with my clients...but not explaining what these were, due to 'privacy'. They asked for samples of my work, which I sent gladly, hoping that they could get to the bottom of whatever it was. Except, the clients didn't seem to know about the issues when I spoke to them, and so I was left wondering whether it was the clients that I couldn't trust, or Upwork themselves! Next, Upwork started sending me emails asking for me to scan in photo ID and utility bills, again not explaining why, so that I could 'verify' myself? But, surely the texts that I proofread, and the happy customers, was verification enough? Why do they need that sort of information? I asked all these questions, and so far have no answers...and no money. Not sure where I stand legally, but *surely* I shouldn't ahve to give them this information after I've done my part of the deal? Surely there are other ways of verifying?",1
"I joined Upwork about a year ago when my husband was diagnosed with lung cancer, and I decided that working as a freelance editor/proofreader would be a good way for me to earn money and stay at home with him. I completed my first assignment at Upwork two months ago, and the client never paid me, although my work was impeccable. Another client approached me about a job for which I wasn't qualified, and I turned it down. Upwork also kept telling clients that I was not a native English speaker, Not only was I born in New Jersey, but my English is practically flawless. One client wanted a freelancer with lots of experience who would work for minimum wage. Another client wanted me to send THEM money so I could work for them. I sometimes wonder if these jobs and clients really exist. I was forced to return to school in order to become a certified medical transcription editor in order that I might be able to find legitimate freelance work. They should call this site Throw Up Work. When I realized how bogus this site is, I felt like throwing up!",0
"J M's review (""Be careful with these guys"") further down says it all. I don't want to totally put down UpWork. There's still legitimate work there, but it's harder to find, and UpWork simply doesn't care about freelancers. I worked as a freelancer for oDesk for about three years. I had constant work, I was making decent money, and I felt well treated by oDesk. When I had a question or problem, I was treated with respect. It was a good service. That all changed when it became UpWork. The other reviewers who say UpWork doesn't care about freelancers are 100% correct. When it was oDesk, I was a top rated freelancers with a 4.99 rating and I had constant work. After it became UpWork, the rating system changed. At some point I lost my Top Rated status but was never notified about it, then after a while I became Top Rated again, but with absolutely no changes in my status. I wasn't working at all during that period. With oDesk, I always knew how my status was calculated. Under UpWork, it's a mystery. When there were technical problems with oDesk, they responded immediately; UpWork just makes excuses and tries to shift the blame. Their site frequently goes down, but when I've reported it, they've claimed it was a problem with my computer (it's not - I've been a a computer professional for decades and know when the problem is my computer and when it's the site). For nearly three years, oDesk was the only place I looked, but that's ended. I had constant work with oDesk, but since it became UpWork I've had only one very small job even though I've been looking constantly. I'm still looking for work on UpWork, but I'm now also looking for other sources of work. Losing oDesk was a major loss for the freelancing community.",0
"They just stole my money without providing any information. Something from ""outside"" told them I broke their policy and they have scammed me without any rights to an appeal. NEVER RECOMMEND!",0
"Upwork looks polished, professional and ""committed"" to providing writers with excellent freelancing opportunities. Until, that is, you see the riff-raff that post jobs. Indeed you'll find out quickly that the vast majority of posters show total disrespect to writers and the writing profession by offering 1970's wages, yet expecting professional quality work. For example, it's very common to see job offerings of $.01 per word, or $25.00 ""total budget"" for an 8 page article that would take most accomplished writers a minimum of several days to research, write and complete. I've seen ads for 35,000 word e-books paying a generous $75 (that's THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND words). Of course, anything less than $.25 per word is basically slave labor, and even $.25 is amateurish. Apparently, many clients posting jobs have no idea what writers should be remunerated or are simply taking advantage of newbies eager to get work. Additionally, many posters are foreign and seem to think that it's okay to stiff 'Western-based' writers. I'd avoid Upwork by any writer with credentials like I would a raccoon with rabies.",0
Terrible support and highly questionable business practices. Will delete account once monies are released.,0
This is the worst site ever. Any freelancer I've hired from there has ruined things on my site and has cost me double to have their work fixed. Anybody can sign up and say they have experience. To prove it I signed up as a SEO specialist (I have zero experience) I was given rising talent status by upwork for completing a couple things on my profile. Stay away!,1
"They outsource all of their customer service, can't get anyone on the phone in the US, and their practices make it next to impossible for new providers to get any work. They require ID verification. I don't know about you, but I'm NOT sending my ID to a foreign country. In fact I'm not sending my ID to a US company. They claim to be the #1 freelance platform in the world. What a freaking joke! If that is true, then why aren't they running their ID verification through a portal like Equifax or Been Verified? They aren't. And we just closed our account out with them. Good riddance. And 20% fees? These people SUUUUUCK. They even charge the clients now. Nothing like the rich getting more greedy and what was once an awesome US company is now a bunch of foreigners.",0
Very poor site I have 2 grand right now on fraud checks I have no clue what to do with . I have reported them to the fbi and bbb. I also got harressment by the community for something I did do but other client hired me to do.,0

Upwork is Downwork!!!!,0
"This upwork do not appreciate their freelancers. They make you feel like your a crap, even though they earn money from YOU. Well not anymore, I will go directly to clients and get paid for what my talent is really worth. To Filipinos, you may want to consider finding work with onlinejobs.ph whether you are a newbie or experienced. I AGREE TO THIS GUY! ITS VERY TRUE! Experienced freelancers are dying on this platform. Their ranking system will punish you and your Job Success score if you make ""ANY"" mistake. Once you are below 90% you will never get work again. Their ranking system punishes freelancers if the client does not leave feedback - Your fault. Their ranking system will punish you if there are any problems with a job.",0
Upworks is slandering and libeling the freelancers with the jss. They need to be sued!!!!,0
"As with the other reviews, I have to say UpWork has to replace its name with either CheapWork or BugWork. What the others say about the hiring is true. I started freelancing on oDesk Feb of this year and everything was great. I got hired for my rates (which was WAAAY above $5 lol) and I was at peace. UpWork had potential specially since the connects introduction. I had a few good clients because of connects but it's the rating and feedback system that's killing the freelancers. The JSS isn't transparent or reliable enough, DownWork thinks clients know what JSS means, the private feedback system is causing freelancers to get penalized without them knowing WHY they were suspended or banned. Just go to the forums and you'll know just how FLAWED the JSS is. It's even known to cause your proposals to be hidden. HIDDEN. No matter how good you are in writing cover letters or even if your profile is outstanding, if UpWork's biased algorithm goes for the newbie who charges $5/hr then you're dead in the water. DEAD. The most logical way to escape the wrath of an immature client? 100% refund. That's right, all your hard work is at the mercy of a client's dumb remarks on the freelancer. Heck, if I wanted free quality work I'd sign up as a client, hire the best and expensive freelancer, get the work, then threaten them to refund or they get poor feedback. Some freelancers win disputes, others spend money on arbitration to win (around $250), others they'd rather refund than go to all the trouble and stress of losing their account for no legal reason whatsoever. The best part of UpWork USED to be the community but Garnor Morantes and Valeria Kochubei (community mods/bots) prefer fascism instead of democracy so that means no one, I repeat, no one can say or mention anything wrong with the website in the forums. Otherwise you get banned. The others are also NOT allowed to speak of the banned members, as if they didn't exist. Do you know how scary that is? Think 1984 except Big Brother is divided into 5 moderators. The most sensible of the moderators is Lena so if you have anything to ask, go for Lena and NO ONE else. Lena is generous enough to provide human feedback at the very least. She also drops hints on secret stuff sometimes. Hi Lena ;) I used to think UpWork is the end-all but after the JSS mishaps, the bugs, and the sudden influx of cheap/scam clients (some of which are freelancers wanting to reduce other freelancer's connects), I was forced to go for private clients. I'm lucky to have scored two a few weeks back and they're definitely a cut above the rest. One client is paying me $30/hr to write articles and another for $50 per 500 words. On UpWork you're lucky if you get hired for $18/hour. Heck, with the current state, you're lucky if you go past $11! About the bugs, the site has a tendency to change or reprogram things while it's ONLINE. The engineers don't care about the ramifications of changing the wings of a plane mid-flight but the passengers sure do. They also change things WITHOUT our consent. Like one day everything's fine then the next our message system is changed, our UI is different, our applications interface was overhauled, it's like you go away for two weeks and when you come back you won't recognize the site at all. No announcements, no explanations, 0 transparency with EVERYTHING. Odesk was great. Really great. I miss it like an old friend and UpWork's like the bully in gradeschool who torments every other kid simply because he's bigger and stronger. The worst part is no one cares. I can't wait for the site to realize their mistakes. In the meantime, I recommend you go with private clients or search for us on Freelance Portals. Freelance Portals is our stand against UpWork and all freelancers are welcome to take refuge and get their best clients there specially those who've had enough with UpWork's dictatorship.",0
"If you are new to freelancing do not work here. Experienced freelancers are dying on this platform. Too many freelancers and not enough clients. Clients are often scammers so be very careful. Their ranking system will punish you and your Job Success score if you make ""ANY"" mistake. Once you are below 90% you will never get work again. Their ranking system punishes freelancers if the client does not leave feedback - Your fault. Their ranking system will punish you if there are any problems with a job. Bad clients only need complain and Upwork will give them all your money back. Even if you did a good job and can prove it. You'll also be punished again. Feedback from Elance jobs from 1-2 years ago will go against you if none was left. You have no control over this and you are punished. The system crashes 3-5 times a week. The message system constantly breaking down and if you miss a job offer, you are punished. Wording on the site is done by non English speaking people. English language - Masterful is considered the same as Native English?? New jobs are listed as Recency ?? The CEO does not seem to have any idea what his people are doing to ruin this site. Odesk used to be a good place to work. Upwork is very scary with all the hundreds of rules you MUST know. Great freelancers with 5 years + experience cannot get jobs unless their rates are really low. Clients are very cheap. $5 jobs are everywhere and mostly scammers. Customer support people are not English speakers for the most part and can only copy and past canned answers. There is no help for freelancers. Clients do not know how to use this complicated platform. Never work for a new client. It will cost you Job Success points. The overall experience is awful and very stressful and very difficult for new people. I would never recommend this site to anyone.",0

"Just a short note. I have hired over 23 freelancers and completed over 30 jobs on elance in the last 4 years. I had a problem with one freelancer and attempted to resolve via their very confusing process. I could NEVER get anyone to speak to me on the phone. In short, I paid a freelancer $219 for work that was never performed correctly and Elance did not speak with me to resolve. They would only send emails. Not acceptable to me. I am moving away from them.",1
Upwork is full of scammers and cheap clients who are paying penny's for the work. Upwork nowhere stands in front of Elance. UI is horrible and you are unable to find-out which client is good or which is bad. Please avoid this down-market platform.,0
I had my 5 star account closed without any warning. I was informed that my client satisfaction was low and they would not reconsider my account. That was in September. Since then I have had numerous emails from them telling me that my account satisfaction is low and I should try to improve it. The latest email states that I need to pay a client back $9 as they found I had not completed the job to satisfaction. Fine. I just wanted Elance out of my life so I agreed to pay. Now I have been told I need to do a wire transfer as they don't accept PayPal. So I need to pay $45 in fees and drive a 4 hour round trip to sort out a money transfer. Yeah right. Elance can go jump in a lake.,0
"I want to know which FEDERAL AGENCY I can ask to investigate this group. They take money into escrow and then it magicallly disappears. Freelancers write with complaints about money and completed work disappearing. The site is IMPOSSIBLE to navigate, with tabs and labels that make no sense. Oh! Do NOT enroll or sign up. So much of my outsourced work has been lost, incomplete, late or never even received by the bidder. On a side note, the freelancers are non English speakers who really cannot handle even mildly sophisticated projects.",1
"Elance is a haven for scammers and swindlers. I have been involved with them sporadically these past few months, and I have found that there are various loopholes that exist which make payment assurance rather sketchy. I had one client where the platform worked well, merely because the guy was ethical; however, I ran into another seedy individual and in short, it has been a complete nightmare in getting payment. We had clear terms, exchanged an agreement, I completed the work according to specification and time frames, had the work accepted, and then the guy decides he was not paying. I contacted the Elance dispute department, only to find out that they could not offer me protection because of how the job was set up - it was an hourly job instead of a fixed price. This absurdity now has put me out of receiving payment and was given a ""tough luck"" attitude from Elance. In addition, bear in mind, that the people that post jobs on Elance are looking for CHEAP labor. A good majority of the freelancers post from third world countries and really drive the pay down overall for everyone else. Once you begin with such a low pay and then have to dish out the +8% fee for Elance you really feel like the place promotes slavery. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this site.",0
I had excellent experience on elance so I decided to give its so called new verion upwork a try. I hired workers for several projects but each time my experince was pathetic. Possibly this site is crowded with fake workers who show great work on their profile but actually deliver crap. Will never recommend.,1
"May 24, 2018 update: I see nothing has gotten better at UpWork since I posted a year ago. If it's any consolation, they are slowly going down in ranking, according to Alexa. They've been in a downturn for well over a year now since they upped their commission to 20%. I sometimes jump into the ""Community"" discussion boards and read through the complaints, which are addressed by a small hand-picked group of individuals who lie and make excuses for UpWork. Like how UpWork can't be responsible for phony job postings, it's too much for them to keep up with so they rely on freelancers to figure it out for themselves and then report them. That's freaking incredible. Worst site ever. April 1, 2017 update: I needed some Google compliance work done on one of my websites so I ran a job on UpWork and found a good guy who did a great job. That was all fine. But I was surprised that at the end of the billing week UpWork just chunked the guy's hours off my credit card without my being able to review and approve the work done. So I have to leave my review at one star as they do try to automate everything and are control freaks. I wanted my web developer to review some advice from one of my SEO accounts and UW wouldn't allow me to message him the user name and password, as that would be considered paying him off site. What? Creepy site. Very creepy. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- If you scroll down slightly you will see a review by J.M. Everything he says is absolutely true. UpWork has subsumed Elance and it's the WalMart for freelancers: high volume + low prices + cheap labor = profits for Stephane Kasriel, the %&#@ CEO who sold us out. And they are trying to automate the site and reduce staff, therefore boosting profits. I have an avatar pic of Queen Elizabeth I on my profile, I listed my hourly rate at $285 to mock them and I've never even bid on a job there, and yet I get an email telling me I am a ""Top Rated"" freelancer now and I need to jump to the site and starting quoting jobs. It's a scam!",0
"Elance closed my account for no reason First,they contacted me saying my account doesn't contain original content....without explaining what that means.I've had the same account for 3 years.All 4.9-5 star reviews.And after a week they notified me that my account is closed because the clients were not satisfied with my work...I asked to tell me who are those clients and why they didn't leave a bad review so I can respond,to which they replied they are not allowed to give me that kind of information and that is their final decision.",0
What I recently found is that the elance may have a team who post the project and yes fake projects. Now if we bid on this project there is no response and the connect is gone too. Like this they sell connects for more profit. Recently I applied for a job and I was awarded and after that I could not post any messages to the client. Now this issues happened and i did not got any message from the client too. So to keep my profile clean I closed the job. Now since then they have blocked me. Now how the hell do I know. So Elance is Going to be a big SCAM. In coming days Scam from Elance is going to be famous. Elance Scam as I searched and found tons of result. This confirms that the elance is really doing something fishy to trap users and loot their money throught selling the connects and posting the fake projects.,0
"This's not about scammers or about how bad they've treated me (not the case) I'm not going to waste much time saying how many times their platform is down or the countless number of bugs we Upwork users have to endure. I want to focus rather on the fact that they don't care about their community. They don't listen. I'm going to give an example for everybody to understand how they act: they've introduced a new rating system (Job Success) that's completely opaque. You have some suggestions about how the system operates but most of the rating algorithm is unknown. All you have as a freelancer is a number. Really. That metric's the first thing that clients get to see and you find suddenly that your >30 projects finished with 5-starts are replaced by a Job Success of 65%. No kidding. Your many 5-starts are removed from the forefront and remain in your profile where clients will not make to. Nobody will tell you why you have such a low Job Score no matter how many times you contact Customer Support and you end up out of business (no discerning client contracts anybody whose Job Success is that low) To add insult to injury the rating system is retroactive and things that were perfectly acceptable before (e.g. closing a contract or having idle contracts) affect now your Job Success dramatically. You cannot do anything since it is already in your history. That's how they do things. So, be careful with these guys. Do use their platform but look out: they cannot care less about their freelancers. You may be a quite successful freelancer using their platform and one week later they've moved the goalposts and you are out of business.",0
Elance suspend my account without any reason i have 5 rating,0
i create my account but there a very poor design and service i will never back on elance,0
"I had a skirt that I wanted a pattern for.elance has pattern makers so I thought this is perfect. Submitted a photo and got a reply and hired this guy who I will name later.in reading his resume it states in printable format,so I ask for PDF format.maybe I do not know the ins and outs of pattern making but I knew what I wanted.so once it was finished he sent and I could not get it to print in any PDF.tried for days,finally frustrated told him this is not what I paid for I needed to print it out.but evidently printing on a4 copy paper cost more money,now I'm mad.not willing to pay more.so he sent me the measurements and for about a week I tried to make the pattern by his measurements,only to finally get it sewed together and it was not right.completely different skirt.wasted my time and money here.do not buy from pattern maker unless you know the ins and outs of pattern making.never again!",1
They make up stories as to why they have to close your account and they will just close it for no reason. They make up stories and say that you have had too many bad reviews. I have a 4.8 / 5! And I have not done any work in like 6 months through Elance. How can I all of a sudden have bad reviews. VERY VERY Shady company. I would never use them again.,0
"Elance has a consistent reputation of treating freelancers like trash. A simple Google search shows that Elance will not hesitate to go against freelancers and has consistently sided with clients who are at fault. In addition, they randomly close accounts of freelancers that have consistently good track records with the vague response that client dissatisfaction has increased, and will provide NO evidence to back their decision. Furthermore, in their own TOS, they specifically point out that they have the right to close any account, whenever they want, no questions asked and no heads up given. This is a HORRIBLE company that doesn't have freelancers that generate money for them in mind. STAY AWAY.",0
"I used to think Elance was great. I had great ratings, and satisfied customers, and they made plenty of money off me. Then they just closed my account for no reason. I discovered I am not alone - they did this to many freelancers, who knows why. Some algorithm fires you without warning. BEWARE. One day you get a mail informing you that they honeymoon is over. No explanation, except for a generic mail that doesn't apply, and that's it. Goodbye, don't call us... we won't call you. Sadly, they are still holding on to my earnings, never mind that the rent is due. I depend on that income, now its gone. STAY AWAY!!!",0
"Just got my perfect 5 star account banned because I had jobs opened from people who never paid to see if they would comeback to pay me. So basically if Elance sees you're being scammed by non paying clients they will close your account, get this the reason will be ""Unfortunately, your client satisfaction remains low and that, we believe, has a significant negative impact on our community and users and indicates a violation of the Terms of Service."" Even though my account (as I type this) is a perfect 5.0 stars with over 50 jobs completed.",0
"This toxic company was all right when it started, but evolved into a flagrant example of the sociopathy currently destroying American capitalism. It has sought and obtained a laughable US patent on online competitive bidding. It has tried to compel honest workers into unethical practices and robbed them of the ability to seek justice though arbitration clauses. If workers tried to leave, the company could apparently invent and circulate falsehoods against them, perhaps without legal recourse. I'd say stay far away, but apparently it's finally closing down. I hope they try to turn it around in their next endeavors.",0
I have been a successful freelancer on Elance with an impressive work history and rating and my profile was transferred to Upwork about two months back. I was delighted to get a brand new platform for my work expecting to raise my income and getting more quality jobs but never knew there were several surprises waiting for me. I applied for too many jobs but didn't receive a single project in a month. It's hilarious because it's always an easy cake for me to receive projects on Elance. There's really something WRONG with Upwork.,0
"Upwork is the new identity of Elance and Odesk, freelance website. Their site is run by a customer service group overseas as for the most part this 'company' is all outsourced, even though they have a California Address. There is NO money to be made on Upwork as most of the job posters want to pay peanuts, and there are literally hundreds of bids on each job, all from cheap freelancers in Asia. Save your money and time and go elsewhere. Upwork also has a 'Private Talent Cloud' that really is a staffing agency that 'hires' freelancers to skirt around the IRS employee rules, and to avoid paying employer taxes and health insurance. If you get an invitation to interview for this 'Private Cloud' or Talent pool, run! They invite people making it sound exclusive but the only ones that benefits are the 'owners' of Upwork as they make you pay to be an employee, with no benefits. Stay away.",0
"Beware of Elance - Use at your own risk. I have contracted developers from Elance which have pulled out midway through leaving me with an unfinished build and partial source codes. After filing a dispute with Elance the developer agreed to return a portion of the funds paid to him. That developer never returned the funds and removed his company and himself from Elance. When i asked Elance for assistance i was told that they could only provide me with his contact info and i could persue this matter outside of Elance. So lets review - a developer promoted on their webpage - quits the job and agrees to refund me - instead he closes shop, runs and the organization promoting him, collecting their job fees along with developers payment tells me to persue him outside of them. Elance is designed to bring foreign developers (mine from India) to American entrepreneurs. They wash their hands of the matter providing zero assistance. So now I must hire a lawyer from india (on my own) to retrieve my funds. I never the job completed, lost money and must chase this developer. SAVE YOURSELF THE AGGRAVATION, HEADACHE AND LOST FUND. STAY FAR AWAY FAR FAR AWAY FROM ELANCE.",1
"Elance has suspended my account for bidding on proposals . it has been almost more than 2 weeks and their risk management department is not replying to my emails and chats. i have chat with customer support services personals but all in vain. i called on elance helpline but they say me that Risk management department will reply you but they are not contacting me. They also have held my money from withdrawing from my account. its getting worse and worse... I have noticed that lot of people has facing same issue. now i understood elance is not safe for keeping balance... they are taking long time for solving a simple matter, don't understanding freelancer feelings",0

"I friend of mine recommended me Elance.com and I tried to use it. I was trying to authenticate my credit card, I was charged to authenticate my credit card and now I can't even log in at Elance.com. I always receive the same message saying: ""Your Elance account is expired"". I made 3 requests at Elance Customer Support and didn't receive any contact from them. I tried to call them and they said that they don't know what happened and they will return my contact in 48 hours. That's really a problem because I am about to loose a job opportunity because my boos was willing to pay me by Elance and now my account is expired!!!? That's seems to be scam, All my requests are ignored and you CHARGED my credit card. That's a shame.",0
"I sent refund request, that has been accepted by freelancer. I have filled a statement of work etc, specified i get a refund if something goes wrong. Freelancer did accept the refund request of mine, however since they do not have money on their account i have to wait till they do top up their account, which obviously never going to happen. What da f**k is refund request for if not to get your m*********g money back?",1
"We got ripped off by our freelancer. Elance released the funds they held from us to the webdesigner even though he had never finished the job. We called the customer service: unfriendly, unprofessional, giving us the feeling that they did not care and above all they did not do anything to get back our money or to make sure our website would be finished. In the end we even got charged for copyright violation by GettyImages because the webdesigner had used stolen material from the web. I do understand all the good reviews from freelancers: they can basically do whatever they want!",1
"The following site is the definitive expose of the iWriter scam and the information there applies to many other freelance writing sites as well. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BELIEVE THE INFORMATION YOU FIND THERE. http://the-giant-iwriter-scam.blogspot.ca/ One of the biggest online scams right now is in the ""freelance writing"" area. The biggest company in this area is called iWriter and it is maybe the biggest online scam period. Ignore all the fake positive reviews and fake websites recommending iWriter while pretending to be independent, they are all a part of the scam. Iwriter is not just a huge scam, it is maybe the biggest of all the online scams. There is an awesome website that uncovers the whole iWriter scam in great detail. The site is hilarious and extremely well-written. It's also very thorough and comprehensive, maybe the best resource available yet on the iWriter scam. That website shows clearly how fraud is not just peripheral to iWriter, but on the contrary, EVERYTHING at iWriter is fraud and scamming. iWriter needs to be exposed to everyone until the iWriter scam is finally shut down.",0
"Elance has 161 complaints with BBB in last 3 years! FACT! Do not use their services. They provide no protection for you and allow their freelancers to do what ever they want! I paid over $5000 for a website that never worked, they won't do anything and will continue to allow this freelancer to take money from unprotected customers. Plus this freelancer held my passwords ransom unless I gave them a good review. BE WARNED! ELANCE can't protect you! *I would have left no stars checked if I could have!",1
Elance have overcharged me months ago and if I didn't look back at my bank records I would not have known. They advised they charged one figure and a larger figure was actually charged. They have not at all addressed the issue. If anyone knows who/where I can go to escalate this issue let me know. Extremely poor experience!,0
"I just had my account shut down on elance as someone who was testing the waters to hire freelancers to complete programming tasks for my startup. I have to say the one freelancer I hired who accepted a proposal did an amazing job. I had one other one who flaked out, and no bites on the 5 other jobs I posted. I think the reason my account was shut down is ludicrous. Because my jobs haven't led to activity? I posted 10 private jobs of which only 2 people applied for after I invited over 100? I don't understand why my account was suspended? If my jobs are private, it's not like others are out there trying to apply for them. Of the two people I hired, one completely flaked out on me mid-job, and the other completed the job and was paid upon completion. As far as I'm concerned they system failed me, which Is why I don't understand why my account was closed? What's the point of private listings, if you have to have them fulfilled? That's what I had understood one of the comforts of posting a private listing, as that I didn't have people applying for a job without me not issuing it. I had a strict criteria of candidates, of which none applied. I wasn't low-balling either, I agreed to pay their market rate. Was I supposed to withdraw my jobs after nobody qualified for them? Or should I have loosened up my requirements and given the work to someone who was unqualified? Or should I just not post requirements which might not find a qualified candidate and hire a proper firm? You've left me in the dark here with no reasonable explanation. The fact that I am expected to commission unqualified candidates is sheer lunacy. Perhaps I set the bar too high in hoping to use elance. Perhaps it's more for hobbyist programmers? I will be happy to take my business to any of the competing freelance companies.",1
"A employer hired me to do a job and then bailed on the project. I was doing decent business until I get hired for a project by what I think was a scammer.

"I have been calling and trying to work with Elance for the past five weeks. They have locked my account due to inactivity in my account (I hadnt filled out a status report from one of my clients) As soon as I was made aware of this I immediately took all the actions that they requested. What followed was radio silence. You cannot speak to Risk Management (who start at 12:00 EST) and they are the only people that can clear my account. I was told by one of the CS Reps that people have been waiting over a month for their account and there is nothing they can do. Now I am waiting on payment of over $1000.00 and cannot accept another job from a happy client which is another $1000.00 job. The customer service reps are not empowered to do ANYTHING and the poor things just have to listen to complaints. When I finally got a manager on the phone he was rude and told me there was nothing he could do either and that they were waiting fro more information from my client. That was the first time I had heard that in FIVE weeks. I should not be held accountable for the lack of action on their side. I have lost five weeks of work, am unable to pay my bills because they are holding my money and are no help.",0

"Hi, I'm a freelancer who is unfortunately registered on Elance website. I'm a British citizen, and I'm a native English and Turkish speaker, I'm also fluent in French and Spanish. Please see my experience below to see how safe (!) Elance is and how much it protects the freelancers. In December, I was invited by Simi Agarwal from Telematic Solutions from India to submit a proposal to a translation project for a Turkish TV Show. The job description on Elance website was the following: ""We have 50 hours [3000 minutes] of script of TV show which needs to be translated from Turkish to English. The entire script is already written down in word files. You just have to translate it. You dont have to do any time coding or transcription from Audios. We can pay USD 900 for this project. If you are available to start immediately and can write English without mistakes as native English speaker, contact us with your CV."" On Christmas Eve I was contacted by Simi Agarwal who asked me to start working on the project immediately doing the translation of the script attached. However, after completing and sending the translated scripts for 3 episodes, Simi Agarwal asked me to watch all three episodes and arrange the scripts based on the video files, which was clearly not a part of the job description, and it was clearly not communicated to me. On that basis she refused to pay me by relying on Elance website's policy which says ""the client does not have to pay if they are not satisfied with the work provided"". I replied many times and told them that downloading and watching videos was not a part of the job description and that it was not communicated to me. This person is constantly making false statements and already chose the ""Cancel Project"" option which froze all the funds for those three episodes. I would like you to know that this person did not fund Escrow(Elance's payment system for the freelancer's protection in cases similar to this) prior to the start of assignment, so that she can ask to the freelancer to do more work by threatening them with no payment, in my case double work, which was not initially included in the description. And when I refused to do so, she cancelled the payment and kept the scripts I provided. A google search for ""simi agarwal scam"" gives a link to translatorscafe dot com website forum where freelancers explain how and when she was banned from posting any jobs on that website as she was on the Wall of Shame with ""1 as rating. I already contacted the UK police about this person, and also her client in the USA who was very worried to hear about this, I will let everyone know about this process. I simply would like to warn everyone against Simi Agarwal - Telematic Solutions, who takes advantage of Elance policy and steals others' work by providing an incomplete job description to convince people to accept the assignment and then threatening them with no payment if they refuse to do things that were intentionally hidden from the job description. If you have any doubts, questions or require proof to verify the validity of my email, I will be more than happy to provide you with the screenshots of my Skype and email conversation with Simi Agarwal. Thanks and Regards, Kaan",0

We can not issue a refund without the freelancer's consent. I told them that the work was not performed There is no response from them! elance = scam, aman619aggarwal = Indians scammers Fraud Scam company !",1
"This website is a scam! The 'customer service' is offshore in India and the Philippines. They suspend people's paid memberships for no reason, take money that belongs to the freelancers.

"I've worked with several freelancers from Elance with about 60% success but recently I had a horrible experience with one of their freelancers and received very unsatisfactory support. The freelancer is Scoped Design. Here is what happened. I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO PROCEED WITH CAUTION. This freelancer completely swindled me out of $500 and did not deliver the work of customizing a wordpress theme based on Zeyn theme. S/he is the most dishonest person I've dealt with on this service. I had significant correspondence with freelancer prior to accepting job. Scoped_Design then contacted me stating that one of his jobs had cancelled for the week and offered a discount. Now, I of course know why the previous job backed out. They smelled something fishy. He asked for $500 up front stating that he needed to pay the outsourced SEO team, so since we'd had so much correspondence and he was very responsive I (stupidly) released funds. INSTALLED INCORRECT THEME: At that point, Scoped_Design installed a completely different theme on my wordpress site that I'd requested. This process took over a week. TOOK THE MONEY AND RAN: When asked to conform to original job request he did finally install requested theme and then I never heard from him again. ELANCE SUPPORT refused to assist in getting the monies back. They approved my claim agains Scoped Design but since the funds had been released, they seemed to have just dropped it. Good luck with them if you ever need assistance. I'm dismayed that they don't police their freelancers any better than that.",1
"Filed a dispute after a horrible outcome on the job, and Elance forced me to pay for work I couldn't use...NEVER use this site",0
Without any prior notice elance stop expired my account even I have existing contact with 450$ a month. They should not close this account even some bad issue. they can limit feature but I totally disagree they will not close a account. They should warn. Elance scam my money more than 1000k in future life income. I must go to court and get official notice. Its our career issue. So If you work hard take exam test and other hard work all will be vain.,0
Freelance ripped me off totally and Elance will do NOTHING about it. Elance customer support tells me they can give refund my money IF THE FREELANCER would contact them. Well that makes no sense. The freelance ripped me off and so did ELANCE. What a bunch of scammers! Going to ripoff report and let them know too of how bad ELANCE has been.,1
"I see alot of poor reviews from freelancers, but everyone should know that the employers get screwed as well. From the perspective of the one providing the work, I have found that eLance playing field tilted WAY too far towards the freelancer. So much so that when the freelancer doesn't do the work, they get paid. On top of that, since I complained to eLance about the freelancer not doing the work and refused to pay, I seen to have a 500% increase in spam and viruses sent my way through email. How about that. Elance cannot continue sitting back and paying freelancers when there is no proof of work being completed except for a timesheet. I agree with the review that this is a VERY poorly run escrow company. They do nothing to ensure that a product is delivered and that the product is paid for.",1
"I hate to say I am glad I am not the only one who got a letter canceling my account. I literally just got off the phone with them to find out why - ready for this one - I didn't use the account enough. That is why I was dropped. Not bad reviews. Not lack of payment. Because I didn't use their site enough. I've worked with them for 4-5 years and this is the first time I have ever had an issue. And clearly the last time. They did refund my last payment but I don't care. This was ridiculous and clearly I am not the only one confused and upset by this. My advice - don't go there. If they can just randomly with no explanation cancel your membership when you have done NOTHING wrong - that is a problem. Guru, voices.com, or voice123 are much better options. You might pay a little more - but they don't cancel you :)",0
"I recently accepted my first job on Elance and I was completely ripped off. I was hired by someone calling himself ""Joe"" to write copy 8 hours a day, six days a week at $15/hr. I completed two days work for ""Joe"" and received a warning from Elance that I may not get paid because ""Joe's"" payment info wasn't set up. Now, being new to the site, I had no idea that people can post jobs and accept work without having any way to pay for the work they commission. I immediately stopped work and confronted ""Joe"" about the payment issue and he claimed that it was a glitch on Elance's systems. This seemed reasonable to me as Elance's Work View program, an app that Elance uses to track a worker's progress on a project repeatedly stopped working and I was told by an Elance rep that this was a temporary problem. Regardless, I told ""Joe"" I wouldn't resume work until his payment info was resolved. A few days later, ""Joe"" broke off all contact and his account appeared to have been shut down, by Elance or ""Joe"" himself I still don't know. I made a complaint through Elance's Dispute system and waited for a reply. Meanwhile, I googled sections of the copy I wrote and found it posted on a few different sites. I contacted a few of the site owners and heard back for one site admin that he purchased my content through a competing freelancing site called iWriter. ""Joe"" had stolen my content on Elance and resold it a different site. I added this new information to my Elance dispute. Today, I finally heard back from Elance. They dismissed all my complaints and rejected my claims. Now, I realize that I was partially at fault for not finding out that Elance hosts projects with no security for writers, but the fact that Elace essentially cultivates a situation where freelancers can be abused in this manner is shocking. I would highly recommend that any freelance writers who are considering pursuing employment through Elance do literally anything else. Elance is a garbage company with nonexistent ethics.",0
"Based upon the most recent reviews, I see that I am not the only Freelancer to have my Elance account closed with no warning and no response to my queries of support for their decision. I believe that Elance has other motives for closing accounts that are discriminatory in nature. Out of a total of five jobs awarded to me, I had one review that wasn't five stars over 2 years ago, and yet my account was closed due to a high number of negative client experiences. I have asked for the evidence from Elance, but have been ignored. With the experience I have in my profession, it is not unusual to command as much as $250 per hour. My profile was set up with a rate of $55 per hour, but most invitations I receive rarely exceed offers for $10 per hour. I believe my refusing to bid on invitations for jobs that offer to pay $3-$10 per hour might be what Elance considers a high number of negative client experiences. Based upon my belief, this is no excuse for closing an account because I should be afforded the opportunity to decline low budget jobs. Does Elance close accounts for employers that offer rates well below minimum wage? I haven't seen any negative reviews by employers having their accounts closed because on negative Freelancer experiences, so the answer must be NO. Do they close accounts of employers that rarely or never award jobs? The answer is NO. I've seen employers that have over 30 offers posted, and have only awarded 1 job. Elance is a California based company that should not discriminate against Americans for not bidding or accepting well below market or minimum wage rate job offers. THEIR ACCOUNT (Website) SHOULD BE CLOSED! Maybe Freelancers should use Elance to hire an attorney to initiate a Class Action Lawsuit against Elance.",0
"Okay so I had a user account for close to 3 years. One fine day one customer places a dispute against us saying we didn't work as she desired. We showed all proof. At the most Elance could have refunded the money. No what they did was terrible and hard to believe. They asked us to complete the pending stuff (which we said was extra and not in job scope). They said some bonus was paid to us (for different stuff and not this) and hence you have to complete the job now and they also suspended us from accepting any further jobs. Fine working hard within 3 days we did complete what was pending. Client happy. She went away with her project. Now here comes the trouble. We now asked them to restore our account. They simply refused and said our behaviour had problems and this is not the way to treat a customer. We simply don't understand having worked 3 years with more than 200,000 USD business and over 300 positive reviews and only 1-2 negative reviews how come we had behaviour problems all of a sudden. And also why not have the dispute process properly complete and why intervene in between and suspend our account. I thought dispute process was real and Elance is only a third party. But now you sound more of a biased business. Alright so our profile now closed our regular customers we shifted to a newly formed Elance account. We initially just accepted only their work. But as work kept on flowing in and reviews and earnings increased we got more new clients and then again we started bidding. Our profile became again as awesome as the previous one in 2 years and we were starting to think we can rely on Elance now. Sorry here comes the bummer!!! We did 1 job 3 months back for which the client chargeback and Elance sent us message that we have to refund back $1500. But hey Elance.com has Escrow system and you are supposed to protect us from all this. But they simply put the charge on us and said this job doesn't qualify for Escrow protection. In normal circumstances any freelance is protected for upto $2500. But what is normal? Working for 1 month, getting paid and reviewed and then Elance won't protect is it normal?? Again account gets closed!!! Long story Short: Avoid them if you can and have other options. Never ever rely your business on Elance.com This is a real story. Our account ids were: shrikrishnatech and skiltd Our website is shrikrishnatechnologies.com",0
"This is pretty much a stab in the back for the hard work and dedication I had put into Elance. As with many of you we put in the extra effort to have our clients satisfied, thinking the result would be more business for the service we offer. Out of the blue my account was under review with no explanation as to why, other than form letters. ""Close out all your jobs"" and then we will review. I strongly feel it did not matter what I did ... something triggered my account to be shut down. I guess I will never know. In the long run it is better off for me not having to deal with an unprofessional company that does not have the ""Balls"" to talk to me to give a reasonable explanation. I just have to apologize to all the people I have worked with who put the trust in me recommending Elance. Brian Verigin, YahSuccessBlog.com PS .. Elance please stop sending me offers to bid on jobs ... I do not have an account with you.",0
"Elance was great at first but I got notice that my account was closed due to ""too much negative feedback."" First off, I had a solid 5 stars on my reviews with clients saying that they would love to work with me again. Out of 10 projects that I worked on, I had two that I personally disputed. Client number one and I MUTUALLY decided (based on her lack of direction and my inability to pull more information out of her) that her going with another designer would be beneficial. That was MY idea. Client number two disappeared completely. We had our first meeting, discussed workflow and payment and then they stopped responding to me. I called, emailed through Elance... nothing. So I closed the project because I didn't want an open project that was going nowhere. These two reasons are why Elance closed my account WITHOUT talking with me about it first. I received the email this morning and when I emailed them back asking for evidence, they responded saying ""once it's closed it cannot be reopened."" I replied with ""I wasn't asking you to reopen my account, I was asking you for evidence."" Elance, I'm disappointed in you. I was a paid member and you didn't even have the decency to contact me to come to a resolution? Frankly, that's bad business and I for one do NOT appreciate the brush off when I inquired for more information. If I ran my business that way, I wouldn't HAVE a business.",0
"had 2 -3 yrs work through this site as a photographer, a few big jobs 2000$+ so was quite happy but then had one client who took forever to decide on images and suddenly my account was under review which i had no idea what this meant. contacted them and all they could say was the same reply over and over, complete the job and account will be reviewed. so job finished and nothing. so contacted them and within 48 hrs they decided that my account should be closed. no explanation as why they thought that just closed. i have been a pro photographer for over 20 yrs so run a professional business so for them to call my professionalism into doubt really annoys me.at least give the elancer some feedback as why they think this. happy to take my money when i upgraded my account now complete bastards when i ask wtf they are doing this. luckily they are less than 1% of my income but it really f**ks me off how they have treated me.",0

"Hello Guys, I had been working successfully on elance since more than 2 years as a full time web developer. I had successfully completed more than 120 projects over elance and I had 5 out of 5 rating. One day my account was suddenly suspended by elance. I contacted to elance support team about this issue, one of the elance support team guy told me that, It is suspended due to having multiple accounts on elance and he send me a long list of usernames and told me that all these accounts are belonging to me. I shocked by seeing this long list, some of these accounts belong to my friends and relatives. I requested him humbly with all the necessary information that, I have only one account on elance and I am using it since 2 years, I don't have any other account on elance. I also told him that if you found any account belongs to me please delete all these accounts. But, besides look into the issue he always send me the computer generated replies. I requested him many times, but he always denied me to reinstate my account. I also requested him that, if you can't reinstate my account, please delete my current account and other such accounts, and allow me to create new account. But he never addressed my request. I again requested him with few questions but he never addressed these questions and didn't reply back to me. The questions were; Q) When this suspension will end, is it for specific time period or for lifetime? Q) If you can't reinstate my account then when I will be able to create new account on elance or am I unable to create new account on elance for lifetime? Q) If you can't reinstate my account for life time and can't allow me to create new account then please send me the login credential of other account, you believe it belongs to me? At last, I never heard any positive response from them, I again requested them to at least only enable my elance login. Because I have moved to Dubai from my home country for searching job, and I am unable to show my employer company to my last 2 years work history. My login details are not working it always showing me a message that my account has expired, and my profile is not showing publically. If at least my account login will work then I can show my employer company my previous 2 years work history. I am not the only or single victim of this situation, you may find many of the peoples over internet facing same difficulties. You may earn money from elance, but you can't rely on them for career building and life longing work. This platform is best for the unemployed person who is not getting jobs for short period work but not for talented peoples. You may also use this platform for part time earning but not for full time. I may start work on other platform like odesk, freelancer etc. But I will prefer now to get a good job in a good company. At least office admin staff hears you and look after your problems. Many Thanks, Regards, Abdul Samad",0
"It's an unprofessional site with little good work to go around. If you're a writer/graphic designer, there are far too many unserious, cheap clients who want the world but are only willing to pay $20. The system is set up to help clients, not freelancers. If you want to bid on a project (which most of the time costs you money by way of their ""Connects"" system) in more than one category (such as design AND marketing) then you have to pay monthly for a membership plan. It's just a blatant money grab from hopefully young professionals. But once you join, you realize the jobs are of such poor quality, there's no point even bidding. Elance also seems to do nothing to deter spec work since SO many of the writing jobs I've seen plainly ask for spec work right in the job posting. Best to avoid.",0
do not use this company if you pay a freelancer and they do not deliver the product you will not get your money back without going though a ton of red tape and you money is lost . You could lose 10k faster in Vegas with better odds. Stay away. Its a scam....,1
"SPAM / FRAUD warning about Elance user JohnVT a.k.a. vermontinternetdesign We posted a Job offer on Elance ""WP Ecommerce Customization"" This job has been carefully reviewed by specialists and very well documented before we posted it to the Job offers on Elance. Every bider received the complete documentations as well as all the source code and databases to have a look into it before agreeing on the job. JohnVT was one of the bider and stated he can do this (after reading the documentation and reviewing the source codes.) within time and for the offered amount, so i awarded him. http://www.vermontinternetdesign.com/ Shortly after awarding JohnVT from vermontinternetdesign he started to ask for more money, which i denied, as i had clearly stated the budget and he agreed upon that. During this 2 months JohnVT never informed me about the progress and just sent sloppy and grumpy 1 line answers back by email. I explained more than one times to him, that this project is very important to me and my business and i will loose money every day if it will be any longer postponed. Again, no reaction from him except ""Due date end of May"". On the very last day / Deadline he updated the project with ""Need some more days"", without any explanation and nothing. I offered him to present a more or less working project by next Monday and another 4 days to eliminate errors and flaws. After that he comes up and suddenly states ""Job is not possible to complete. Client wants to do something that simply cannot be done"". He did not accept this offer and said he will need more time. The only thing we could offer him was to refund the $500 he got from us and we will cancel the job without taking any further actions. John Anderson ( vermontinternetdesign ) answered as follow : ""There are no refunds. Nor do I plan on sending you any thing. I applied the balance onto time spent on this project."" We guarantee that John Anderson ( vermontinternetdesign ) never ever delivered one single line of code or anything else for that project. There is no work that has been done as he by mistake stated in a earlier email. We have lost 2 full months of time to open up our business because of JohnVT ( vermontinternetdesign ) and therefore lost 2 full months of income from it. We have family and bills to pay and JohnVT did a lot of Damage to us with his ignorant and disrespectful behavior. All the details described earlier can be proved by email conversationand the jobs workroom comments and documents. If you need any further proof, please let me know. I would never write a fraud warning without beeing 100% sure this company knew from the first day on that they will never deliver any work and they feel beeing save as we are overseas. And he is right, Elance will NOT protect or support you in such cases ! Make sure you google for #Elance #Fraud #scam #warning #vermontinternetdesign #johnVT Be warned and feel free to get in touch with us if you need any further details. Regards Daniel",1
"Terrible, I wanted someone to do some marketing for me, he sent me pictures of the Pakistan army with ak-47s and women with plates of money in their hand. I disputed and Elance claimed that I should pay him because he did the work in good faith. I even told him before we started the project that I did not want him to do anything for me and he still did it. He then called me a fraud. Wow, I guess I am naive to the real world for having faith in him. I have recently re-disputed the matter and is currently ongoing. Elance and all of those similar sites are too expensive and you have to compete with people who are willing to work for $5 per hour.",1
"I have now spent well over a week in the process of finding a good writer for a $5000+ project, and I found one through Elance. I have absolutely no objection to compensating any intermediary that helped us find a way to work together. But with my brief experience with them there is no way I would enter a business relationship with Elance. After a series of baffling and maddening interactions with them over the past week, and twice waiting 15 to 20 minutes on hold, I now find: In addition to their bizarre ""credit card authorization process"" (unlike anything anywhere else in the use of a credit card), it is their actual policy to charge an amount to my credit card in excess of what I authorized! They actually think that's OK by condescendingly reassuring me after the fact that there will be a refund ""in 10 days or so""! (The California BBB will be fascinated to learn about this, and there may even be a young Assistant DA in or around Mountain View looking for an interesting way to spend a month or two.) I know incompetence, arrogance, and an ethical tin ear when encounter them. When things start out rife with these ""little early signs"" it never gets better, only worse. I finally did last what I should have done first, which is to look up on the internet whatever reviews from Elance users I could find. Wow! I had to tell of a perfectly good writer I could not proceed, and apologize profusely for wasting his time. Back to Square One, and immensely grateful to be there. Dale Delmege 760-4154-0128",0
"Recently my account was closed by elance saying that i am not getting any work from Elance clients recently. I argued with them on how i have qualified for many exams and their criteria of closing an account is just unfair. They need to check various parameters and not just one parameter of how much job someone has gained. Check how they are bidding, how they are interacting with the clients. Do they act professional and do the freelancer give more thoughts on their bids. When i argued with them that they need to re-think on their parameters on which they decide whose accounts should be closed, they simple said they cannot help. I found like i am dealing with some Freelancer.com representative, which i found to be so irrational that it was hard to deal with them. Their linear way of closing down my account was just so stupid that i could not accept it and here i am to rant on that issue. I am very disappointed as my profile has 2 client reviews with whom i worked 2 years ago. Simply closing an account without any advance notification that you account will be closed is so so bad. Did not expect this from Elance.",0

"elance.com | The Freelancer site full Schemes I staying with the theme about having your Guatemala web site found on line I suggest any owner of a web site or business avoid using elance.com. The reasons are monumental to be brief, the company lacks any credibility and allows hacks and those without talent to offer services in the area of WP and SEO freelance services on elance.com. If you happen to google elance.com complaints you will find hundreds of pages of complaints, customer complaints about elance.com. Complaints from customer being ripped off by freelancers offers SEO services who no nothing about SEO and Freelancers being ripped off by elance.com for payments. The complaints are real and cover sites such as www.complaintsboard.com/ and http://www.ripoffreport.com as examples. The company if one is behind elance.com never respond to complaints. I also came across this article http://freelancewrite.about.com/b/2009/03/01/is-it-time-to-revisit-the-elancecom-debate.htm which spells out elance. We joined elance.com only to find that most of the jobs for WordPress and SEO were posted by companies claiming to have this area of expertise when in fact these job posts were to fix problems these Freelancers had created for there own clients. Needing some one who new about technology to solve the problem they created for clients from elance.com. Most job posts are for SEO after Google updates and those claiming to be knowledgeable about SEO are offering SEO Schemes to solve client issues. Spammers and Scammers on elance.com can be found with almost every claimed job posting. Individuals claiming to need WordPress and SEO help. What these folks that are doing is posting false jobs, and are looking for free advise to solve there own problems. Elance.com allows jobs to be posted for violations of all kinds of work ethics. Back linking services about on e-lance, find me a 1000 facebook friends are a small example of the fact the elance.com does not care about what is posted on its site just about money. Lets talk about money, elance.com takes it from all sides, a % from the person posting the job, a commission from the freelancer a whopping 8% . I figure on every job awarded elance.com is skimming at least 12% off the top. Almost as bad as Paypal. In order to bid on jobs you have to buy connections and must pay to be in categories or the services you want to supply. What starts as a FREE deal on elance can quickly have you shelling out over 70 a month in membership fee to be able to bid on 60 projects. Projects largely posted by spammers and scammers. So what you may say, well for example elance.com lets unproven SEO talent use SEO Schemes to have a client land on the first page of Google and I mean elance.com has thousands of these back link Schemes offer by this claimed Freelance talent base. So I have an SEO freelance company do this to my site. It destroys your web sites on line ranking and credibility and the cost to repair will be far greater then the cost you paid to be hooked into this Scheme. Beware of elance.com the complaints clearly speak for what this site is all about complaints about elance.com",0

"Think you're able to rely upon freelancers' past client feedback? Think again.

I wasted my time crafting my considered feedback, and now prospective clients to this supplier will be none the wiser. What a JOKE upwork's feedback system is! On a more minor note, upwork's practice of making you click on a button each and every time you click a provider's link to check their sample work is a frustrating waste of our time.

"I have found the CS to be okay and looks to be interesting projects but i the JSS is a mystery wrapped in an enigma and the 20% fee is absurd.

Dear Clients: When choosing a freelancer, please look past the JSS and perform substantive interviews, ask the freelancer about the low score, but above, all please don't decide against someone based on a questionable scoring system. As for the fee, I'm no longer willing to hand over hundreds of dollars to the site just because it provides a forum to find projects--and with a good number of the projects never awarded, posted by unverified users or outright scams this benefit is of somewhat dubious value.",0

Total invasion of privacy and feels like the employer is standing over your shoulder. Also, they have to ""review"" your account and it takes 24 hours+ to do so, which will make you loose opportunities to other bidders for lucrative jobs. There's a way better way to do this that respects the privacy of the users and doesn't tie their hands so much. They also take 20% of your income for your first $500 in profit, and then lower the rate after that to 10%, which can be a lot depending on what you're doing.",0
AXhive solutions are scammers! Beware! They are not professionals and will leave you with nothing. The little work I did see was subpar.,1
I had an issue with a freelancer I hired going MIA. He got paid for 1/2 the job went and then went silent. Upwork is more concerned with keeping every dollar than admitting when something goes wrong and correcting it. You provide security for the freelancer but what security do the people and companies hiring these freelancers get? After months of dealing with the very unprofessional CS team they FINALY came to a resolution when they could't get in contact with the freelancer either. They were suppose to refund my money back to my credit card as I explicitly stated. They gave me a credit and it was used my another person on my team. HENCE ME EXPLICITLY stating refund back to the original form of payment.,1
"After contacting them, being told they'd take my license and then having them refuse to even look at it was typical of how they behave. Today they did add a license verification system so at least they have solved that offensive issue. Now, I'll indeed see how the rest of it all works out...20%, however is still a rip off, in IMHO.",0
"Be very careful who you hire on Upwork because if things go wrong, Upwork's powers of mediation are none existent, even if you present an infallible case! Having raised such a case for mediation - due to freelancer unable to complete the job as agreed, as well as overcharging despite agreeing a fixed fee! - they simply didn't want to know. It is my opinion that Upwork's allegiance is firmly with their freelancers who, lets face it, pay them a big commission (20%!!) for each job they get. So if they were to award in favour of the Client, it would dent their own profits! (where's the sense in that!?!) Upwork mediation - Inept, toothless and bordering on unethical. Hence the review.",1
"For sucess on upwork how to do ? Actually, I dont want to work on upwork after checking a lot of review...",0
"UpWork only cares about the money from their clients. Freelancers work is irrelevant to them. They will vouch for the client more than anything, and t hey won't care what the freelancer thinks. An individual is underpaid and overworked. I don't recommend this organization to anyone. In fact, work outside your house if you can.",0
"Initially UpWork delighted with a clean user experience and easy setup. Unfortunately you will quickly find they are good at billing you, but reluctant to pay your contractors. We've spent four weeks trying to solve a payment issue with a contractor who we had told we would be paying every two weeks. Horrible customer service has pushed us off and failed to take quick ownership of the problems. We are taking steps to move away from UpWork as quickly as possibly.",0
"I have had an account on upwork since they were odesk. I did many projects under odesk and if you can actually find a good company that is willing to pay, as opposed to preferring someone from the Philippines that works for a dollar an hour or a penny a word, then that would be the single thing that is good about upwork. If I would have known how much it has changed, I never would have worked through them again. On a $600 check, they take $120 in FEES!!! I will never do another contract through upwork. You do all the work, and they get 20% of your money. They wonder why people meet outside on Skype or something and then become a contractor outside of the network, just in case they don't know why yet, it's your crazy, outrageous, government-like fees!! They literally take 20% of your money until you make over $600, and then they take 10% of your money! This is not including taxes or anything else. Trust me, use upwork for the contacts, and then ask the employer for a separate agreement outside of them. Although you take a minimal risk in the person not paying, just do only a certain amount of work upfront that you can afford to lose to make sure that they are upstanding. That's the only way to make sure you can eat everyday...because Upwork doesn't care if you do.",0
"Many years ago I had used oDesk to find freelance website developers. I had some success and was general satisfied. Then Upwork purchased Odesk and it all changed. The biggest change was in the trustworthiness of their freelancers and the way they made it impossible to work with their freelancers to manage websites without risking getting ripped off by the freelancers. I finally did get ripped off by a freelance so bad I will never use them again. If anyone wants to know who the Upwork freelancer that scammed me was, feel free to contact me at 570 975 5805",1
"You can find work such as ""I have this 1500 page pdf and I need all the data manually typed into Excel."" Generally that's a $ entry level job for which they think you should receive $10 total for your work, then Upwork will take 20%, you'll put in endless hours--and the client realllly wants it by tomorrow morning (after not responding to any proposals/awarding the job for hours the night before their deadline). And as a bonus, you get to compete against 20-50 people putting in bids in an hour for this 'privilege.' Unless you value really wanting to be slave labor, don't bid on anything except something that seems legit, verified, where the client has awarded previous work and paid on it, and where it will be worth your while.",0
"I was an Elancer for 6-years and LOVED it. I've been on Upwork for a year and make peanuts. The interface sucks, the job pay for most jobs suck, and while I get an occassional job, it is nothing worth bragging about. A recent issue with a client resulted in a $30 loss for me with agreement for the client from the start. I really hate the site but what can you do until you find one that is free like this one? I did write this book if anyone wants to look. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WQ3YFZ0",0
"I am a freelancer who occasionally uses Upwork. I was ripped off last week by a client who canceled my contract and asked Upwork not to pay me. I protested this action to Upwork and requested arbitration. My protest was denied because ""I had not taken notes on the work that I was doing."" Upwork has screen shots of my work plus a copy of the completed work yet used a technicality to avoid payment. It is my belief that THERE IS NO ARBITRATION. Upwork will always side with the client. I placed a call to a ""Dispute Resolution Specialist"" who knew only enough to read from a prepared script. He was, of course, in India and had no ability whatsoever to interpret the dispute. I gave Upwork two stars instead of one because their website is at least much easier to use than others.",0
"The idea of Upwork is actually quite a good one. Find a freelancer matching the skillset you need, and pay competitive prices for it. However, as seen with the majority of the rest of these reviews, they don't actually offer any protection to the customer, with cowboy freelancers rife. I've now used three different freelancers that have blatantly lied about their skills in order to get paid. Upwork claim that they have buyer protection in place, but their system to refund is flawed and doesn't make sense for the workflow of any business. All the protection is on the freelancer, use with caution and if in any doubt, claim before 30 days after first payment. My advice: avoid, use a competitor.",1
"UPDATE: Upwork finally paid me the money it owed me as of April 29... on June 15. After taking its $150 fee for ""facilitating"" the project. I don't know if I'll ever take a job through Upwork again. Too much headache, no accountability. ORIGINAL POST: Upwork is currently withholding $1,500 that I earned a month ago and refusing to transfer these funds to my bank account. I completed 25 hours of legal research work for a client through Upwork at the end of April 2016, relying on the fact that Upwork showed the job was funded for the agreed upon $1,500 project fee, signaling to me that the client had placed the money in escrow with Upwork and I would be paid promptly upon successful completion of the project. I completed the project end of April and the client authorized the $1,500 payment in early May, then Upwork notified me that due to unspecified ""issues"" with the client's account, they will not transfer funds to my bank, ""in case we need to reverse funds from your client's payment that do not qualify for the Upwork Payment Guarantee."" Don't take jobs through Upwork. They clearly do not have your back as a legitimate knowledge worker.",0
"I have encountered two scams so far on the upwork.com platform for freelancers. One where I even even lost money because you want to believe that such platforms do adequate screening of clients and freelancers,alike. After my ordeal it was then I found sites such as sitejabber.com and even the upwork.com community blog section report cases of clients who are offering bogus work.Very disappointed as I am an individual who is honestly looking for legitimate work, willing to give her all. If this is also you,look elsewhere to showcase yours skills and look elsewhere for freelance work.",0
"I have done quite a bit of work through Upwork and the one thing that rings true through all of my work is the lack of pay. I was writing for one online paper and earning only $1.50 per 400 word article. I took the job only for the by-line. I kept my work, and that was very important to me. The major drawback was the amount of time I spent researching the articles I was writing. I would spend 3/4 of my day doing research for between 2 and 4 articles each day. I have since been asked to do many, MANY jobs that pay less than $1 per 100 words. I am not going to spend my precious time researching an article to make that amount of money. Being a writer is something that is part of who we are. It is an art and we should be paid accordingly. I will also say that the number of scam artists on this site is staggering! I have been approached by a group trying to get my bank information at least 8 times in 6 months. You have to be so careful with these people, it is really easy to get fooled. And, the first time I got scammed, Upwork suspended MY account because they said I didn't perform the job correctly! I do not like having to research each job because the scammers are so prevalent. All I can say, honestly, is do your research, get what you are worth! Don't take a job just because you will get the by-line, I learned my lesson on that one.",0
"To start with, let me clarify that I'm a top-rated Upwork freelancer and have been getting good business there. However, ever since they re-branded as Upwork (from oDesk), they have begun to suck in spectacular ways. Their site is infested with bugs. Messages go missing all the time, it's no big deal. Notifications are not sent for new messages, payments, etc, it's kind of routine. Their site fails to load all too often.Worst of all, they have the lousiest IT and customer services people, who would just keep giving you lolly-pops without actually solving the problems. My last complaint has been pending with them for more than 2 months, and they have failed to resolve the issues. This was their technical side. Now, coming to the business. Ever since they merged with Elance, they have become the lousiest place to get work. I mean, I'm among their top 10% contractors. Yet, I hardly receive one invite in a couple of weeks. I need to send at least 50 applications before I get a single reply. Frankly, I'm lucky to have made some long term clients in the times of oDesk. Upwork is utter trash. Their CEO should get an award for screwing up a perfectly good website in a spectacular fashion.",0
"I tried to open a freelancer account. After I uploaded my picture to my profile, I received an email saying it violated their policy. Why? Because they didn't think it ""belonged"" to me. When I questioned further, and said in fact it was a photo of me, then uploaded another, different photo, I was sent a generic email and told to verify my identity by scanning and sending them several government-issued and other bank documents. Um, no. Stay away from this organization.",0
"I hired a Brainstorm Force in India who was dishonest with me and deceived me. I hired them to help me gain internet presence and rank higher on search engines but I found out that during the time I hired them, I was never listed with any search engines. No one could find me! I didn't pay this freelancer to have no one find me on the internet!! I couldn't believe it. I have proof that I was deceived by this freelancer and had to hire another company outside of Elance to fix this issue which is a big deal. I called Elance and tried to get my money back but their process for refunding my money after funds are released through escrow is nonexistent. Basically, you won't get your money back even if a freelancer deceived you and it was fraud! Even requesting for a refund after a job is closed is pretty much 0%. It is up to the freelancer to refund my money and I'm 100% sure they will not refund my money. Elance has no process for dealing with fraud after escrow is released and since I didn't know much about search engine optimization, I believed the freelancing company I hired. I believed they were doing their job to help me succeed and gain internet visibility. BIG MISTAKE ON MY PART. I'm just sorry I hired this freelancer and I'm even more sorry that I went through Elance. I just want to get my hard earned money back. Is there anything I can do to get my money back?",1
"Well, I have to say I have not been having good luck with freelancers. I posted a project on upwork.com and shortly after that I received an upbeat message from upwork.com saying ""XXXXX is a great fit for your job."" I had a quick look at the resume of XXXX and his experience looked great, hired him on the spot. Well since he had such a great reference from upwork I gave him the benefit of the doubt and let him bill a couple weeks of work without checking into it in much detail. Well $1100 later and none of the work is done. Reviewing his work log he was spending time looking for other freelancer jobs, browsing the net, not one screen of coding the features I was asking for. I cancelled the project immediately and wrote to upwork to check into it. They shrugged and said its been too long, I should have complained 'within the work week' which is four days. Lesson learned: Don't give upwork.com the benefit of the doubt with their suggestions, even if the candidate looks good there are scammers operating on their site.",1
"After contacting Elance to discuss a Freelancer who behaved, in my opinion, in a very unprofessional manner and supplying screenshots as requested, Elance informed me that they would most likely NOT provide me with the outcome of the review of the problem. Useful? No...",0
"Elance make obscure decisions. They argue that it's a safe marketplace, but that's not true. Suddenly, they can block your account stating that they do so just for safety. Even if you can recover it by going through an unnecessary ""verification"" process, you're not safe from those reviews. I have received twice warning emails telling that my account is under review, supposedly because one (or maybe more, not clear enough) customers were not happy. In a freelance site, the proves for customer satisfaction is the rating: I have a great rating, 4.6 (the .4 left, were just because 1 customer wasn't 100% satisfied with the cost). But, in the warning email Elance states that they ""take in consideration many other factors"", but they don't tell you what are those factors, not even the exact reason of the supposed ""unhappiness"". At the end of the email, they ""threat"" you and put in focus they have the power to shutdown your account. But you will never know why, even to improve your attention level in case they're right. Elance is not safe for freelancers. You can invest many years in this site, but they can shutdown your account without telling the reasons.",0
"Elance is a great site for you: lot of job, lower fees, fast payment processing... Until they lock your account for kind of ""suspicious"" action. First I have waited for two weeks and get an instruction: identify myself, update them and then wait for more instructions. I have identified myself, closed all working jobs, got feedback from clients... And here is another four weeks I'm waiting for instructions... They charged monthly fee, but has refunded it by my separate request. But I still unable to withdraw my funds. I really wonder, why they do it. While I'm under block, they might to get 150-200$ fees if I was able to work. And I'm not alone - how many money they loose?",0
"Overall, the service was great until they recently started monitoring your IP addresses. So what happened was that I have a business account with my partner. We both login to the account to perform different actions there. They noticed that 2 people(IPs) with different user names are logging into 1 account and put our account on hold in order to investigate. They had us send documents verifying our identities and even had skype intervews to make sure that we were real people. After I explained everything to them, they still told me that I need to agree not to do this in the future. I basically need to agree to not have multiple computers and devices accessing our business account! It's insane and they cause so much headache for some honest hardworking individuals. If you use the service, make sure you use a Tor browser. You will never have this issue.",0
"First thing to know about Elance is that there is no Elance vs Odesk. They are one company with the same owners. So your experience will be pretty similar - support..fees, pros and cons. That can be a good and bad thing. Their fees are: Site takes 8.75% fee for every project you complete. Elance fees have been raised last year from 6.75%. Fee's on earning $4k/month = $350. Plus $10/month if you want to use Elance actively and appear higher in search results. What I didnt enjoy most about Elance was that it isnot totally free if you don't join paid membership, you will keep feeling like you are using limited version of Elance. -- Great things about Elance of course is it's size, they take Escrow payments to ensure safety. And there are loads of helpful applications for accountability and communication. It's a great place for beginners and freelancers from third world countries. It isnt so good place for web professionals.. We did massive research about best 8 freelance marketplaces, compared their pros, cons, fees and how to make it out there.

"Been hiring freelancers through Elance for close to 3 years now. Found some great freelancers and some not so great freelancers, But my beef is with the site itself! It is full of bugs that cost me a lot of my time and it has been going on for a long time now. Today I looked through the site for a place to write to them about their bugs and to my surprise there was no way to contact them. No phone number, no email, no form to fill in. Or it was so well hidden that... But seriously, in this day and age you do that?",1
"I recently reactived a long-dormant account, and now I remember why I never really did any work for them.

Clients who want the absolute lowest price And Pulitzer Prize-winning content may need to rethink their priorities.",0
"For 2 1/2 years it has been fine. Evidently business is slow so now they are trying to extort more money from the contractors. That 'free' membership is no longer free. If you want to see how much competitors are bidding, you have to pay $10. They also said that companies would be identified by logos and individuals by photos. They are allowing companies from over seas to pass themselves off as individuals and accepting jobs that pay less than US minimum wage.",0

They take 20% of my earnings, while encouraging clients to pay as little as possible. However, I've met some great clients through their site, which is why they get an extra star or two as a review from me. Aside from their glitch-riddled software, they are a bad company. I've been an exemplary freelancer. Recently, they suspended my account, too, out of nowhere and for no reason. I squawked vehemently and they caved, but I really don't trust them. Recently also, a client (from India I think) refused to pay me. They made me jump through a lot of hoops only to declare that I violated their policy, so ""no protection for you!"" They gave no explanation and I didn't violate any of their stupid, micro-printed policies. It was just easier to let the client have his money back (if they did, in fact, give it back). Upwork claims to protect its freelancers, through some bogus ""contract protection."" It's a lie. You have to fight for your money when necessary and they are NOT on your side. It's really bad business since they seem to make most of their money by collecting a ""vig"" from our sweat, not the clients. Maybe you can connect successfully with good clients because Upwork takes our money and uses it for marketing to get lots of them. But, BE CAREFUL. Watch out for your money.
