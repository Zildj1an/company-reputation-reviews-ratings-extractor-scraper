0,"As a property owner listing my property on Airbnb for rentals, it’s a miserable, unfair, experience. They get payments wrong, pause your listing for various unfair or mistaken reasons, and are difficult to deal with. I recommend you stay away and use other major rental sites that I’m sure you’ve heard of. Those are fine, imo.",1,"Brian of Plano, TX"
1,"Airbnb is a total scam. They canceled my acct on vacation and left me living in the streets for complaining. The property I booked had no working plumbing, no working showers and no working toilets. Total scam. Using it you risk being robbed. They refuse to refund my stay and refuse to contact me back.",1,"Cayman of Los Angeles, CA"
2,airbnb decided to not go ahead with charges this time,1,"Serge of Monteregie, QC"
3,I booked at house in February and needed to cancel in March for a stay in August. The refund policy is very misleading. Cancel within 48 hours of booking and 14 days before check in to get full refund. Cancel up to 7 days before check in and get a 50 percent refund minus service charge. Cancel within 7 days of your trip and the reservation is non refundable. The host tells you they think you get back the amount. Airbnb tell you different. Service charges taken. Out of $393.28 I’m getting back $8.22 cents. ,1,"Sally of Calgary, AB"
4,"I canceled a reservation 60 days prior to a house with Strict cancellation policy. Guess what, I still have to refund from the host for money. The host told me that my cancellation excuse is ""lame"", and she has the right to decide not to refund my money. How ridiculous? What is the point with a definition of Strict cancellation policy? On AirBnb web page, it sad that ""cancellation before 14 days will get full refund except service fee"". AirBnb is getting worse and worse each year. I won't use it again.",1,"Zoe of Davis, CA"
5,"My first and only experience was horrible. I booked a house and made a down payment in January for a trip in March. There was an issue with payment because of my account being hacked into. They canceled my reservation without informing me that they were doing so. When I realized this days before our trip, I called and received the worst customer service in my life, specifically from Raven. They claimed that they emailed me to let me know but I never received it. They said I did not verify my email and that’s why. How were they able to take almost $400 from me if I hadn’t verified my email? ",1,"Tabatha of Saint Petersburg, FL"
6,Whatever you do don't book Airbnb. They cancelled my trip the day before and said I was locked out for security issues out of the blue the day before. I wish I read the reviews first. I now not only have to find a place for myself but my whole crew.,1,"Joseph of Myrtle Beach, SC"
7,"My first experience with Airbnb was one of a bait and switch tactic. Instead of a hotel, I decided to stay in an apartment. The rate was $201 per night. During the booking process, the rate increased to $250 per night. Luckily, I double checked everything before submitting payment. I ended up booking the reservation through another well known website for the original price of $201 per night, plus I saved a little due to the booking fees being lower. Since, I've received multiple emails from Airbnb encouraging me to complete the booking even though it's no longer available. I'm very disappointed and don't understand why companies participate in such unethical practices.",1,"Dawn of Birmingham, AL"
8,"After months of struggling with Airbnb...I gave up and then easily booked my vacation at VRBO! No more shock and disappointment discovering the difference between Airbnb’s hosts’ posted and actual price of rentals! No more delayed, confusing communications from hosts’ reneging on pricing and rental availability! And perhaps best of all no more suffering through Airbnb’s so called customer reps insisting that hosts are too busy to post accurate information and renters just need to waste as much time as it takes trying to get accurate rental info or who arbitrarily cancel an Airbnb customer’s account because the customer objects to such a woefully lacking customer service model. ",1,"ME of League City, TX"
9,"This is my first time using Airbnb to book my vacation. Me and my sister two family of 8 people planning a 6 nights trips in Las Vegas for the spring break. I had made a reservation through Airbnb on December 28 2018, for apartment in downtown Las Vegas from April 13th to April 19th 2019. 5 days later, my sister told me, she doesn’t want to go on the road trip no more, cause there are too much driving for her. So I hurry up and canceled the reservation, but they said the cancellation policy is very strict, you may cancel the reservation within 48 hours and 14 days before check in to get a full refund. It is very tricky, I canceled my reservation 100 days before I check in but they still charged me 50 percent of my deposit which is $468.75. Cause I didn’t meet the “within 48 hours.“ ",1,"Syndia of San Leandro, CA"
10,"My family members came from as far Guam and from Portland Oregon. I rented a property in Marina Del Rey CA for 3 days. Cost was $2,500. Check-in time was 4:00PM 02/22/19, host provided us with the wrong lockbox code, we tried contacting host @ 4:10pm unsuccessful, we reported the problem to Airbnb @ 4:15pm, Airbnb said they would contact the host but we were obligated to give the host 1 hr. to respond. Airbnb associate said that if there was no response in 1 hr. from 4:42pm, they would give us a full refund, the reservation would be cancelled, they would help us find another property and the host would lose their ""Super Host"" status. ",1,"Ramona of Los Angeles, CA"
11,"Airbnb.com says that you can cancel a booking and get full refund, or free of charge, if you cancel your booking before 48 hours, or within 48 hours of booking. Well, I am trying to cancel a 28 day booking I made in Budapest, but I am starting to get a really bad feeling about this host. I am afraid this host might be a scam, and I didn't want to risk getting to a faraway land in a country I’ve never been before, and risk not being able to get in the apartment with a child. I changed my mind and I was thinking to stay in another city instead, but since I paid $792.00 I wanted to get a refund so I could use it for another booking in another city. But airbnb.com website is telling me that my full refund (in less than 48 hours of booking) will be only $64.00. This company airbnb.com is a scam. Please be aware.",1,"Alexandra of Issaquah, WA"
12,"I canceled a rental and they initiated a refund which I have not received. I have been waiting for my refund for 3 months now. I called to speak to the department handling the refund ""processing center"" but customer service told me I could not be connected to them and they did not take phone calls. Only via their chat support. I keep getting the run @ and it's so inconvenient! Don't use them! They will steal your money!",1,"nora of Humble, TX"
13,"Their famous service does not equal to their customer support. Definitely the worst I've encounter yet! I was just asking them to delete my account since I have the right to have my personal information removed. Instead, what I received was rude agents and they only ""deactivate"" my account. No further help or respond was provided. Be careful and beware!!!",1,"Rayner of Vancouver, BC"
14,"Do not book through this site, they are a rip off and will do nothing to help WHEN not if things go wrong. Please don't waste your hard earned money. No customer service whatsoever - very rude staff.",1,James of United Kingdom
15,Recently rented a place and the owner kept my deposit saying that we scratched his fridge door yet we are positive it was his cleaner. He charged us $300 for a scratch and AirBNB allowed him to do this even though he never repaired the scratch. He got a fake quote and they allowed it. I have only gotten great reviews and am always very careful. AirBNB refused to keep open communication with me and immediately charged my credit card.,1,"Rhonda of Honolulu, HI"
16,"I called in August regarding issues on my account not letting me book a place. I’ve called multiple times, and have not received a callback. Have been told there’s technical difficulties and that’s why they haven’t called back... So there’s been technical difficulties for 7 MONTHS?!",1,"Michael of Phoenix, AZ"
17,"I had booked a condo in the middle of June for a December vacation. My wife and I were already in Huatulco when the host cancelled on us two days prior to moving into the condo. Airbnb gave me a $92.00 credit to put towards another property. With only two days before we required a place to stay I booked another property which ended up being 6 times the original booking. I have read and re-read their policies on Host cancellations and have been going back and forth with Airbnb to get this resolved. I am going on three months now and they keep putting it to a different customer care department. I have copied all my correspondences with them and have shown them their own policies in regards to a Host cancellation. Just wish that they would come forward and say, ""Sorry we were wrong and here is your refund."" For a company that brags about its platform being built on trust they certainly don't follow through.",1,David of Other
18,"Beware of Airbnb. Airbnb does not physically review any existing Homestay in the Airbnb site. Hence, there are homestay which might not be there at all. Host of Homestay Beware. Airbnb confirmed and accepted a reservation for my homestay. That means that guest have paid and good for check in. Guest check in on 14 Feb 2019 and check out on 16 Feb 2019. I notice that the particular payout was not been process in my Airbnb Host Dashboard. ",1,"EB of Cambridge, MA"
19,You guys ** suck. Thanks to you all I’m in the middle of Miami sleeping in my car with 3 children and you guys don’t give a ** and I had a reservation since 10 days ago. Waited 10 hours and never had my issue solved. I ended up sleeping in my car without a restroom and in a lil but I will have to walk into McDonald's to wash my mouth like a bomb. Thanks for ruining my vacation/anniversary/Valentine’s weekend. I been taking videos of this incident and you all are going down. My lawyer will contact you all soon. ** YOU ALL.,1,"Giselle of Orlando, FL"
20,"January 31st 2019 I checked in to Airbnb rental and an hour after the host left I noticed my asthma was kicking in and I also noticed that there was black mold surrounding the bathtub. It was also starting to give me a slight headache. I left and was there 3 hours. Immediately notified The Host. He gave me no resolution so I contacted Airbnb to request my refund and I did it within their 24 hour time frame as stated on the refund policy. It took them 11 days and they have denied my refund request and now they have blocked my ability to contact the host or them. They have not responded to me as far as supplying housing an alternate or my money back and I am not able to contact them. I paid $2,421.46 for 30 days. ",1,"Erin of San Jose, CA"
21,"After making a reservation for what appeared to be a beautiful property, I learned that I am only renting a room in the condo and not the entire condo. When I called customer service to complain and cancel, they initially agreed to refund me all of my money but when it came time for the refund they would only refund half the amount saying it was what was fair to both me and the host. They are refusing to honor their commitment on the refund. This was the first and definitely last time I will ever use Airbnb!",1,"Denise of Cumming, GA"
22,"We rented a Sante Fe model home in Phoenix, Arizona for a family event. My 85 year old Mom wanted all her daughters and their families together in one house for the event, so we chose a larger model home that would sleep 8. When we entered the property, there were no directions for check-in or check-out, or how to use the Wifi or cable TV. There was old, opened food in the refrigerator and cabinets, beer bottles in the cushion of the sofa, exposed wires on the smoke detectors, missing batteries, and missing units, as well as closet doors that wouldn't open, AND cracked/raised tile in a bedroom that was a tripping hazard. ",1,"Barbara of Exton, PA"
23,"So I decided to try Airbnb for our vacation. It was not cheap, but we thought we would have a more comfortable stay than a hotel. MISTAKE! The place was not comfortable! The house was decorated in thrift store furniture. Living room was old wooden outdoor furniture. Not cozy to watch movies. The closets were packed with junk, like as hoarder. I had to rearrange for room for our clothes as there were no dressers.",1,"Pamela of Kintnersville, PA"
24,Updated on 02/09/2019: I just spoke to a James who told me he was supervisor who he claims is higher than case manager and pretended like he was going to help me with the fact that they keep playing with me and I am due to fly out in five hrs but instead of reimbursing me they think if they keep being polite while they steal from me it will be ok. I don't understand how they cancel my reservations hours before arrival then trick me into another reservation under false pretenses. Double cross me twice then expect me to trust them not to cancel on me again? Why? If I am too ** for your LA reservation I should be too ** for your Las Vegas reservation. I see some people still believe in slavery.,1,"Anthony of Dayton, OH"
25,"I will never use airbnb again for as long as i live. Absolutely disgraceful customer service. Literally the worst compnay I've ever dealt with in my life. So me and my partner are relocating from Melbourne to Sydney for work, we booked a lovely looking 1 bedroom apartmemt in Sydney's Olympic park for a week just to have time to look at apartments etc. ",1,Luk of Australia
26,"I'm ** and did an 'instant booking' through Airbnb for a Chicago trip in December. 'Instant booking' means you can book instantly without host's approval. Host (**) sent me a notice saying he misunderstood what 'instant booking' meant and that the booking was too short notice so he couldn't do it. I'm only giving it an extra star because of the nice customer service handling the problem and refunding my money, otherwise I'd give it one star. I don't think I will use this service again. I found a great hostel in Chicago (Chicago Hostel) where I could stay at the last minute. Great service and I had no problems or issues.",1,"Lawanda of Belleville, IL"
27,"I work for a trade show company in Southern California and we make frequent trips out to Las Vegas for various trade shows. There was a house that I saw that was available by a host named Andreas (From Los Angeles) that I wanted to book for my boss, myself, and my employees. So while I have this reserved, there were some things I had to change about the profile since it was a company profile under a former employee's name. While doing so our reservation was canceled and we were only offered a partial refund. I contacted the host about refunding the rest and he offered me a bogus special that was for $199 per night. Well, the original price was for about $150 per night. He also told me that he contacted Airbnb and they informed him that it was an error that caused the cancellation. So he was of no help to me.",1,"Mike of Santa Fe Springs, CA"
28,"Myself or our organisation will never use Airbnb again! We booked at Studio Villa Bali, located West of Denpasar, Bali and upon arrival the accommodation was nothing like how it was described. We also noted that the bedding was creased and upon further inspection, found foreign human hairs both under the covers and under the left side pillow. It was quite obvious the bedding was not freshly made and a serious hygiene issue. We checked out 4 days prior to the departure date because Airbnb help support failed to contact us to resolve the issue. ",1,"Mark of Bangkok, Thailand"
29,"This was our first and likely our last time reserving accommodation through Airbnb. The Airbnb advertising was very misleading and we were very disappointed in the accommodation. We had booked 2 weeks in the sun of Mazatlán, but because the accommodation was so disappointing we changed our return flight reservations and came home a week early, even though we had paid for a two week stay at the Balboa Apartments.",1,"Paul of Other, Canada"
30,"I live next door to an Airbnb and can't get any help from them on their website listings. These people have a 50' waterfront lot and are showing my 150' waterfront lots and my pier in their pictures, which I've had their guest trespassing on, even with the caption on the photo and no trespassing signs everywhere. They are also renting against deed restriction and have personally tried to intimidate me about what I'm doing on MY property, to reclaim the privacy they took out, that has been here for the past 24 years. ",1,"Hellen of Mabank, TX"
31,The Airbnb suite we rented was falsely advertised. We complained to Airbnb who contacted the host. The host arrived very confrontational and forced his solution on us. We decided not to give any review but the host reviewed us. He made false accusations regarding our concerns saying we were demanding and refused to pay for extra services.,1,"Rebecca of Canada, Canada"
32,"Booked through Airbnb, Result... Stayed in Miami 48 hours. No hot water. Host didn’t give a damn. Contacted Airbnb. Result they don’t give a damn. All they want is money. This company is a shame and should be closed down.",1,"Bobby of Other, Other"
33,"I have been dealing with them for a month now to resolve a refund issue. The account I used to purchase the stay has since been closed. I offered an alternative payment method at the start of refund process. They said no instead returned to the bank, who then returned it to them, as the account is closed. I have confirmed with letter from the bank that account is closed, and that there is no chargeback request for the charge, at which point I was directed to provide a new card for refund process. Two weeks later still waiting on refund. Managers are unwilling to reassign issue stating that only the person handling this matter can handle moving forward, but that person is continually out of office. What recourse does one have? I have never used this service before and I sure I never will in the future.",1,"Kimberly of Atlanta, GA"
34,I rented a cabin at Broken Bow that said free refund within their guidelines. Due to personal reasons I had to cancel within a reasonable time frame. Then all I got was a run around by Airbnb from Christine and Rex. They just want their cut and if anything goes wrong they refuse to help. They told me if I did a bad review they would release my personal info. I consider that a threat.,1,"Larry of Allen, TX"
35,"I apparently did something wrong and got my access to the site revoked. To my knowledge, no complaints or bad reviews. I didn't ever leave negative reviews and had an overall good experience the 4 times I used the site. While requesting to book my honeymoon cabin, I was told my access was revoked and my account temporarily suspended. I called and I emailed to find out what I had done. A week later, I received an email saying my account was permanently closed and that they did not need to tell me why. Pretty ridiculous to not even explain how I had violated whatever policy lead to being deactivated. We booked an awesome place through VRBO. Airbnb is a dime a dozen. I'm happy to give my money to another company.",1,"M of Phoenix, AZ"
36,"This site has hidden parameters that have limitations. One of which is the use of their gift cards. Paid down payment for rental in Puyallup WA with CC and then family members wanted to help with the trip and gifted us a gift card. Loaded it onto the site then find out you can't use it unless it was for the first payment. What kind of policy is this?! So not only is the $400 dollar gift card stuck (we can't sell it or get rid of it) we have to use on another trip using AIRBNB which will be the very last time we use them. Our mistake is we should have read reviews of this organization prior to using. VBRO is much better, used them a couple of time with great success. Will recommend the homeowner to do the same as this company is out to screw the renter...",1,"Ted of Swanton, OH"
37,"Last summer 2018 I had an Airbnb guest for over two months at my apartment. Knowing it was going to be a long stay, I called Airbnb prior, to let them know I was concerned about the utilities being included in the price. Utilities are paid per use and it is hard to anticipate what the guest will be using, mainly in summer with AC units. Airbnb told me not to worry because I would be covered by their standard agreement. After the guest had left, I received the electrical bill and it was 3 times more than what I had anticipated. I brought it up to Airbnb and the only thing they had to say was they are sorry but the security deposit can not be applied to utilities. Utilities are always included in the price. How are we supposed to estimate the electrical use for extended stays? It does not feel fair to estimate a really high number and make some people overpay.",1,"Yolanda of New York, NY"
38,"I've been booking apartments in Europe for this summer o Airbnb. It takes a lot of time to find the right place. After a couple of weeks, I receive a message, saying they just canceled my reservation, no explanation. It happened 3 times. It's frustrating. They shouldn't allow that to happen. No doubt I will book using Booking.com from now on, you can rely on that company.",1,"Silvia of Other, Other"
39,"I host was manipulated with the photo posted to the profile to mislead customers. I shared my feedback with Airbnb Support. They compensated me at the checkout by 15% refund of the fees. One day later, the host raised a claim against the security deposit. Claiming that I had smoked in the apartment and the key was not in the lockbox. He photoed the apartment after my checkout time, he put leftover of cigarettes and tobacco everywhere in the apartment. He shared this photo with Airbnb.",1,"Khaled of Jackson Heights, NY"
40,"On January 1/24/19 I made a reservation using Airbnb, this was a late reservation at a place I was not familiar with (Bedfordview, Johannesburg, Nico Hotel). The reservation order was simple but it was what happened that left me disgruntled. My guest who I had an argument with stormed out the room and damaged tiles on the apartment front door. I then reached out to the host to get assistance and get the police involved, this instead was the beginning of the nightmare. Instead the residential security approached me, instead of asking what had happened or what is going on they were aggressive and instead choose to attack me, next thing I know I have been sucker punched the aggressor running away.",1,"Tinashe of Irving, TX"
41,"I needed to spend 3 months in Albuquerque, NM in 2019. I booked my stay at The Whoozle House which was hosted by Mark ** through Airbnb for January 29 through April 28, 2019. The booking was made and paid for on September 2018. During the interim I continued to confirm my reservation with the host and he said it was on. When I arrived after a 13 hour flight from overseas I called the host to inform him of my arrival date and time in Albuquerque and get directions for picking up the key. He acted like he wasn't even aware of my reservation. After a bit of conversation he remembered and then he told me he was sorry it was already rented out. I reminded him that we had a confirmed paid reservation. He wasn't concerned and had no remorse about breaking the contract and failing to notify me.",1,"Kerry of El Cajon, CA"
42,"I'm a single female living alone and I Airbnb my guest room. I had my listing set to auto book so that guests can automatically book and got several STRANGE people with questionable pictures, profile pictures that were not of them, disturbing messages, and people with terrible reviews. Like literally a guy wanted to be a nudist in my home and when I asked him if he was serious he tried to start an argument with me, ""Is this funny? Why do you think this is funny?"" YEESH! SCARY! I don't want him in my house! No thank you! I was able to cancel these auto books, but only got 3 cancellations allowed per year! ",1,"Sara of Chicago, IL"
43,"I had two reservations cancelled at the last minute in Tokyo. As part of my refund, Airbnb issued me approximately $3,500 in credit which they told me I could use for future stays at Airbnb. I used up a little less than $800 for a stay in New York and another $300 for a stay in Boston. Today, when I went to make another reservation, I was told by Airbnb that the $3,500 in credits were actually two individual coupons, one for $1,500 and another for $2,000 -- and that each could only be applied once. This was the first mention of this and essentially they're telling me I blew the vast part of my credit by using it for short term stays. NEVER did they mention this. Buyer beware on any and all transactions with this company.",1,"John of San Diego, CA"
44,The matter first began when Airbnb froze payment on my account. I opened a simple ticket to inquire why. First Airbnb said I had to fill out a US tax account form. This was false as I am in Canada. I spent time and money trying to resolve the matter based on this false advice. Next Airbnb said I needed to become a business and provide my business details. Again I investigated. This was also false. Lastly it was a simple matter unrelated to what Airbnb support told me. I then asked to escalate this horrible matter when I was given blatantly false information and to be given a chance to provide feedback on the specific conversation.,1,Ben of Canada
45,"We will never use this dishonest, greedy, immoral company again. Airbnb rented us an illicit rental apartment in an Atlanta apartment complex. As we found out once we were there, the complex does not allow Airbnb rentals. The host gave us and dozens of other Airbnb renters the security code to the front gate of the private complex and access to all the complex facilities. We were kicked out of the apartment. I notified Airbnb that the host is not allowed to rent out her apartment in this complex and that I want a refund. Airbnb refused to refund ANY of our payment. I gave them the number for the main office in the complex. Not only did Airbnb not bother calling the complex, they continued allowing the host to rent the apartment, knowing full well that the rental is illicit.",1,"Karen of South Orange, NJ"
46,"Airbnb is a waste of money. The house I rented was a dump ie: Dirty, broken items, non-working toilets, heater, hot water and misrepresented in the ad. When I tried to resolve with Airbnb they were not interested in my story! Even though they are allowing someone to post a picture advertising the microwave in the bathroom which by the way the toilet twice over-flowed with poop! DISGUSTING. This was not looked into, in fact I called twice to speak to a Supervisor and asked to be contacted by phone. Instead got an email, very unprofessional. They don't care and their service is below standard. I will never use them nor recommend!",1,"Patricia of San Jose, CA"
47,"I had guests do several thousand dollars worth of damage to my property. After I documented the damage and sent Airbnb an invoice then the excuses started for them not to pay. I then requested if I go to the trouble of attaining more quotes would they honor their host guarantee. Their support contact got rude, dismissive and offensive. Then I read the dozens of the same complaints I had similar in that Airbnb will not honor a host guarantee. It is a scam. WHY HAS THE ACC AND FAIR TRADING DONE NOTHING IN SUPPORT OF AUSTRALIANS BEING AFFECTED BY THIS COMPANY. ALL MONEY GOES OUT OF AUSTRALIA.",1,"Andrew of Other, Australia"
48,"I am host in Tokyo, Japan and Airbnb don't make payout as per the terms and conditions. They don't even care to call or send email. When I call they make all stupid excuses and the representative who works are rude. I don't think Airbnb should be allowed to do IPO.",1,Yash of Japan
49,"Upon entering ** establishment at 11 Sexton Cove Rd, Key Largo, FL we smelled mold. A surveillance camera is pointed at the deck where you hang out, which also views into the living room. Plan on being watched during your vacation! While sitting on the deck you will get eaten by fleas and chiggers. Be careful of the stones in their driveway because my kids found 4 long rusty nails and several cigarette butts. There were even a few teeth cleaning picks out there to look at. Cleaning crew did not do that good of a job. A cockroach was seen in the kitchen and bathroom only on 2 occasions, which is not too bad for being Florida. ",1,"Cathylia of Tobyhanna, PA"
50,"Our group checked into an Airbnb property that was completely misrepresented by the host. The Airbnb escalation representative was not at all fair and helpful. The property was not even close to as described on the listing from number of bedrooms, to number of beds, to the properties views. As asked I provided photos of the lack of queen bed, lack of bedrooms, and lack of the view of the mountain as pictured. Check in process was not as described and we had dirty linens.

51,"Last week we received our 5th consecutive Super Host rating by Airbnb. Then today I received a notice that our service was being truncated immediately on 2 listings we have, without any opportunity to access tax and payment related records stored by Airbnb for which we paid fees to have them maintained.

52,"We booked our vacation home through Airbnb for a house in the Orlando, FL area. After driving 21 hours from Toronto Canada, our host canceled the booking on our arrival date due to maintenance issues. I was thankful that the host notified me in advance, but was very disappointed when Airbnb staff were unwilling to provide me with a comparable accommodation for our trip. We planned our vacation months in advance, and AirBnb's suggestions for alternate accommodations required me to pay thousands of dollars more than originally paid. We ended up canceling for a refund and booked with a hotel brand that we trust. I will never book with Airbnb when it comes to my family again.",1,David of Canada
53,"I have been a host for approximately 7 years and get all 5 stars most of the time in my reviews. I recently had some guests who trashed my home, didn't follow my rules and disrespected my neighbors. Airbnb was able to get some money back for me for the repairs and replacement of some items that got broken but in retaliation, the guests left me a horrible review even though they signed my guestbook and raved about my home. They made many accusations and told many lies in this review. I asked Airbnb to take it down since it was clear that they were was seeking justice for losing their deposit. Airbnb refused to take the review down. That being said, it greatly impacted my business. Should I have a guest to stay in the future and does any damage or something comes up missing, I am afraid to say anything because I don't want to get a fake review.",1,"Darlene of Nashville, TN"
54,"Worst customer service! They route the call to Philippines and none of them know how to answer any questions. All they do is reading scripts. Airbnb is robbery in a modern world. Airbnb doesn’t understand that life happens and circumstances can change. I canceled my trip 2 months ahead! I should be getting full refund! The customer service doesn’t understand HIPAA! And asked for letter from doctor. Hello! You can just Google the name of the doctor and bam your privacy is out of the window! I received a confirmation that my refund of $336 is on its way! I just need to know when, and none of the customer support aka Case Manager can answer it.",1,"Dale of San Francisco, CA"
55,"I just tried to book a place and after paying, was prompted to verify my identity with the last 4 digits of my Social Security number along with full name and date of birth, I input the information and it told me it was incorrect (twice). I called the help number since I legally changed my name last month and maybe they haven't updated their system. They had me send a photo of my SS card and I blocked out the first 5 numbers with the last four digits clearing visible along with my full name. This should have been sufficient to confirm my ID but then the Airbnb rep I was speaking with asked me to resend a picture of my SS card with all the numbers visible! Very sketchy Airbnb! I said I would not share the full number and their only solution for me was to have someone else book the reservation on my behalf. Will not use Airbnb next time if they are going to require me to share all my confidential info with an overseas third party screening company.",1,"Molly of Coronado, CA"
56,"I rented lodging through Airbnb in Belize. The manager started running scams on me, and I vacated the (not very nice) facilities and settled up with the owner, including paying an early cancellation fee and getting a document from the owner that all disputes had been settled. Three days later a new charge showed up on my credit card showing a $150 charge from them. They blame the owner. The owner says I have to work through them, and I'm still working on getting that charge reversed, 3 months later. These guys are rip off artists. Never, ever again.",1,"David of Plano, TX"
57,The house we rented through Airbnb was nasty with some blood and with spots on duvets and bed sheets. Towels were never cleaned and condoms under the couch. I forward all the photos to them and asked for a refund and their response was what I provided wasn’t enough. Never again.,1,"Amin of Northridge, CA"
58,"Airbnb is a nightmare of a company. After walking into a loft that was vacated by Airbnb guests I was confronted with a bed that a guest had vomited and defecated on. In an attempt to conceal the damages, the guest wrapped the soiled sheets in clean towels, turned the pillow cases inside out, and ""made the bed"" with the soiled duvet. Upon check out, the house rules convey guests need to report any damages (not once has a guest stepped up for obvious damage) among other things that need to be tended to, like locking up. Guest did not lock the door and so I had to send someone over to lock up. Had the guest revealed what had happened, steps of sanitation would have been implemented.",1,"James of San Diego, CA"
59,"My wife and I rented an Airbnb in Stavanger, Norway. The place literally made us both ill. There were rats, mold in the walls, mold in the wooden floor, furniture destroyed, appliances broken, no vacuum cleaner, bathroom illegally installed so rats had direct access to the unit, no lock on the entrance door. When we made Airbnb aware of the place we told them that we had both developed respiratory problems and headaches their reply was that this is not sufficient for a refund!!!",1,Michael of Norway
60,"I had a situation where I rented a house under specific ""house Rules"" and ""Security Deposit Amt."" The agreement was made ~2 months prior to rental. ~2.5 weeks prior to our rental date the owner changed the ""house rules,"" notifying us that there would be surveillance cameras inside the house and the security deposit was changed from $2000 to $3000. I had full documentation of the original terms of the rental agreement as well as the changes made. AirBNB customer service reps (located outside of the U.S.) neither understood Airbnb's own policies nor did they care about the violation of the renter. I tried speaking with reps from within the U.S. The company is extremely chaotic. Could never speak with same reps twice. It was a nightmare. I lost $1260.00. I WILL NEVER USE AIRBNB'S SERVICE AGAIN SO LONG AS I RESIDE ON THIS EARTH SO HELP ME GOD! They are a sham!",1,"Patrick of Sayville, NY"
61,"I’ve been hosting using Airbnb the last couple months and find the app and company policies to be quite unfair for us hosts. For example, anytime someone has an inquiry/question you as a host must pre-approve them staying with you in order to avoid penalties. I have had several guests ask to park at my place for up to 3 weeks while they travel & only book 1 night at my place. ",1,"M of City,City"
62,"Fist of all Airbnb did not follow their company refund policy to issue my refund. Second of all, the case manager erased all the communication record between me and her in my personal profile of Airbnb!!!! Third of all, Airbnb case manager refuse to post my review to the host SPI Rental South Padre Island which steals $1556.17 from me without providing a safe environment and created lots of issues which qualified for the refund to customers based on Airbnb refund policy. I spent two horrible night there and was charged for $1556.17. Airbnb helps those treating and disgusting host to fool customers to rent from Airbnb. Airbnb prevented a customer to review the terrible host and just put the good review for the terrible to help them fool people and make their commission fee!!!",1,"Emily of Pearland, TX"
63,"We rented a condo a month ahead of time. When we arrived, the lockbox code did not work. We called the host... Long voicemail saying he was out of town... Voice mailbox was full. Left text for host... no response after an hour. Called Airbnb... was on hold for 50 minutes. Agent said he would try to call host. Agent called back in 15 minutes saying that the host had finally answered but had then hung up on the agent! The agent canceled our reservation on the spot and said the host has the right to cancel at any time!! This is not the first time an Airbnb host has canceled at the last minute. I find that VRBO and HomeAway are much more professional and reliable and will continue to use them in the future.",1,"Jill of Greenville, SC"
64,"I am saddened to share my terrible experience with the Airbnb hosts. I have never ever in my entire life of traveling experience such terrible people. I made a booking from AIRBNB and their system allowed me to book, pay and everything. My greatest unpleasant surprise was to find out that the first host has no house available for me and my family,",1,"akhona of Other, OTHER"
65,So Airbnb likes to ** with people too much. I normally don’t care to write reviews but I’ve had too much trouble with Airbnb and I just want everyone to know that they are the worst company. Let me tell you how. Bear with me because this is a long issue I’m about to complain about. In 2017 around June or July a friend and I took a trip to California. On the way to California about 2 hours out our Airbnb was cancelled. We felt with Airbnb for a long time and had a huge issue with customer service so we were told we would receive a credit for our next stay. Now this is a whole issue I’m not about to get into because it has nothing to do with this current issue but I want you to know before I took my trip on 11/14/2018 I called Airbnb since I never received credit from my trip in 2017. I called and they gave me 100$ credit FOR MY TROUBLES in 2017. Keep that in mind.,1,"Naturally of Scottsdale, AZ"
66,"We recently rented an apartment in Barcelona Spain, and the experience wasn't good at all, neither the support from Airbnb. The apartment was dirty, no sheets, no towels and the AC did not work. It is really frustrated and unfortunate for most customers as I went through the reviews here. Airbnb seems to care only about the money from the host and they take the side of the host, no matter what they say, I realize that they can say anything, and that is really troubling, not fair and not right at all, and gives you with a bad taste and awful experience that makes you question choosing Airbnb again.",1,"Belinda of Oviedo, FL"
67,"Airbnb warning. Just a warning that not all hosts are honest. I recently booked a home in Isla Mujeres in Mexico for the month of February and luckily enough was in Mexico in December and took a day out of my vacation to check out the rental. We hired a local cab driver to help us find the property. We not only never found the house but the street it was supposed to be on was in a slum and garbage lined the streets, bars on all the windows, nothing even close to the picture on the Airbnb listing. ",1,Antje of Canada
68,"If you are looking for renting a property through this booking site please read carefully and be aware. Hidden fees - The prices listed seem to be lower compared to some hotels, but that is misleading. Once you get to the check out you all of sudden notice that 1. They charge you booking fee for every day you book - that seems to be % of your booking so it can add up to $80-$100 extra. 2. Many hosts will charge you cleaning fee $30-$35. 3. Many hosts will want you to also pay for electricity and water. 4. Add to that you get no daily service. 5. No free breakfast. 6. No airport shuttle. 7. No 24 hrs front desk service since the host lives usually quite far or in different country. All added up you pay a lot more for the booking than in the hotel.",1,"Michael of Columbia, SC"
69,I have used AirBnB quite often and never had a complaint. This time the apartment we rented was not owned or rented by the host who listed it on the site. Someone else was occupying it. Seems it was a fraud case. While I had no issues with the AirBnB agent who was forthcoming and supportive it took us nearly two hours to get someone on the phone or chat. All three travelers were trying to contact AirBnB by phone and chat. Every time the system or someone (?) hung up after 40 to 60 minutes of listening to that awful music. Basically if you have a problem you are on your own. After nearly two hours we finally got someone on the line who authorized us to take a hotel which would be reimbursed. I hope that works.,1,"Udo of Denver, CO"
70,"I recently stayed at a room in a private home, with a shared bathroom and the experience wasn't good at all, neither the support from Airbnb, and it is really frustrated and unfortunate for most customers as I went through the reviews here.

71,"The experience overall was good as a host, But I do have an issue with not being informed/alerted that I had to provide an identity to withdraw the money! It's basically hidden info on the site while it should be very clear to me before I proceed to have a guest in my house. It's been a few months and the guest is gone and I still can't receive my money (That I started the whole thing because I was in need of it at that time), I can't do that because I don't own a passport and that's the only option they gave me to prove my identity so they made it even harder for me! That's an issue or that's what I think is an issue.",1,"Moustafa of Other, OTHER"
72,"We appreciate the beauty of the home and look forward to returning again. Our reservation was for the master bedroom. It had 2 queen beds and a private bathroom. It was very clean, and the host was very considerate.",1,"C.R. of Hudson, Florida"
73,"An Airbnb host cancels unexpected two days prior to the check-in date for a family New Year's celebration. When ""working"" for over four hours with the Airbnb Customer Service, all of whom are shocked that the limited comps are so expensive so close to a major holiday. Airbnb provided poor alternatives for a family trip, stating that other options were too expensive. Their solution was to receive a partial reimbursement after the fact. Not to mention this was after four LONG phone calls and four hours of nothingness. I expected more. My fault for assuming anything good from Airbnb.",1,"Sean of Saint Louis, MO"
74,"I stayed in an Airbnb in this Nov 2018 for 16 days in a house in Canada, Toronto, Pintail Cres. The host entered my room without permission 3 times, or more. The host's wife, Olxa, informed me at night that the host Darxn was in my room to unplug my MP3 Player. There is no advanced notification for permission to enter my room. On the second last day of my stay, when I came back at night, I found a gift paper wrapped cookie on my desk. Nobody asked for permission to enter the room or notified me after the entering up to this Dec 22, 2018. My concern is that that day I was rushed out for training and forgot to lock my luggage which has my passport, ID cards, credit cards etc important personal info.",1,"Candie of San Jose, CA"
75,"I have been using Airbnb since 2016. Every time I encountered a problem, Airbnb takes the side of the host irrespective of the circumstances. They also hide or delete bad reviews at the request by the host. My recent experience was, I arrived at this house to find out the place is dirty and had cutlery with food particles on them. The floor infested with ants and there were a few flies, those large ones that appear during summer, in the house. The house was facing the host's backyard and the place was a mess. Due to these shortcomings I immediately notified Airbnb after attempting to contact the host. The Airbnb contacted the host. When the host arrived at the property, they were visibly upset and appeared aggressive. They tried to pick an argument which I tried hard to avoid, which made me really uncomfortable and felt threatened at the time. I was alone at their property and anything could happen when someone is upset.",1,Upul of Australia
76,They advertise that you can get a refund within 14 days before check-in. Please read the fine print because they don't. They have you pay for half the duration e.g 5 days if you will stay for 10 days. If you cancel after 38 hours but within the 14 days you get nothing back and they still advertise for the days you have paid for that you didn't get a refund. Talk about double payment.,1,Fibi of Other
77,"We have a trip planned in a week and just received a text cancelling our rental. They offer to refund our money, but getting something in a strange place with one week's notice is not easy. Not only are places more expensive with such short notice, we cannot get a great place for our vacation and have to settle for whatever we can get. Such a disappointment. How is this acceptable when we rented the place two months ago. No apology or explanation. I WILL NEVER TRUST THIS SERVICE AGAIN.",1,"Deborah of Reno, NV"
78,"We had booked a cabin for 12/28/2018-12/30/2018. Just two weeks before our trip, the host calls that the cabin isn’t available anymore due to the owners selling it, and not giving a 60 day notice. Just two weeks before my family arrives from Florida expecting a cabin, and in the busiest day of the year. There were no other selections in our price range so we don’t get any other cabin for that date due to the others being more expensive. Instead we get a measly credit of $101 for another booking, yet there are none left. This ruined our trip, especially since my family has been going through a hard time lately, and me and my wife wanted to treat them to a relaxing getaway. ",1,"M. of Dayton, TN"
79,I was visiting Lima Peru and booked a 1 bedroom apartment through Airbnb. (I have used my account with Airbnb in the past without any issue.) Upon arrival I was handed the keys from the landlord. She immediately explained the apartment wasn’t ready at the moment which was fine because I wasn’t going to be returning until The evening So I took the keys and left. I returned around 7 pm with my belongings and noticed the apartment was dirty particularly the bathroom since it clearly showed signs that it hadn’t been cleaned. There was a half used soap in the soap holder of the shower and a very dirty white rug to put your feet on after a shower. There was also no hand soap at all by the sink and there was one hand towel that was moist as if it had already been used. ,1,"Sandra of Hallandale, FL"
80,The assigned case manager hasn't contacted me for almost 24 hours on a time sensitive issue! They only care about making money and they usually side with the host. To them all guests are liars that leave false reviews. Don't expect them to take care of you. I won't be booking ever again.,1,"Wendy of Cupertino, CA"
81,MY AIRBNB ACCOUNT WAS DISABLED FOR NO VALID REASON!!! I was a regular Airbnb user for years until they put my account under review. I've been waiting since about December 2016 for a response on why my account was disabled. I've emailed & called them several times over the wait. They just sent a response December 2018. (TWO YEARS LATER!) Companies love throwing their 'terms of service' at you & telling you what they're not liable for when they are being **. Simply to remind you that they don't care about your frustrations & they are not there for you. ** AIRBNB!,1,"Ian of Brooklyn, NY"
82,"I booked a night's stay at Shinjuku for my young daughter and I on 24 Nov 18. When we reached the apartment and could not get in and after we tried getting in touch with the host without any success, we contacted Airbnb. The next thing I knew, I received an email informing me that my reservation has been canceled and that I would be refunded. I was left stranded with my daughter in the middle of winter and with most hotels fully booked, I had limited choice.",1,"Freddie of City,City"
83,"My husband booked an apartment on 8 Ave Macmahon near Arc de Triomphe. We are traveling with our 2 kids. On 8th December after the Paris violent protests, we asked for a cancellation and requested to change our booking to a safer location on 29 Dec. The roads to Ave Macmahon were blocked and metros around there were closed on 8 Dec. Tear gas and water cannons were fired right outside this apartment! After 3 days of email and multiple phone calls Airbnb has denied us a change even though we highlighted that it was unsafe especially for the kids. On their Airbnb website they have listed violence, inaccessibility and safety hazard as conditions for refund. Shouldn't they honor it? Their reply is, ""The host has refused a refund!""",1,Lim of Singapore
84,"They're a worst. I booked a trip like 5 days ahead. I wanted to cancel it the next day, which is still within 48 hour, since my schedule changed. They won't give me full refund, only 50% of it; they said the cancellation has to be within 48 hours AND 14 days ahead. How stupid is that? How can I have 14 days notice if I just book a room for a trip next week? They told me to go talk to the host as they can't do anything. I wish they're out of business soon. Heard they said they would go public, pray lord. The most irresponsible business model in the world. Use Booking.com instead. They help you cancel full refund even though it's not stated when you booked.",1,"Merry of Sugar Land, TX"
85,"My experience with Airbnb had been ok for approx 2 1/2 years until I had a bad renter which resulted in over $3,000 worth of damages to my home. The people were doing drugs, damaged multiple things in my home, had been smoking (many things-legal and illegal), had a pet despite the 'NO PET' policy and finally flooded my downstairs bathroom, damaging the wood flooring, the toilet and the door (locked it from the inside without a way to get in without removing the door).

86,"Updated on 03/08/2019: I am currently in the dispute between Airbnb and my credit card company because I stayed at a location in California that had roaches and the Airbnb tried to offer me 50% back. Capital One is trying to stick me with the full amount, even though Airbnb allows the host to not only insult guests that have stayed at her house, but also scam people with her rental, as there are numerous reviews stating that the host has roaches in her rental property. The fact that Airbnb allows this is beyond ridiculous, and Airbnb doesn't take care of its customers. They're in it for the host to rent locations to guests, sight unseen, fake pictures, fake reviews, unsafe locations, and unsanitary situations. Don't waste your money. Get a hotel room, you'll be way better off.",1,"Kristy of Burbank, IL"
87,"I raised a complaint to the Airbnb customer support team regarding a discriminatory review that I faced with my host. The latter made rude comments about me and gave me a bad public review.

88,"Frankly, I only knew Airbnb from my bookings, and I never had any experience with Airbnb Resolution team until their online agent, Ronie's, recently helped me very quickly and to my satisfaction, and that impressed me, but today another agent, Alexandre, truly ""knocked off my socks"" with instant and tremendously caring quality customer care on a different issue. I can't overestimate that! Now I know that Airbnb is much more than just a place to stay but also a place filled with wonderful and caring people. First-rate service!",1,"David of Indian Creek, IL"
89,"I rented a place through Airbnb and right before the trip I saw a couple new reviews stating that people had issues with cockroaches. I contacted Airbnb and they told me they were false reviews and I had nothing to worry about. They assured me that if I saw any when I checked in that they would move us. We checked in and we started seeing them everywhere!!! I contacted them and not only did they not move us but they only refunded $120 of the $950 we paid! We had to spend the trip in a cockroach infested place. I called, asked to speak to a manager and they did not care. They closed the case and told me it was my choice to stay there. I have used Airbnb for years and I cannot believe how they treated this situation.",1,"Sarah of Martinez, CA"
90,I booked a condo for a week in the Philippines and when we arrived to the condo it smelled like mold. The smell was really bad. I left immediately. Could not stay in an apartment that smelled so bad. I contacted Airbnb and asked for a refund. They were on the side of the host and only refunded me half. They did not protect me and were more on the side of the host. I posted a bad review about the host and it was never posted. There was no bad language used just being honest about my experience and it was not posted. No wonder the host has so many good reviews and no negative. I will not trust Airbnb anymore. It's a gamble. Imagine traveling far away and when you get there it's not what you expected. Who has your back because Airbnb won't.,1,"Hector of Union City, NJ"
91,"Airbnb contacted me about a dissatisfied guest who thought the radiators were non-functioning. They suggested I offer her some money to appease her unless I could provide a plumber's note contradicting her experience. I told them that yes I ""would"" refund if they offered me some assurances as a host that I would be protected from guests making up stories for refunds. They declined to protect the host saying guest are free to say what they please so long as they aren't racist. I then explained I was not going to offer the guest money and instead provided Airbnb the plumber's note confirming the radiators were working and the house was above average hot, on top of which the guest had left windows open.

92,"Why are there so few negative reviews on Airbnb? Does Airbnb delete them? I haven't seen any after viewing a lot of locations. Just today, I wrote a bad review on Airbnb for an awful host and it was removed within the hour. I didn't break the guidelines, they didn't give me a valid reason for removing my review. I just guess that only good reviews sell. That is why I chose that host in the first place (all good reviews)… But if Airbnb removes the bad reviews, you have no way to know. I stopped using Airbnb because Airbnb is nothing without the honest reviews.",1,"Michael of Lebanon, Other"
93,I needed to travel to Mayo Clinic in Phoenix AZ. My nurse suggested Airbnb. When our Uber driver pulled up he begged us to go to a hotel in safe neighborhood but I had to pay full amount 2 weeks beforehand. The house was cute and clean and had security but every night we heard gunshots and had police helicopters with spotlights overhead. My brother tried to take a stroll during daylight in opposite directions over 2 days. Both days he was confronted by cops arresting people. 2 more Uber drivers warned about where we were staying. 1 had grown up in Chicago.

Electrical outlets broken, dirty old stained furniture, the window air conditioner was stuff with hand towels, there was a bedroom with a mattress on the floor. When you call to make a complaint you get their customer service that is overseas and they speak very little English. They did not want to reimburse us and they will not that the listing off, so beware when you plan your next vacation. They also edited your review and only post positive reviews.

95,Be sure to know their cancellation policy before booking with AIRBNB. There are hidden terms Which you will not come across until you book and cancel. I was charged $108 service fee for cancelling even though I cancelled within 48 hours.,1,"Ashwini of Pewaukee, WI"
96,"The place I rented did not have the amenities it promised (heated pool) and was dirty. Also the host showed up in our backyard in the dark with a flashlight unannounced during our stay and it made us feel extremely unsafe. So, there is the component of having a host that is dodgy. But the component that compelled me to write this review is the way Airbnb handled my concern. They sided with the host based on his rating overall rather than my individual experience. My experience was uniquely bad but because his reviews were ok from other guests my concern were not addressed and was minimized. There is no direct number to contact Airbnb and so all complaints are logged in an e-mail process. They called me back and that's when I got their number. By the way, it's 855-424-7262 if anyone is looking to call them directly.",1,"Brooke of Salt Lake City, UT"
97,"The owner agrees to cancellation in writing then afterwards refuses refund. Airbnb support him 100% ignoring evidence.

98,"I had the unfortunate experience of having to cancel my Airbnb reservation outside of the '48 hr' window. The owner Jan from British Columbia refused to give us back our $478 deposit hiding behind her cancellation policy. Airbnb sided with her and refused to help at all.

I swiftly closed my Airbnb account and will tell everyone I know about my bad experience. Stay away.",1,"James of Escondido, CA"
99,"Airbnb promising me to take care of it but they just toss it from one to another and eventually told me it's not part of their focus. The real problem is that the so called ""case managers"" don't follow up on cases, they just wait till their shift ends and when you call back to check up on it they say to you it's a different department and the maximum they can do is to assign it to new case manager and start it over again.",1,"Guy of Other, Other"

I booked a week through these idiots and paid the required 60%. I decided to book an additional 5 nights but canceled due to the homeowner being a lying moron.

Most of the time the electricity in the common areas is blacked out making it impossible to see where you're going and also impossible to know if you are being followed.

While I understand I have a record from when I was young and dumb but if this keeps me from getting a place shouldn't it be looked into before you take my money and give me codes for the house? Now I'm screwed out of $800 for the next 15 business days while it goes back to my account, which was my money for a place for the next month.

We were smoked out but the host claimed the wood was wet...which wasn't true. We traveled to Walmart 30 miles away because they left us two huge pieces of wood and nothing to start it with.

So much for trying to save some money on places to stay when I travel now! >:-(",1,"Judy of Parkersburg, WV"

114,"I was looking to book a condo using Airbnb. This was my first time using their service. I wanted to make sure there were no other fees aside from the total shown during booking so I called the customer service number. I was reassured that there were no other fees to be collected as this was against Airbnb policy. I asked because I saw a mention of taxes were to be collected. I asked the same question and was given the same answer. This was around 11pm at night. The following day, the property manager called me about the taxes due. I called customer service and I was told I was to pay the taxes since it's listed on the website. Well, that's why I called prior to booking. ",1,"C of Houston, TX"

116,"Renters beware. Booking an Airbnb with Nina, Marais district, Paris France, was my first experience at booking an Airbnb, and consequently will be my only experience, booking anything through Airbnb. My trip was schedule and then Hurricane Irma hit (the largest hurricane to hit the state of Florida in history). Nina told me to reschedule but I had to contact her off Airbnb. (I later learned this was so she could still collect my payment and Airbnb would still get their kickback). She let me reschedule and then on the day I was supposed to fly out, she told me she double booked and that I would have to stay at a different location, for which she refused to disclose details.",1,"Sarah of Vero Beach, FL"
117,Beware booking with Airbnb far in advance of your trip. I just booked an apartment in Malta for a month in March and they charged me the full amount on Nov 7th rather than a deposit and the balance in February. When I phoned Customer Service there is of course nothing they can do. Just be careful when booking - make sure you are pre-approved for the rental then you will have the option of 2 payments.,1,Fred of Canada
118,"We booked a condo in Angel Fire, NM for 7 days over Christmas at a listed price of $168 per night. After our 50% deposit was accepted and our reservation confirmed the “Hosts” called me separately, emailed me and sent me a private message over Airbnb that they had accidentally posted the incorrect price and if we did not accept their “altered” price of $535 a night then they would cancel our reservation. Knowing they legally can’t make us pay for their mistake, the wife called me begging that we please cancel or they would not be able to make their mortgage. ",1,"Jennifer of Grand Prairie, TX"
119,"I and my wife rented a house in Lake Havasu for two weeks at a price of about $4,000.00. We were so eaten by bed bugs. We reported this to the owner and to Airbnb. We were told to take pictures to prove the bedbug. We took several pictures and sent them to the owner and Airbnb. We were told that the owner had supposedly taken care of the problem but my wife and my grandkids were bitten all over by the bed bugs. We were told that we should have reported it as soon as we got bit. We waited a couple of days to make sure what they were. We were offered a whole 10% off the rental rate. We will have bills for fixing our house and the houses of our children and their kids. I will never use this service again due to way we were treated. I highly encourage everyone not to use this service-ever!",1,"Dennis of Wilsonville, OR"

When I came home later that day it was raining in my garage, the bathroom is right above the garage. He caused a lot of damage to my home and had the nerve to leave me a bad review. I contacted Airbnb support about the damage and the review, they put a case manager on my claim and his dishonest review, they will not support me as a host or remove the review.

121,"Not worth the bother or the money. I stayed in Copenhagen and was not at all satisfied with my room. I stayed in a basement where I couldn't lock the front door. The owner was not helpful at all, actually he was slightly hostile. And of course I didn't get some of the money back that I have paid. When I came home I was going to write a scathing review of this place but oh no. I had two weeks to do it they said, but after a few days it was too late. I contacted Airbnb about the review/deadline but that was like talking to a wall. It's extremely hard to get any response and when they finally answer they are of no help at all. Stay at a decent hotel or don't go at all is my suggestion.",1,Fred of Sweden

I will get a notification from Host two days after that he wants to increase the price for 80% and I complain to Airbnb customer support about it (how would you let the host do this much increase after confirming my reservation). After a week, Airbnb did no do ANYTHING for me regarding this issue and they just cancel my reservation without any support. They let the host do whatever they want to the customers and they do not give any support to their customers. They even do not have any review system in their website after they cancel your reservation. Please share this with others so they know how Airbnb is acting in regard of customer service.",1,"Hesam of San Mateo, CA"
123,"I complained to Airbnb about cockroaches in my Toquerville, Utah, rental. The owner didn’t take accountability and Airbnb sides with her. They said they would only give me 1/2 of my money back, which I still have yet to see, because the roach photos I sent “didn’t prove an infestation."" What??? I didn’t realize a few cockroaches are a-ok when hosting tenants! (There were more than a few, but my pictures showed only several at once.)  Airbnb should be consumer-based, rather than siding with their hosts so much, judging by the other reviews. I’ll happily stay in hotels henceforth, as I KNOW a hotel would go above and beyond to make reparations for something as disgusting as this.",1,"Jessica of Clifton Park, NY"
124,"My friends booked an overnight stay in Brooklyn. I’ve never used Airbnb before. My friends, who are **, found this place in Brooklyn that was convenient and priced right. The owner was well rated, so there were no issues. I called him a week before the booking, to check on parking. We had two cars. I was concerned about on street parking. I asked if there was a lot nearby. He assured me that the neighborhood was safe and that we could get both our cars in his driveway. Ok, cool.",1,"Kim of Youngstown, OH"
125,So I moved provinces in Canada and before my son and I could settle down we booked into a *5 Star superhost* apartment in Toronto for 31 days. The pics were of a different apartment. The place was filthy dirty. The stove almost burnt us and the microwave was broken. The owner was out of the country and realized that he was renting the place and then *renting as an Airbnb* when he was away or staying at his girlfriend's. The owner of the place I mean my host's landlord one time stopped me and asked me what I was doing in his building. I explained to him and he almost kicked me out and I had already paid 1600$.,1,Jeri of Canada

We contacted the host and waited 24+ hours for an answer. We also contacted Airbnb, they were useless. The case manager was rude and did not offer any help other than to file a complain and to email pictures. We requested a refund and she denied our request. They took the word of the host over ours. Never again. STAY AWAY.",1,"Belinda of Oviedo, FL"

Owner had us go through 3 security locks to get INTO the house only to find the back door wide open. Owners also did an oops and left the door to their hoarder room open, and then didn’t even have our room ready. I couldn’t get out quick enough and went to battle with Airbnb. They were difficult and wanted to charge 1/2 due to us “cancelling”. I insisted on sending pics to justify why we should get full refund. If I hadn’t taken pics, I’m sure I would have had to pay. After jumping through hoops, we got full refund.",1,"Lisa of Gilbert, AZ"

131,"The additional fees are a rip-off. In the end the total costs work out more expensive than staying at a good reliable hotel in more central location. Got charged $99 service fees and $60 cleaning fees on top of $600 accommodation fee for 4 nights stay in a small apartment in Shinjuku. When I found a good 3 star hotel with breakfast included at a more Tokyo central location, which is also part of Qantas travel program, I attempted cancelling the Airbnb reservation, only to find out that you could only do this on a computer not on your phone or iPad, and that the service fee is not refundable because it was already more than 48 hours when I made the booking. I felt extremely frustrated because it said nowhere when I made the booking that the service fee is non-refundable after 48 hours. Literally a ripoff and a scam. On a note bookings through Agoda or Booking.com are free, if hotels have free cancellation policies you get all your money back.",1,"Hannah of Cranbourne North, Other"

We checked in at 3 pm, and first thing we noticed was that the rug in the living room was seriously disgusting, red wine was spilled all over it, and it had cigarette burns. But really the worst was when we went to bed. After some minutes we realized the smell, and then it dawned on us that we were sleeping in very used sheets/bed covers/pillow cases. The next day we reported it to the owner, by Whatsapp, and he came and removed the rug, and attempted to change the linen, but he is a young lawyer, and had never changed a bed in his lifetime, so my wife ended up doing it.",1,christian of Argentina

No bowls in the cabinets, microwave filthy, etc. When I confronted the host I was told he had fired the maid and would be cleaning himself. No cleaning occurred despite the fact this was a shared bathroom and guests came and went. On a Sunday night, host had a party until 4 a.m. in which all the Airbnb guests stood in the hallway asking him to turn the music down. I moved out 1 week early and requested a full refund of unused days and supplied pictures of my issues.

We told the host we would not be arriving until around midnight. He said no problem, just call when we got there and he would provide us a code to get in the door. When we arrived in Jersey City at midnight, I called Jason (the host) and got no answer. The neighborhood seems very sketchy. I had to call 5 or 6 times before he answered and gave us a code. We got into the place and it was about 95 degrees maybe more. There was no A/c in the apartment as described in the ad. There was 2 towels for 2 guys who were staying for 4 nights.

141,"We reserved an Airbnb in Washington DC about 10 months before trip. While travelling, Airbnb cancelled our booking about 1 week prior to that visit... Reason? Because the house owner was not complying, with their rules... They were warned 3 times... Did not comply so were taken off the site. Instead of penalizing the apartment themselves they actually penalised us more as we are stuck with nowhere to stay. The American office then emailed us to give us other choices of accommodation then booked it for us. We are Canadian so unknowingly they booked it in US dollars without telling us. That was a natural mistake as the agent didn't even think of that. But for us it meant another 30% increase. Their office would not do anything, even was going to penalise us for cancelling. We will never use their service again.",1,"Stan of Kelowna, Canada"

They have a very poor interface with your local government, and when something goes wrong will not warn you in advance. Instead, they'll just cancel all your upcoming visitors. That'll BE your notice that something has gone wrong. You'll have to email your local government to find out what the actual problem is, because Airbnb's tech isn't good enough to determine the problem and convey it to you.

After that, the following fee will be deducted from your first payout after a cancellation. The amount deducted will depend on when you accepted the reservation and how soon before check-in you canceled"". ",1,"Lisa of Greenwich, CT"

We got kicked out of our room on Sunday to accommodate the incoming guests.

They are a website and nothing else. Many other Real Estate sites to choose from with the same properties that don't rob customers and then hide from their Customer Service responsibility. Absolute tragedy paying as much money as I did for literally nothing. Be careful with expensive booking...

147,"As an Airbnb host, Airbnb completely let me down!!! When I rented my home to a customer, I never expected to come back home to a deserted party house. It was very obvious that the woman who stayed there over the weekend threw a party that got out of hand. We submitted pictures and invoices to Airbnb letting them know the damages and proof of what we paid in repairs. Airbnb declined to hold the woman accountable and/or help us to cover any of the costs themselves, with no explanation why. Since then, I’ve decided that the risk of allowing strangers to stay in my home is too risky when the company who is supposed to protect your home doesn't do the right thing.

I was fully made aware that your policy is to not help find listings for 3rd party bookings and was told several times that this was breaking protocol, but I did at this point let the staff know that I’d stay with my mom as well in order to void the seemingly insurmountable problem. Once we crossed this hurdle, I won't deny that your teams did try to assist us in finding listings we had already found on our own many times over (you have a very big staff, I may have spoken to more than half of them).

I again reiterated that these were 1-2 night stays. AirBnB responded that I had agreed to 10% discount for customers"".

Bank of America says Airbnb has to do a chargeback to retrieve the money and then refund to the correct card. Airbnb wrote that they DO NOT DO CHARGEBACKS. It is how their system is set up.

153,"I am both a guest and host. For the most part Airbnb has been a good experience. However I have found they did not protect their hosts. I'm guessing maybe due to who pays them. I clearly offered a strict nonsmoking condo. My guest stayed 2-3 weeks and smoked inside the condo the entire time, to the point the cleaning crew went twice after their stay to try and remove the strong odor of cigarette smoke. In addition I had to change all filters, and clean any fabric, curtains, sofa, chairs, rugs, etc. that absorbed smoke.

I told them the changes had been made before I was locked out and the account is now set up and working. I have had no reply from them. The help person was no help at all and was saying sales speak with no meaning or relevance. I have found if you speak out they hold you to ransom. Poor service and a pack of thieves.

The property did not have a driveway and you were forced to park on the side of a mountain, also the road that lead to the property was a freshly grated dirt road on a steep incline. When we contacted the site about this issue and how unsafe it was they did nothing about it. The host refused to refund any of the money even though we did not stay at cabin. I asked the site to look into this and they choose not to listen to me. The host called me a liar and said that any vehicle could make it to the location. I am out over $700 with no help from the site. It took them over 2 weeks to respond to my claim. The initial email that they sent me said that they would have it resolved in 72 hours.

I worked with a case manager at Airbnb who promised me a refund on the phone after the stay was over. After the stay ended, I contacted Airbnb and they basically said that they never agreed to anything at all despite the apartment was in violation of safety and cleanliness Airbnb policies.",1,"Jason of Chestnut Hill, MA"
162,"Airbnb is a terrible customer service experience. They told my guest they will refund them without my permission. They had the guest occupy the space, agreed to the guest’s unreasonable request to get refunded and forcibly took money from my account. What did guest bring as an excuse? That the place wasn’t empty of my personal belongings. Like ** grow up and know this is a house not a hotel. Take your cheap ** to the hotel. Airbnb customer care is pure ** people with no appreciation that they are making money out of other people property. They believe they are obligated to issue refund and it is all at the cost of the host. I certainly like to sue them for this and love to get advice on how to do so. Customer care never responds and always promises to call you back but never does.",1,"Hami of Chicago, IL"
163,Refused to re-issue a refund to updated payment method. Refund is in limbo from the merchant to the bank ping-ponging back-and-forth and Airbnb refused to put the refund on the new payment method or mail us a check. They left in my face and refused to let me speak to a supervisor.,1,"Andrea of Palm Bay, FL"
164,"Posted your letter along with my response to our Facebook account and to our FOX NEWS affiliates in D.C. Our hope is that tens of thousands of Airbnb users will be as enraged by your flagrant violation and use of personal information as we are. Needless to say, it is doubtful we'll never hear from you. After all, we are the Deplorables and you are the all knowing, the elitists... called to correct our ignorant ways.",1,"Rob of Tampa, FL"
165,Just saw a story on the local news where Airbnb double booked another family. Thought I would share my story. They did the same thing to me back in Colorado this past June 2018. Never bothered to tell me the house had been double booked. Only way I found out was I saw credit on my credit card statement and I called. Neither Airbnb or host bothered to call and tell me. I had one month to scramble to try to find another house that accepted 2 dogs and everything was booked. I finally found one. No thanks to Airbnb and all they offered was $25 off. This company sucks and I will never do business with them again.,1,"Tanya of Bay City, TX"
166,"I signed up to be a host -- had to cancel (in plenty of time) due to extenuating circumstances. The guest was fine with it. Airbnb charged me $100, and it was totally unclear when I canceled that this charge would later be levied. This is a very shady company and I would recommend not doing business with them.",1,"Cal of Syracuse, NY"
167,"Absolutely the WORST company I've ever dealt with. When our host kicked us out for even daring to call Airbnb due to discrepancies in his listing, as well as having his wife verbally harass and threaten us, Airbnb did absolutely nothing. Completely unhelpful. They did give us a refund and an extra $40 but, at that point, everything in the area was booked or was 300+ a night. They didn't help us find another place to stay, leaving us without a home in Vancouver (we had to sit at the airport for 5 hours, refreshing the page to find another host), and only made matters worse by deciding to contact the wife AFTER we had expressed our concern for our safety. ",1,"Rebekah of Boise, ID"
168,"After staying at the Airbnb quite frequently while I was still looking for a permanent place in the new place I have moved to I started noticing that they will do ""anything"" to keep their business going. 1. They are not allowing any guest to stay continuously in a best ranked homes so that their service fee will add up. 2. They are not checking or validating the safety of the homes and they claim that they are not responsible for any unsafe condition of the homes in the listing. ",1,"Anitha of Charlotte, NC"
169,"My family and I with three kids aged between 1 and 8 years arrived to this ""resort"" yesterday. Immediately we noticed how ruined down the place was. Nothing like the pictures. We decided to walk around and see the rest of the facilities, the family pool in particular breaks any health and safety regulation, I have never seen anything like this before. So, the pool is located next to a drop of at least 50 meters, the edge of the pool (where your kids are meant to walk while playing) has nothing dividing the edge and the pool. If anyone falls into that drop someone will get seriously hurt. Having seen this we decided not to stay.",1,"Jorge of Great Britain, Other"
170,"When arriving at the Airbnb in London, the room was still not cleaned at the check in time. I let the owner know and he said the maid said it was cleaned but I was there and it was not; towels on the floor, bed with dirty linens, completely not cleaned. 30 min. Later still no maid and no clean room, so I left letting the owner know I was leaving not to return. I did not receive a complete refund because they say I didn't cancel and I didn't have proof of the dirty room. This was my first attempt with Airbnb and my last.",1,"Laura of Charlottesville, VA"
171,"We had booked a place to stay but had to cancel within 24 hours of making the booking because a few guests that were coming with us had to pull out. The terms and conditions stated we would be given a full refund in circumstances where bookings were cancelled within 48 hours. It has been four weeks later, four phone calls to Airbnb's customer service and several attempts to contact them on their feedback page but without luck. We are getting increasingly frustrated that the deposit has not been refunded, but what is worse is that the staff at Airbnb don't care. Terrible terrible terrible! Will never use again and advise you to do the same.",1,Steven of Australia
172,I spent a lot of time finding and booking a condo. The host asked a silly question that I did not immediately respond to because I was busy. The host canceled my reservation because I did not immediately respond to his stupid question.,1,"Nancy of Golden, CO"
173,"We have used Airbnb a lot in the past, but this time it was disgusting. Often, Airbnb rentals can be good - but more frequently than it should be, the rentals are not clean. In this case the sheets smelled, and there was visible hair - from the previous renter. We came in late, and Italy was having a heat wave; previously, my wife had gotten heat stroke, so we were just exhausted. So we did not report it to Airbnb right away. Since we waited, Airbnb refuses to help us. Kim, in their customer support department, is not sympathetic at all.",1,"Kevin of Campbell, CA"
174,"I referred another host to Airbnb before I had sufficient experience with their customer disservice department. I was promised in writing a $300 referral fee. This promise appeared on my referral page. All of the customer service people have stated that I am either an idiot or a liar and that this was only a progress bar. The notification on my page said you will receive your money in 15 business days not that my money was pending. Then after complaining to a customer service rep who denied I was entitled to the money I received an email saying, ""Don't lose hope refer another host to get a referral fee."" Having been defrauded one time why would I try it again? There is no way to directly contact the actual department that handles problems.",1,"Erica of Brooklyn, NY"
175,"I booked a room on Airbnb in Brooks, Maine. It said a ""loft"" on a farm. What I found was a dilapidated run down farmhouse with an attic space. A broken down fridge on the back porch, a door with a missing window pane and a filthy kitchen with piles of clothes. The room was almost 90 degrees so I turned on the a/c that was in the room. It blew out cold in front and hot in the back. It was a sauna. So I call Airbnb after speaking to our nonexistent hosts. What did I get - ""Well you should have taken pics."" I said it was 9 pm and I took pics of the room temperature and how the ""loft"" had no privacy door - forget a lock. ",1,"Graciela of Jackson, WY"
176,I had to cancel my vacation and no longer will need Airbnb accommodations. I canceled within the 48 hrs of cancellation policy and the host is refusing to give me a full refund. The host is not honoring the 48 hrs cancellation and full refund policy.,1,"Maris of Boca Raton, FL"
177,"We rented a home in an area near Omaha Nebraska. It looked very nice. The basement was storage and off limits. No problem, we paid hundreds of dollars for four nights and yay! In the first ten minutes we figure out the basement is inhabited by a drunk guy who does maintenance. He left the basement door ajar weaving his truck past our car in the driveway to get away then drove up and down the street. Really scary when he parked pointed into the backyard. Got pictures of piles of booze bottles etc. ",1,"walter of Mesa, AZ"
178,"As of this writing Airbnb and one of their partner hosts, Jacks Realty in West Palm Beach, Fl. have not refunded my money amounting to near $1,600. I booked a rental which turned out to be a health hazard and death trap which is typical of a slumlord type property. We could not stay in the place as it was so unfit and had to find a hotel in the area. I sent many photos as proof of my claim and Airbnb ignored them. The unit was not fit for human habitation and to say the least not as advertised. The property had just been fumigated with signs posted as warnings to occupants.",1,"Ronald of Palm Beach Gardens, FL"
179,Airbnb gave one of my guests a 50% refund - without my permission - because two hornets came into the property. The reason given was that I had not disclosed in advance that an animal was present. Hosts should be aware that Airbnb can refund with no good reason. I will be taking legal advice.,1,Caroline of US
180,Nothing but terrible experiences with Airbnb and their “services.” To say the least this company has poor customer service and does not take any responsibility for any mishaps that occur at their venues. They don’t care about their customers whatsoever or the fact that the places they post on their site could be a scam. They don’t check out any of the venues they post on their site to see if they are legit and meet their standards. ,1,Erin of USA
181,"I had made a reservation at an Airbnb in Quincy, IL. When I got to the place it was filthy dirty. I took about 50 pictures of the place, then sent a note to the host that I would not be staying and also contacted Airbnb with the situation and sent them pictures. After 6 weeks of trying to get my money back nothing has happened except for me getting the run around from Airbnb. The bedroom garbage can was full, bed looked like it was slept in. The towel and wash rags they left in my room for use we’re all stained green and yellow. ",1,"Vicki of Usa, USA"
182,"I have book a home to stay with my family of 5 in Canada but after 2 weeks we have found mice in home and inform Airbnb about it. They cancelled our staying home agreement without relocating us somewhere else. Actually recommended us a place 2000 mm always where we stayed. (Recommended from Ontario to Nova Scotia by a case manager, which I have proof in my email).",1,"Veysel of Usa, USA"
183,"We booked a home through Airbnb and paid the required amount. The next day payment was canceled by Airbnb and we were asked to contact customer service. We did so and the customer service staff we talked to was unfriendly and unprofessional. He did not give us enough details as to why the payment was canceled, especially after it had gone through flawlessly 24 house earlier with the same house. Clearly there was a glitch at their end, but once confronted, they did not give any satisfactory answer and instead canceled the account. As far as we are concerned, they don't have decent customer service skills. They need a lot of improvement and training on basic human service.",1,"E. of Nairobi, Other"
184,"I rented a boat (a 1980 Chris Craft) at the Jersey Shore (Wildwood, NJ). When we first arrived the boat was not was we expected it to be. However, I was ready for the adventure and was willing to overlook the lack of basic necessities as a result. But as time when on, we discovered there were many problems with the boat, for example we had no running water for the first week we were there, the host did not empty the commode from the previous guest prior to our arrival as he told me he still needed to do that (we arrived a day late so he had plenty of time to do this). It was more than a week after we arrived that he finally tended to the toilet and only after we complained of the stench on the boat as a result. ",1,"Cindy of Philadelphia, PA"
185,"Customer Service is unhelpful and degrading. Had an issue with a service they provided, which was a clear violation of their terms and policies, but the customer service agents failed to recognize it. And after several messages, just stopped responding. Seems like they will say anything to get out of actually providing real help.",1,"Benjamin of Los Angeles, CA"
186,"We have used Airbnb for the first time. We booked an apartment in Prague in August 2018. We were happy with the apartment... nice and clean, well equipped and quite central. Metro station, supermarkets and various restaurants at walking distance. The hosts were very helpful before we arrived at the apartment. However, things changed drastically once we arrived there. The apartment was so hot! We were fully aware that there was no air conditioning in the apartment and it happened to be a heatwave. So, we asked for two extra big fans (or at least one more) as there was only one small fan since the apartment was simply unbearable to stay in. ",1,"Kenneth of L-Imtarfa, Other"
187,On 24 July I requested a booking for 7 days with Airbnb. It was refused by the owner but AU $400 was still deducted from my PayPal account. Airbnb promised (by email) a refund within 7 days. Today is August 14 and still no refund. Any suggestions as to a course of action?,1,"Dianne of Paradise Waters, Other"
188,"First of all I’m sure there are amazing things about Airbnb, I was just unfortunate and didn’t have a great experience! We booked a stay through Airbnb for my dad's 50th birthday... the information included “sleeps 8 and has 3 bedrooms”. You could clearly see two rooms had queen beds, but then the 3rd looked like two twins beds. The host confirmed that it was twin beds, so I assumed (it sleeps 8) there must be a pull out couch. Thinking two couples could stay in the queen rooms, we could sleep on the pull out couch and my toddler (age 2) could sleep in the room with two twin beds.",1,"Caitlin of Gander, NL"
189,"Rude and unreliable. You might get lucky and have a good experience but you lose your hard earned money if you are not. Airbnb doesn’t take responsibility of an ill maintained home. Don’t go for it. I ended up in a listing where my father and I got sick within an hour of getting in because it smelled so bad, old and dusty. There was evidence of rodent infestation and the host sounded pretty unapologetic about it! I had to leave and go to a hotel. Upon contacting Airbnb they said since I didn’t give the host “a chance to fix the issues” I won’t be given any refund. Like, how can you fix the first impression of a guest who sees a book eaten at the corner by a rodent in a home you paid for?! Doesn’t it imply that you don’t maintain the house like you should have and now that you are caught, you want to try covering up? I didn’t get my money back - my hard earned money, but I am writing the review so that it can help at least one person!",1,"Piya of Column, OH"
190,"When I was looking to book a stay, Airbnb's website said I would not be charged at booking, which I wanted because I wanted to pay in cash. Well, I was charged. I canceled right away thinking I did something wrong, re-booked, and was charged a second time. I kept the second reservation. I also noticed I did not receive my $40 credit for being referred. My referring friend did not receive her $20 credit either. I tried contacting Airbnb which is a complete JOKE!!! If you're fluent in English, expect to not receive a fluent speaking associate if they even feel like returning your call at all. I was told my account has been activated for 2 years therefore, I was not eligible for a credit. ",1,"Sarah of Sheffield Lake, OH"
191,"When booking rentals through Airbnb. There isn't any explanations about the ""type"" cancellation your HOST has on their property, until you cancel, then that is when you find out WHAT TYPE you have on your stay. The site doesn't say 50% of the TOTAL RENTAL FEE DUE (even though you may have only paid the 1/2 that is required to hold your reservation), it just says 50% refund. Airbnb site also says cleaning fees are ALWAYS refunded, but that hasn't been the case either. VERY DISAPPOINTED in this as to I had 2 separate reservations I just cancelled (1 was not my choice but the other was because of this situation), lost $981.70 (only refunded $12.77 of $875.40 reservation and $31.68 of $1088 reservation))!!! GUYS, this is so unfair!!! RIDICULOUS!!",1,"Wendy of Alexandria, AL"
192,"I booked an apartment in Toronto on July 6, for six days in August. My account was charged for half the amount of the rental. Without notification, my reservation was cancelled. I only learned of this when I checked the Airbnb website yesterday, a few days before check in. I contacted Airbnb Customer Service, and after several attempts, I spoke to a representative. The representative said the host had cancelled (the host said Airbnb had cancelled). There was no explanation as to why, or why I hadn't been contacted. The representative said she was sending the file to a case manager in her group and I would hear from them. I haven't heard anything, even though I have followed up with the representative twice. Because it is so close to check in, it cost me 40% more to book a comparable apartment. Airbnb doesn't take responsibility for anything---it should be regulated the way hotels are. They should be accountable.",1,"Robert of Seattle, WA"
193,"I am currently visiting England from the US. Today, I found out that due to a “glitch” in their system Airbnb has cancelled my accommodations for tomorrow. I am now in a foreign country with no place to stay. I spent ALL day on the phone with them and they do completely admit it’s their fault. The case managers and supervisor said they were going to call me back and then they never did. They insisted on corresponding only through messaging on their app and would just stop responding. This has been an awful experience and after 6 hours they just texted me a $100 coupon. As if that could possibly make up for what they’ve done. I will NEVER use Airbnb again.",1,"Erin of Philadelphia, PA"
194,"Wow! After $877.00 later, hours on the phone, lots of correspondence with the Airbnb Caseworker, who can’t even seem to figure out how many days we actually booked or what actually happened, I’m amazed at the incompetence. I took photos of everything to prove our case. The place looked nothing like the photos and had not been kept up or maintained at all. Airbnb is not even able to negotiate with the host on behalf of a 5 star rated guest with Vacasa, a real estate company who is listing on Airbnb as a “host” who is mismanaging 91 thousand properties as stated by the host when we contacted them immediately upon arrival to the nightmare location. In all our years of traveling the world, we’ve never experienced anything like it. ",1,"Lydia of Flowery Branch, GA"
195,"I have usually been satisfied by the accommodations from Airbnb. Not this time. We were located close to the California town of Visalia. After a long drive, we checked in (Airbnb near Sequoia National Park). To our horror, the air conditioning was not working, and it was 100 degrees outside. Fortunately, they fixed it partially the next day. But then a swarm of ants and many mice greeted us. We left the place early. Clearly the home was not maintained at all. If you can't find a park lodge to live in, don't go at all. The distances are long and the Airbnb homes are not habitable.",1,"Godfrey of Long Beach, CA"
196,"I tried to cancel a reservation I made for Sept 28-30 in Worcester, Ma. I could not find the reservation or easily find a phone number for Airbnb. After three phone call and half an hour I finally found a person who would send me an email confirming that there was no reservation.",1,"John of Wilton, CT"
197,"As their new update policy, they force us to accept it and upload our government issued ID for identity verification. But they do not mention how they can protect our ID from being stolen. I don't believe they have this ability. Besides, including Amazon and any other website, no one ever requires government ID, they should not have the right to do so. It's unfair policy for customers. Thus, I canceled my account, and I will tell all my family and friends to cancel theirs as well.",1,"YANG of Fleming Island, FL"
198,"July 2018, a group of ladies booked an Airbnb in Atlanta. The place was unclean and in a less than desirable location. Upon calling the host and getting nowhere we contacted airbnb and reported the condition of the unit and expressed our concerns. After many phone calls back and forth we ended up at the Marriott and Airbnb did absolutely nothing for us. I would NOT recommend this business to anyone as it seems they back the hosts but do nothing for the patrons.",1,"Paula of Clarksville, TN"
199,"Guest showed up late, locked herself out and refused to take a full refund and go someplace else. Guest trashed me and the place and claimed things completely false or lies with the exception except perhaps in brain, obviously with issues! Airbnb had photos and confirmation of issues and FAILED any conflict resolution! Airbnb allowed a FALSE review to stand and then decided to ban me from their program when ""Safety and Security"" decided they did not want to deal with my persistence and disappointment in delayed payments!",1,"Sue of Kalamazoo, MI"
200,"I recently booked a reservation for a September trip to my hometown in Michigan, a trip I take yearly with my mother and my sister, all of us flying in from different locations. I used the 48-hour-cancel-for-free filter, and upon receiving the street address to the reserved listing, my 83-year-old mother determined the location was unfortunately too far from downtown for her to be able to walk to & from. So I cancelled this reservation within the 48 hours of having booked it and booked a different (and much more expensive) listing closer to downtown. To my surprise, my 48-hour-cancel-for-free refund did not include the $160.95 service fee, which I took to be a clear error on Airbnb’s part, as nowhere on their 48-hour-cancel-for-free filter is it specified that the service fee is non-refundable.

201,"First time user of Airbnb. HORRIBLE experience. Cannot recommend and will never reuse. Completed online registration. Booked room. Owner writes back that, ""I am not comfortable with you."" Taken aback as I was listed as ""verified"" by Airbnb, and he didn't KNOW me so how could he be uncomfortable with me? Then, searched the city to which we were traveling again. Booked. Only AFTER booking do I see that it isn't in the city I was searching but about 30 miles outside the city. Troubled by the fact that the company allows listing outside the listed destination to come up, but learned my lesson. Canceled the reservation without incident.",1,"Devon of Tampa, FL"
202,"We booked a condo through Airbnb for Sept 2018. From Ryan ** Of Indiana. We have a medical situation where our toddler granddaughter needs surgery, it is a have to for her health, we have to travel to Columbus Ohio in September, so we asked to cancel, Mr ** said it was not a reason to qualify for a refund. We canceled 2 months early, he can easily rerent the condo in Gulf Shores, Al. We were told there won't be a refund. That's not right, we were told to expect a refund the 26th of July, now today they said no refund. Airbnb refund policy is very unfair, be careful using this company, if something comes up, you will lose your money. I will never use this company again, nor will I recommend them to anyone, I hope Karma comes around.",1,"Dennis of Decherd, TN"
203,"I have to say, I am very disappointed with AIRBNB service as on 3 occasions, host has canceled my bookings which were made several weeks ago.

204,"As a new Airbnb user, I had some difficulty with two bookings. I had to cancel and rebook. I did rebook and followed thru with the booking. They counted those cancellations against me. My family had me book a family get together and when one of the grandsons was unable to come, they asked me to cancel the reservation. It was expensive. I talked to the homeowner, when I did the booking, explaining that I would cancel, if necessary, within a week, so that he would not lose the opening. When I cancelled, Airbnb charged me a significant amount of money.",1,"Susan of Truth Or Consequences, NM"
205,"Tried to book a property in Halifax with Monica. Never received booking confirmation so I moved on and booked a hotel. Four days later I see an Airbnb charge on my account for $1476. Note: cancellation policy is 48 hours and 50% refund. However, it is impossible to cancel a booking in 48 hours if you don't have it. Airbnb tells me I have 2 accounts and verified confirmation email was sent. Email they sent had invalid address ending in .ccom. They probably received unable to deliver notice.",1,"Jerry of New Braunfels, TX"
206,"We had a problem with our vacation rental in Carolina Beach... The ad for the beach house did not say anything about how noisy the location would be...

207,"Airbnb has no idea what a homeowner has to do in order to keep the home in perfect condition for the next client. And they do not care. As long as they advertise your property and take the money. My personal contract for our beach house clearly states that trashing the house or backyard is unacceptable and carries extra fees for cleaning. However, if you ever got your house or backyard dirty and trashed, to a point that it needs double time for the cleaning service to make it ready for the next client, you cannot get any extra payment - Airbnb claims that since there is no physical damage, they do not charge extra. On top of that, the communications from their agent are sharp, negative and totally inappropriate. My tenants had the backyard full of beer cans for 2 full days, and we had to clean it on Sunday. On my expense. I HAVE TAKEN MY PROPERTY OFF THEIR LIST. We have other agencies we work with who appreciate our business.",1,"Lia of Bethesda, MD"
208,"I had an account years ago that I used with no problem. I tried to log in today to find accommodations in Charleston, SC. The AirBNB site insisted I verify my account and suggested I do so through my cell phone. When I downloaded the phone app, the site wanted permission to access my contacts. REALLY!!?? For what possible legitimate purpose? No other booking site has ever asked me for that kind of access. The next step in the process would have been to send a copy of the front & back of my driver's license, passport or visa. I DON'T THINK SO!!! Can you spell: ""Identification theft""??? Message to President, Chairman of the Board, and CFO of AirBNB: ""I'll send you that information on myself right after you send me the same information on yourselves!"" Sorry AirBNB hosts. No business from my household!",1,"Suzanne of Huntersville, NC"
209,"I hosted for Airbnb and had some great experiences until this happened. One guest booked 7 nights. Then she contacted and asked to extend to 9 nights and would pay cash.

Point - Airbnb does not guarantee you will get paid.",1,"Charles of Point Roberts, WA"
210,"We showed up at this Airbnb house at 805 Red Oak Lane, Arlington, TX, 76012. When we arrived, the AC is totally non functional. It was 85 degrees downstairs and approximately 95 degrees upstairs. A sweatbox. The outside AC unit/compressor hadn't been serviced or cleaned in years as was evidenced by the build up of dirt around the vented metal panel that allows access to the capacitors. The maintenance people who showed up to fix the problem had to dig 3-5 inches down in the dirt just to get the door off because of years of erosion. ",1,"Jeff of Fortson, GA"
211,"The reason for the review is because we have been given vague and elusive behind account block. On 7/24/2018 we reverified our identities and we were reassured that once the transmittal from SSA was received funds would be available immediately. We received no notification or account alert of any ""unusual activity"" unless they count the numerous logins the past 72 hours. Who does not check their account constantly when bills are due. We received creditor extensions due to a security breach at our previous bank. This account ending card ending in ** had always been a mere back up account.",1,"ROBERT of Keller, TX"
212,Unpractical refund/cancellation policy. If canceled within 14 business days and owner is able to rent the unit refunds should be given. How is it that you have strict cancellation policy that only allows a consumer to cancel within 48 hours for a full refund when booked 3 months in advance. It’s best to use Airbnb for short notice hotel reservations. Otherwise you are screwed if owner decide to implement “strict refund policy” and will not accommodate unforeseen circumstances! I’ll stick with hotels going forward! Airbnb app DELETED!!!,1,"Shany of Houston, TX"
213,"I have only used Airbnb one time, in January 2018. About a week ago - July 2018 I noticed a charge for 156.01 with a confirmation number on my Visa dated June 29. I contacted Airbnb and after taking down my information I was told I would be refunded. When I asked how this would have happened, seeing as how I have no payment options saved on my account and my card hadn’t been compromised. I was told they would only release that information under government subpoena. I’m deleting my account.",1,"Matthew of Krestova, BC"
214,"I found recently especially that as a traveler, you feel intense pressure to only give, at worse, a lukewarm review or none at all. A few things everyone should know... your credit card is ""held hostage"" by Airbnb up to 2 weeks after your stay, in case host wants to accuse you of damages. How do we know they won't come up with some made-up problem if they don't like your review? I currently am debating on how to review a host who I can tell from prior reviews takes GREAT offense at ANY negative comments or suggestions. ",1,"Jane of Carlsbad, CA"

The past year and half I experienced the loss of my father on January 11, 2017, the loss of my mother on January 2, 2018, job loss, fighting for unemployment for months, fighting for jobs, fighting to save my apartment and not get evicted for 8 months straight, having my entire network hacked by a family member who destroyed my business that I put years into building, attacked me in front of my mother 4 days before she went into open-heart surgery... the list goes on.",1,"M. of Hackensack, NJ"

When I call the company they won't even talk to me without me giving them the last 4 digits of my debit card. I will not give them this information - I just had fraud committed on my account, why would I give them more financial information. I just spent another hour on the phone with Sheldon and Arvie and I not absolutely no help. Very sure I will never use this company again.",1,"Cindy of Goldendale, WA"
218,"I rented out my apartment to a guest. He broke a bed. I gathered the evidence that Airbnb required, they agreed to pay. They then rescinded their offer, no explanation. They also kept the damage/breakages insurance from the guest. That seems like fraud to me? Do not trust Airbnb.",1,"Stephen of Stratford Upon Avon, Other"
219,"After reading the 15-- 5 Star post and that the host was a Superhost we decided to Rent 911 Riverview Drive, Bullhead City for 4 nights. In the info pack that was sent we were told that the a/c was to be set to 75 degrees prior to our arrival- home was 96 degrees and a/c was off and it took from 5:30 in the evening until 11:30 at night to get temp down to a balmy 88. There were ants in the house, the flooring was torn out in the Kitchen, dining, living and bedrooms and basically a poorly stained and not very clean concrete floor. The oven (see photo) was one of the dirtiest we have ever come across (also the dishes- see photo) so we fixed no meals at the house (one of the reasons you rent a vacation rental). ",1,"Ron of Temecula, CA"
220,"I booked 3 nights stay with Airbnb in Florida. We stayed at an addition room from the main house, which is the owner live. The host is a nice man, no complaints! The reasons that I am writing this review is about Airbnb. We could not sleep on the first night because of the constant noises from the window ac in the unit, and from the ac condenser on the roof above the unit. We could hear the feel the vibration for the whole night. We tried to turn off the ac unit off, but it was too hot. We decided to leave on the next morning because it will ruin our vacation for the sleepless nights. We contacted the host to let him know our decision and left. We contacted Airbnb to ask for the refund of the remaining nights. They refused and claimed it was our fault to leave. If you are not happy with the products or services, it is our right to refuse to pay, although we were willing to pay for the first sleepless night! Airbnb just lost one customer!",1,"Loc of Garden Grove, CA"
221,"Reserved a place in Seattle two months ago for a trip that is now two weeks away. Got an email yesterday (less than two weeks from planned trip) saying that my background check didn't go through because of a criminal record. I have no criminal record. Needless to say I disputed it through the background check company they use and it was a simple mistake, same name, birthday and state, different person completely. They reversed their background check within two hours and my background check came back clean. ",1,"Joshua of Tallahassee, FL"
222,"We just stayed in the Palmer House in New Orleans. One of the beds was infested with wood beetles. We told our Super Host and she told us “they won’t bother you”. She never said “sorry” or “what can I do to make this right."" What she did say was let me sweep up the sawdust pile the beetles left on the floor. The couple staying in that room slept on the floor the next night. The next day when she saw the air mattress the floor she let us know “that we are from the north and just don’t understand bugs."" Not even an offer to get an exterminator in. Following Airbnb policy, we notified them when the issue happened. They notified the landlord and she promptly ordered us out of her lovely home. She even threatened to call the police. ",1,"Vicki of Medina, OH"
223,Airbnb is the most unprofessional and rude business that I ever came across in my entire life. They cancel people's reservations without advised them and without their approval. They like to spin and span their customers as they're pleased. They cancelled our reservations few days before our vacation to Italy. They were trying to get me for more money and give me different places. Of course a lot more expensive. I would urge you to stay away from these crooked people and please spread the word and let good people know how bad is Airbnb organization. ,1,"Nino of Gilroy, CA"
224,I am very upset and angry with the host referral programme. I have invited 4 hosts. And I have helped them to create their account. I gave a lot of time and effort. They have promised 250 for each hosts and gave only 86 euro for the first 2. And for the other 2 they told me the hosts I referred did not used the link I have sent while I am the one who clicked the links and create the accounts to help them. I really hope developers will create a new and ethical platform for hosts.,1,"Gözde of Athens, Other"
225,"I changed my phone number 3 years ago. Went to login into Airbnb account and from my computer and it said it had to verify my identity by sending me a text to my old phone number. Then locked me out of the account because I don't have that phone. No way to update phone number. No way to contact customer service because account is locked and they cannot be contacted without an account. Contacted them with a new account I created and the only response I got was an apology for how I ""felt"" but they apparently refuse to solve the problem or update the phone number. Two weeks have passed. Nothing. Apparently they are so profitable that servicing their paying customers is no longer a necessity.",1,"Gary of Seattle, WA"
226,"Booked an Airbnb in Los Angeles CA a month before my vacation. My family flew into Las Vegas from MD then drove to Los Angeles, a four hour drive. An hour prior to our arrival the host sends a text stating there are issues with the apartment. He suggests another one of his properties but is smaller that has only has 1 bedroom. The property we originally booked was a 2 bedroom. We opted for another property with a different host. Arrived at the newly booked property and apartment was not as listed. Listing stated king bed in one bedroom, was actually a queen and the other bedroom was listed as a queen, was actually a full bed. Wasn’t impressed with the unit but tried to make it work. ",1,"Kathy of Millersville, MD"
227,"I stayed in a house of an extremely conservative Christian Republican. It was so creepy. I think he had the house bugged and he listened to my conversations although I cannot prove it. He was just ok until he heard me without my knowledge having a conversation with my gay boyfriend. Ever since he stopped talking to me and that made me feel so scared. I thought he was going to kick me with guns and everything. But fortunately, he just ignored me which was good. I don't want to be his friend anyway. But my point is that I felt so anxious and stressed because I didn't know if he was going to act violent or what. I was in the middle of nowhere. I didn't have any motel or neighbors nearby. I wouldn't stay in Airbnb anymore. Just going to a stranger house is scary and you don't know what you are going to get, because the reviews are not always accurate.",1,"Pepito of New Bedford, MA"
228,"I'm a host, Air b and ** is forcing me to take all kinds of people with bad reviews. If I don't take them they penalize me by not showing my property when people search, or they fine me money. Disgusting company. They forcing me to host bad people who don't respect my place or other guests.",1,"James of London, Other"
229,"I've been trying to book an Airbnb for a night in Monterey, CA. Yes, it is a busy weekend and prices are at a premium. But it's the property owner's responsibility to do their own research on pricing. TWICE now I've booked a home and the price has been changed to a much higher rate - it's a bait and switch. The first time, I was TYPING IN MY CREDIT CARD NUMBER and the price TRIPLED while I was typing. Thank goodness I looked at the total one last time before I clicked to purchase. The second time, I booked and PAID FOR the home and got a confirmation and everything. An hour later, Airbnb contacted me and said the owner ""had a calendar mix up"" and now wanted to charge me double the rate I paid. I protested, but Airbnb cancelled my reservation, refunded my money and gave me a $25 coupon. Which I won't be using. I'll stick to hotels from now on, thanks.",1,"Maggie of Atascadero, CA"
230,"I used Airbnb for the first time to book a BNB for a planned trip. Airbnb sent a message stating the ""host"" had accepted the booking and then proceeded to bill my credit card for the booking. I made contact with the ""host"" to finalize the details only to be told they knew nothing about me or my booking. They further stated that they had family issues and were not taking any bookings this year. I have made attempts to contact Airbnb but they have no direct contact available and their site tells me to contact the host for a refund. The host was not paid, and as stated knows nothing about a booking. I am still attempting to obtain a full refund, but Airbnb's site policy states a refund minus their handling fees if I can find out how to contact them. The booking should never have been made by them and their practice is deceitful. They state the booking was accepted, when the ""host"" was not even taking bookings.",1,"George of Anchorage, AK"
231,"My mother signed up for Airbnb with a referral code I sent her. She accidentally entered her email as Gmail when it was another e-mail provider. They then changed the account appropriately but every time we tried to log in with her correct email/which they also had as correct on file it told her to please login with her “wrong email account.” The wrong email wouldn’t work either. There was no way to actually log into her account. We spent 2 hours on the phone Saturday, they route your call to Pakistan where the staff giggles at you under their breath and passively makes it harder to solve the problem (for which at heart they don’t want to fix and they find it funny because they hate westerners) and they just banter off the script and say I’m sorry Mr so and so over and over and I understand your frustration over and over.",1,"Joseph of Long Beach, CA"

When we arrived we found that the units are not as shown in the pictures, the bathrooms had mold, the T.V. did not work at any of the units, there was no hot water in the second unit. The water heater in the second unit was hanging in the bathroom from the ceiling above the sink which is great dangerous and most likely against building code.",1,"Yoel of Los Angeles, CA"
233,"We were deceived by an Airbnb host. We wanted to find a place to stay in Niagara Falls, New York and entered that location in the search field of your website for the 7 of us. We looked at the results returned by the search criteria and located one we liked. We took a look at the property photos and description details and that's what convinced us to choose the property as well as the description stating how close it was to the falls. We knew the property had a strict cancelation policy and thought that wouldn't be an issue since we were not planning to change anything about our planned trip.",1,"Emad-ud-deen of Westford, MA"
234,"My husband and I just recently rented a unit on South Beach Florida. We had some real concerns about our accommodations when we arrived. Definitely not up to par for the money we were paying. After contacting the host, with no response, I called Airbnb customer service. I was lucky enough to have Macie answer the phone. Macie became my case manager and what a great one she is! She contacted the host on our behalf and within thirty minutes there was a call from the host. I will say the Host was quite responsive on fixing some of our concerns. However, in order to correct the problems, we had many people in our pad fixing the problems. ",1,"Vicki of Glen Allen, VA"
235,"I've used Airbnb at least 15 times but NEVER AGAIN. I've never been to New Orleans before and was so excited. Six of my girlfriends and I planned a fun weekend getaway. I booked us a house that listed as ""3 miles from French Quarter"" on Airbnb and paid over $1000 upfront (included $130 cleaning fee and $113 service fee and $45 tax fee).",1,"Karen of Davidson, NC"
236,I am a business professional. I have recently had the most horrible experience with an organization that calls themselves Airbnb. Their customer service representatives are rude and they tell the customers not to be rude to them. In that they will hang up on them if they even raise their voice. They have absolutely no respect for their customers none whatsoever. They cancel reservations on their own not their host but on their own and keep your money for up to three or four weeks before it is refunded. This company actions are criminal. In this organization needs to be investigated by the US government. This is the worst company I have ever dealt with in my life. I have never been so offended by an organization ever in my entire life and I hope that the owners of this organization pray to the good Lord for their souls for their criminal actions against their own customers.,1,"Douglas of Clermont, FL"
237,My husband and myself just had a horrible experience renting a place in Montreal Quebec through AirBNB. The pictures were lovely and the Host was a SuperHost meaning he had great reviews and verified by AirBNB. We found out from a person that works at an AirBNB office that someone could not have all those reviews since 2015. This was a scam artist that hacked into the system and is continuing to hack in as AirBNB keeps sending him or whoever money. We called the Host from the airport as arranged (as I had sent him arrival time previously through AirBNB) with the number AirBNB gave us and it went into some strange language. I tried texting the host who went by the name of Stephane but no response. ,1,"Carol of Shuniah, ON"
238,"I booked and paid for a month stay in Colombia through Airbnb. The host contacted me 22 days before arriving and literally blackmailed me; if I did not paid her an extra $450 dollars, she would cancel my stay and leave me without a place to stay. I DID NOT paid her ransom and I asked AirB&B to cancel my reservation and return my funds so I could make new arrangements. They said they CANNOT cancel the reservation until the fraudulent host do it themselves, YES. ",1,"Santiago of Calgary, AB"
239,"Had a horrible experience during our stay in Barcelona. We were victims of extortion and slander by our host who, out of nowhere, decided to accuse us of stealing from him and demanded compensation. We were completely shocked by his claims and reported him to Airbnb immediately. They were absolutely useless in mediating, especially given the seriousness of the situation. They even allowed him to give us a negative review. Needless to say, we will not be using Airbnb ever again! Once they have your money, they could care less about what happens.",1,"Hector of Minneapolis, MN"
240,"So we’re from Canada and made Airbnb booking in Mission, BC. Contacted the host, she gave me a link where I can continue with my booking, paid for everything, our stay with them was great, very accommodating and nice people. But, the night before we’re going to check out I found out that we’re charged almost $1k for 8 nights. From the receipt that Airbnb sent me, it was only $600++, as I was speaking to their customer service agent they couldn’t figure out why I was charged $732 plus a pending transaction of $181. ",1,"Judy of Calgary, AB"
241,"We had a 4 hour delay checking in because the host never answered, and the management took over four hours. Pressed for a review, I was honest, not mean or unreasonable. They never published my review, so I am unable to trust their reviews. Nothing is all positive.",1,"Ela of Enterprise, AL"
242,"Recently I have had a very unexpected and disappointing experience using Airbnb. I made a booking to stay at a Airbnb in Seville, Spain, but my host cancelled the booking less than a week before our arrival. I did not receive any warning and only found out after logging in to check my Airbnb account. From their troubleshooting web page I was told I was to receive a credit voucher for my inconvenience but I never received any message or email as told on their website. When I went to book a new accommodation, all the prices had on average doubled in price compared to my original booking. But when I went to the check out page when making a new booking, I was happy to see they automatically deducted a credit voucher and charged the difference. But later when I went to check my credit card statement, I was shocked to see they had made another charge without my knowledge. ",1,"Minli of Auckland, Other"
243,"We showed up at dusk to the address. The host did not specify that there was an apartment A and B at the same address. And most of the pictures of the unit were of the outside of the upstairs apartment. We went to the upstairs unit, which was the only one you could see at that time of day. When we tried the door a dog barked at us. I thought we might have the wrong address and had the Uber driver take us what ended up being around the block, where we ended up at the same address. I finally noticed there was a downstairs. It was really dark down there (Sam does not leave the light on for you). I had to turn on my phone and all I could see was a key lock, not the key pad we needed to put in the code.",1,"D of Seabrook, TX"
244,"TWICE I have had reservations cancelled for no reason. The first was when I was relocating for a job. I had a Jeep full of belongings, and the guy who took my money for the week suddenly refunded it before my arrival and took his home off the Airbnb market. The next time, a week after starting my job, the reservation was cancelled again with no notice. I called and spent 30 minutes on the phone with the company only to be told that my account was ""under investigation for privacy"" and that my reservation was ""pending"" even though it had been confirmed (and now showed cancelled). The rep had an accent that made much of what he said unintelligible and when I asked for a supervisor, I got more minutes of hold with no one ever coming to the phone. ",1,"James of Portage, WI"

246,"I live near an Airbnb and they are cropping up all over the neighborhood. I feel like I live in a commercial district with prostitution and drugs coming into the neighborhood from all directions. Temporary renters are loud, smoke pot, have disruptive parties, bring in escorts in mini skirts and don't care about permanent homeowners. Unfamiliar cars are strewn through the streets and loud music blasts until late at night. My neighbor reported renters having sex in the backyard where her girl in Kindergarten was playing.

247,"I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND AIRBNB TO ANYONE!!! I had made a reservation with someone who was supposedly ""quick at responding"" which she wasn't. She was out of the country and it took Airbnb a couple days to hear back from her. Like way to communicate with your guests about your property and services and other questions we had.

They just simply denied the refund as I couldn't provided so called ""evidence""!!!",1,"Airbnb of Scarborough, ON"
251,"I have several homes, and have hosted through Airbnb for several years. I have recruited other hosts, traveled using Airbnb, and have for many years spoken highly of Airbnb. BUT, now I have nothing good to say about the company. It started when I was out of town and a guest came carrying her bed bugs with her. Airbnb would have you believe that they have a policy on your property to help you if you have financial issues with a guest. This is a LIE.",1,"Allison of Okeechobee, FL"
252,"I tried Airbnb a few times now, I don't like the time wasting of making a booking and then a host declines for no good reason, I was hoping it would be a good alternative to hotels as travel all the time, but I just booked a hotel instead of the unreliability of Airbnb.",1,"John of Select Or Enter, NH"
253,"I first used Airbnb in April of 2017. I vacationed to Colorado and it went smooth and ideal. I left a positive review for the host and the host did the same for me. This was nice because after receiving a positive review, I was able to book instantly instead of waiting for owner to approve it. This came in handy for my next vacation, back to Colorado in April 2018 exactly one year later. I book a house for myself and 3 other guests (all of whom were also verified) in the middle of January 2018. I booked early in order to have a nice place to stay.

The host, whose name I don’t know, who doesn’t even have a business website, and who is not very responsive says everything is fixed and that the review was fraudulent? Now a new review comes out yesterday stating there are still missing fire alarms, a leaky ceiling, and the worst of them... BED BUGS?!?!",1,"Crystal of Gilroy, CA"
255,"I have used Airbnb to rent out my rooms not realizing that they are thieves. Airbnb stole money several times. I would host guests for four nights, guest will pay all the money, then Airbnb takes it all. I canceled two reservations due to family bereavement. I explained to Airbnb why I had canceled as I could not host the guests due to two family funerals. Airbnb promised to waived the cancellation and pay me back my money which they never did. Two more bookings were made, I clearly told the guest, I can not check you in coz Airbnb is not paying me for my services. Once again that waived fee was grabbed. Guests stay well clear away from Airbnb, families ask for payment before guest check in like any other hotel does! Airbnb are blood thieves! BEWARE!!!",1,"Beauty of Colchester, Other"
256,"I rented a place in Napa Valley for my honeymoon and told the hosts exactly when I would be arriving and kept messaging them with updates. When I asked about a code to get in, they said I should just ring the doorbell. When we got to the rental, they were not there and had not sent over any instructions on how to get in. We called and called and waited and then eventually decided to leave and try to find a place to stay. Airbnb would not refund me for this, and when I disputed it with Bank of America, they refused the refund. I did not stay at the rental and did my part in showing up. I do not understand how I am not entitled to a refund. I will go with hotels from now on.",1,"Reema of Suwanee, GA"
257,"My host decided to cancel my reservations 9 days prior to my stay in order to extend another customer's stay. What is Airbnb doing to protect its users like me who are booking through them? Nothing. They offered me $15.00 extra on top of a full refund to help re-book another Airbnb place or just refund all my money back into my credit card. They left ""host cancelled"" on the host's page, charge them a cancellation fee of $50.00 that benefits them and drop the super host. The worst part was that I wasn't able to leave a review of the host that cancelled on me.",1,"Ydnic of Tacoma, WA"
258,"Airbnb is a joke!!! Not helpful at all. The ""customer service"" reps do not deserve to be paid for the poor service they provide. It's like a three-ring circus. The company advertises falsely.

Suddenly, last week, I get an email that our reservation has been canceled and our deposit returned. No explanation given, and when I emailed the host, he did not respond. I called Airbnb to say how upset I was and was told someone would expedite the issue and call me back.

262,"We've had a about twenty guests so far on Airbnb. The only issues that have come up is how Airbnb posts guest verification information and their lack of understanding of how it is viewed. We require a government ID from the guest to be provided to Airbnb and look for that information on the person's picture. When we drill down, several items are listed but infrequently, the government ID verification is not there. As a result, I have contacted the guest and Airbnb to find out what the story is. Almost without fail, Airbnb insists they are verified although I can find no proof thereof.",1,"Russ of Tucson, AZ"
263,"Airbnb offers absolutely no protection for the customers in case the homeowner decides to cancel the booking. Even if you have reserved your place and paid all the money, there's no guarantee whatsoever that the owner will keep it for you, up till the very day of your stay. In my case, the homeowner of a NYC apartment deliberately canceled my booking 2 weeks before my $1400 worth stay, so I had to urgently seek a hotel in the vicinity - which turned out to cost me $700 more. On their end, Airbnb couldn't do much, and after a painstaking phone call with their customer representative, the best they could do was to offer me a paltry $15 discount on my ""NEXT"" stay. NEXT STAY?! Well, they are bold enough to think I will ever go back to their website again after that shameful incident.",1,"Olga of Costa Mesa, CA"
264,"When I first signed up with AIRBNB I was excited. I had heard good things. As I used the service more, I started encountering discrimination due to traveling with a toddler in Phoenix area of AZ. One host kicked me out after one night without proper notice because my child was fussy. I was paying 100 dollars per night. When I asked him his name as I was checking in he answered me like he was someone in authority. Not friendly or down to earth. I have had two hosts accuse me of being extremely messy and in violation of house rules. ",1,"Christine of Carefree, AZ"
265,"It is hard to understand how Airbnb stays in business with their non-existent customer service and total lack of concern for people simply trying to do business with them. I chose an available property, emailed the property owner and submitted my payment information. After giving all of my info, I got a vague popup notice from Airbnb saying there was some problem in accepting my credit card information advising me to use their HELP desk if I wanted immediate help. Of course I wanted immediate help, I am trying to book a property for a vacation and the clock is ticking. I tried submitting my credit card information again, getting the same error message. I tried using another credit card and got the same error message.",1,"Steven of San Antonio, TX"
266,"In what other business, are you allowed to charge half the fee within SECONDS of a person hitting the ""request"" button... and it's non-refundable.

Airbnb is nothing more than a free-for-all platform that doesn't protect the consumers who use it.",1,"Frances of New York, NY"
267,"We have used Airbnb for a couple of trips and have had a great experience. Both hosts commented about how quiet we were and how clean we left everything. So we were shocked to receive a refund for the property with no explanation as to why the reservation had been canceled. In December or January, I booked a townhouse in La Jolla for June, as we will be attending a wedding in the area. Now, with the wedding soon approaching, we have to scramble to find accommodations. Airbnb should have the courtesy to tell us why our reservation is canceled. I will not be booking with them, again, any time soon.

I received a gift card after I made the reservation and contacted customer service to see if I could apply the gift card toward the remaining balance. They put me on hold for 5-7 minutes and came back saying I could not, I had to pay the rest with credit card. I said that was ridiculous and unacceptable, let me speak with someone that could help me. They said no one could help me. ",1,"Noah of San Diego, CA"
271,"My experience similar to others below. Booked a room, but when checked in, place was filthy, it looked like someone else was living there unregistered, and generally had a really creepy feel. Couldn't stay there, but when attempting to get refund from Airbnb, they will always defer to the host. Because I didn't have enough documentation, they wouldn't give me a total refund. I actually had pictures of the dirty bathroom clearly showing dirty linens, but they claimed they couldn't see anything. So you take a big risk - if your host is a good one, you're lucky. If they're not and misrepresent their place, you're on your own - the host can just lie to Airbnb and they'll defer to them - they are host-friendly, not renter friendly. Not for lone travelers concerned about safety - residence mentioned above (""Parsa"", in Northridge, CA) would have been unsafe, because host never showed up with a key, and there were unregistered guests.",1,"Chad of Clovis, CA"
272,"Booked the entire first week at a cottage in Sarasota, Florida. Place was filthy but since it was Easter weekend AND spring break there was nowhere else to go. Host refuses to acknowledge her place was filthy and publicly called us nitpicky as well as flat-out lied to Airbnb about us. Airbnb has completely ignored our complaints to them even when we pointed out that the host received 2 more 5 star reviews from other people during the same time we were at the property! Since we had the whole property to ourselves, I am curious where these other guests were staying. It's a scam and I will never use Airbnb again and I will tell everyone who will listen about our experience. The name of the cottage is ""Bayou Get-Away Cabin"" in Sarasota, Florida.",1,"Kelly of Welland, ON"
273,"This is for all the folks that has ever thought about using Airbnb.com. I just left a place that was too nasty to stay in. Because I didn't cancel before check in, I only got a sixth of what I paid refunded. Because I canceled I can't leave a review. Keep that in mind when you see awesome reviews. Perhaps current photos of the bathroom would be wise to ask for in advance. As a disclaimer, my first two experiences were great, the last two has been so awful. I will never use this again.",1,"jeni of Plain City , UT"
274,"DON'T USE Airbnb! I requested to book a 3-bed apartment that by the description and pictures on Air BnB looked wonderful. The host asked me to confirm the ages of the people traveling with me before he confirmed the booking. I did just as he asked. He then confirmed the booking, charging my credit card. 5 minutes later he messages me and tells me I will have to share 2 beds and the place is under renovation, unsafe for teenagers. I told him immediately that would not work. Then he tried to backtrack and say it's not really under construction but the rooftop was unsecured and not safe for teenagers. He knew I was traveling with teenagers as he had asked me twice. I told him I booked the place for the view and the fact it had 3 beds. He told me too bad if I cancel. It's my choice and there is no cancelation so I still pay. I canceled immediately. ",1,"Melanie of Lehi, UT"
275,"For the first time I wanted to book an apartment with Airbnb in San Diego downtown but ended with a bad experience. The apartment is given in my search results when I searched for the listings with 2 adults plus 2 children. Airbnb showed this apartment as 'Rare found' and also showed a beautiful view of the downtown as if it is from the apartment. When we actually checked in the apartment, it is not at all child-friendly apartment, no child lock, our 2 year old can easily open the main door and go out, also scary patio from where you can see the down floors from the rails which got the big spaces. There is no view at all from the apartment.",1,"Srinivas of Newark, CA"
276,"Upon gaining access to the rental site we discovered a leaking kitchen ceiling, dangling light fixtures in kitchen and bathroom and no working lights in any living areas. Within a half hour we notified the host that the premises were unsafe and unacceptable and we were canceling. We had to go to a hotel for the 7day trip; this cost a great deal more. Within 12 hours we notified Airbnb of the situation and they assigned a customer support ""agent"" to work on the case. We indicated we were not going to cancel on the Airbnb website because, per their policy statement, doing so within 24 hours of our rental would result in forfeiture of all fees. He assured us ""we were doing the right thing"". A day later Airbnb said they would only refund half the rental/cleaning fees with the other half going to the host! It was obvious that Airbnb kept their service fees and tried to serve two masters, satisfying none!",1,"Nicholas of Woolwich, ME"
277,"After the host of our reservation, I tried to work with a case manager to find a new host, but had a nightmare. Case managers as well as supervisors didn’t call me back for days, on multiple occasions. We ended up having to get a hotel and I was told by a case manager she could reimburse me up to $200 to help cover the difference in the cost of the hotel and my reservation. A supervisor then reneged on that and wouldn’t give me a dime. The supervisor also took several days off while we were trying to resolve this, without notifying me, which would be fine except Airbnb wouldn’t let another case manager or supervisor help. Be prepared to work around their schedules rather than them working around ours. Or just don’t do business with them, I never will again.",1,"Wade of South Bend, IN"
278,"My friends and I booked an apartment with Airbnb about 2 months in advance. When we arrived, it was a scam. The apartment had been rented out to another group. Airbnb support did nothing to help us and did not take our situation seriously. They stranded 3 young females in a foreign city and have refused to refund the $173 we spend on the rental. DO NOT USE this company!",1,"Diana of Littleton, CO"
279,"My wife, two year old daughter and I stayed in Miami last year using one of Airbnb's listings. Upon arriving, the unit had an over flooded bathroom and disgusting sheets. The property manager kept moving us from one unit to the other to accommodate his other guests, and when we complained he threatened us - taking advantage of our situation with a child - and told us any complaints will make us end up on the streets. Airbnb made us leave the location for our safety, and the matter was considered resolved when we were offered a coupon to use and in return we would not file an official complaint with authorities. We now want to use this coupon (which is under my wife's name), but my wife is unable to travel. Airbnb refused to have me use the coupon which expires in 1 month, thus rendering the situation unresolved. We wasted our vacation and money, and it seems like legal action should have been the right solution.",1,"Ashraf of Winchester, MA"
280,"As a host I have brought many concerns to the staff of Airbnb over the years only to be contradicted or told that ""nothing can be done"" about my issues. The latest of them concerned a very satisfied couple who had stayed with us for 3 nights prior to leaving on a cruise. When they returned, they were very disappointed to learn that their 5 star review was not accepted because it exceed the Airbnb's timeframe for reviews of 14 days from the close of their stay. THEY WERE ON A CRUISE! They were having fun and they figured they'd wait till they were back in the comfort of their own home to compose a nice review. No such luck...another one of Airbnb's ridiculous policies (of which there are many more).",1,"Caesar of Wilton Manors, FL"
281,"Two days before my travel date, Airbnb canceled my reservation because of a past offense in the background check. I’ve been renting from different hosts for a year, given and received positive reviews, never had complaints from hosts, and never had issues with them. Even though I got a refund, I still have to scramble to find a place to stay at the last minute. I did not attempt to contact Airbnb because I’ve read that they give no help or response to people whose accounts they deactivated or banned. Airbnb say they don’t discriminate, but they judge people by their past. An offense 10 years ago will get you banned. It’s only a matter of time.",1,"Terence of San Antonio, TX"
282,"I have been cancelled by Airbnb twice as an active guest in less than 30 days. I booked one In San Francisco then another to Jenner beach For the remainder of my stay in Cali to visit my sick mother. Less than 1 week of my travel dates I get an email cancelling my Jenner Beach reservation that has been charged to my account/cc already. Instead of telling the truth that someone made a mistake of posting such the wrong price instead they tried to claim that the host was contacting me outside the website. Which is a lie, because the host never responded to me but manage to approve only the reservation with no words of hey or how. “Deep breath house” hosted by Jacqui. ",1,"LAILANI of Concord , GA"
283,"Booked a vacation on my debit card, instead of my credit card which overdrew my account. I got the notification within 2 seconds of clicking confirm on Airbnb and called them immediately (waited on hold for 15 minutes before talking to someone). I asked if they could stop the transaction and if I could just give a new credit card number. They said no, they could not. I asked if they could cancel the booking and just rebook over the phone with a different credit card, they told me I had to cancel online and rebook but pay all the cancellation fees. What a ** joke! So I had to spend an hour out of my workday to drive up to my boyfriend's work, get his card, withdraw money from his account, go to my bank, make the deposit to cover the overdraft. Such a hassle!",1,"Ashley of Encinitas, CA"
284,"They keep your money if you cancel a transaction. Instead of sending your money back to the credit card, they keep it as a COUPON. If you don't check and don't ask, the ""coupon"" aka your money expires after 1 year and you lose it!!! Also, if you see a room but are not sure and don't book it, when you get back, the price is much higher. The taxes they charge the host and the guest are not clear. I spoke to hosts who told me they were charged much more. WE NEED SOME AGENCY TO INVESTIGATE AIRBNB.",1,"Roberto of Bronx, Other"
285,This past week I had a tenant stop their monthly payment to Airbnb and skip out in the middle of the night. This violates my cancellation policy. Airbnb told me they would take care of the money and that particular Airbnb staff member never documented anything. The second Airbnb staff member said after three attempts to collect they would send the case to collections. That was several days ago and of course Airbnb has no phone number that they can give me to talk to the collections department. I am receiving no support or assistance in spite of their claims that they do so. Homeowner beware. If the tenant skips out it does not appear that Airbnb provides any assistance with collecting the rent.,1,"Marie of La Mesa, CA"
286,"I purchased a week April 6-9 and then a month June 6- July 6 of rooms for my wife and I's honeymoon (out of country). That was a little over two months ago. I woke up this morning to an email saying that every one of my rooms had been refunded. I leave tomorrow so I did the natural thing and panicked. I tried to log into my account but could not. I then received an email stating that not only was my account deleted but that I'm also screwed out of all my reservations. Turns out that, my probation that I had completed on deferred judification made it where, I did meet their requirements to stay with any of the lodgings.",1,"John of Liberty Hill, TX"
287,I booked an apartment through Airbnb for an extended stay in Italy. The host could not meet for check-in because he stated he was going to be out of town. I had a friend that lived locally to pick up the keys for me. My stay was shortened due to credit card fraud. I left the key with the same person that picked them up since he was not available for checkout. The host called me at 2am demanding keys which I did not have. I was already out of the country but the host wanted me to call his relatives to make arrangements. A few hours after that call I received a bill for over $500.00 to have a lock replaced.,1,"Suzanna of Las Vegas, NV"
288,"We stayed in ""Ueno Sharehouse for Backpackers"" last March 21, 2018. We checked out at 10 am the next day. At around 2:30 pm, host is accusing us of breaking the cup/glass in which we even did not use as we have our own bottled water. Host is asking us to pay additional JPY 800. We appealed to Airbnb and the only thing they said is: ""We feel this is fair as your host reported the damage before the next guest checked in"". Clearly, they just take the side of the host. They did not review the guests' appeal carefully. What if the host is just doing that for its random guests just to take extra money.",1,"Joanne of Santa Rosa, Other"
289,"I have stayed at various Airbnb places over several years, and while most all of them have been ok or some very nice, others simply do not live up to what is advertised and end up being ""disasters"". And when there have been OBVIOUS issues with customer service and the places...i.e. filthy carpets, bathroom and zero amenities as you would expect from a bnb...oh wait, even the name is Airbnb, I am told that many places are just rooms in homes for rent with many other permanent renters already living there. Not really bnb's. Well, that is false advertising. ",1,"Fabian of Grants Pass, OR"
290,I was headed to Columbia for a bachelor party. Booked the wrong place due to location and also a friend that visited the location and informed me the looks were nothing like the pictures. Also was in a unlicensed building. So I called claims and tried to cancel. Airbnb informed it was the host decision and of course the host declined due to very little bookings. The full payment was 9k. They took 50 percent. I cancelled 30 minutes after booking. Their claims manager took days to respond and took the side of the host. I live check to check and they wouldn’t even accommodate a common mistake. Their concern is for their hosts not their guests because that’s their money maker. They by far have the worst customer service information. I will be reporting them to the Better Business Bureau and recommend that no one use this company. Please spread the word.,1,"Nathanil of Cerritos, CA"
291,"I booked an apartment on Airbnb 3 months ago. Apartment was shown available on Airbnb. Just after booking and paying I got information from host, that it was a mistake and apartment was overbooked. Airbnb didn't help to refund my money. Above all they refused to refund service fee, even though they wrongly offered an already booked room. Fortunately I had a honest host who refunded me completely. Comment of Airbnb: ""It's illegal!!"" NEVER AGAIN. I deleted my account. Can't recommend Airbnb.",1,"Thomas of Wallisellen, Other"
292,"I feel that the main problem with Airbnb is that it allows a lot of bad hosts to get business that they would otherwise not get if not for the visibility that the Internet provide them. Many bad hosts are just very good at manipulating their image and reviews on the Internet so that they can take advantage of guests to make a quick profit. I am referring to the hosts which most guests would not decide to choose if they had been able to see the place in person, that is, in those cases where there are pretty obvious gaps between perception and reality. I also had hosts giving me false names, contact information, or pretending to be medical doctors or something else about them difficult to verify and I was surprised to find out that there is no Airbnb policy to discourage that. On the other hand though, Airbnb policies are tough on guests. Not fair. Airbnb policies are too biased in favor of hosts in my opinion.",1,"Steve of Toronto, ON"
293,"When I booked my accommodation with Airbnb I saw the big print ""Free Cancellation"" (up to a week before arrival). Unfortunately, I didn't read the fine print that the cancellation does not apply to the service fee. Very disappointing that no watchdog is reviewing this type of deceptive practice. What would it take to have small print directly near the words Free Cancellation? Unfortunately, Airbnb has several ways to hide information that they don't want others to see.",1,"Klaus of Vancouver, BC"
294,"Airbnb Hawaii. A ""charming cottage"" from hell at AirBnB. We sweated it (never used Airbnb before and won’t again) it as the owner would not release the address until the day before. As a group of three (one being my 18 year old son) we came to Oahu on business in Sept 2016 for 18 days. We felt getting a group lodging might be less expensive compared to getting 2-3 hotel rooms in Waikiki.",1,"Al of Murrieta, CA"
295,"This is the original email I sent to Airbnb after I called them and they asked me to type up my complaint. ""I will send pics to follow after this email. I wanted to first describe the experience with Joseph in Siesta Key. This was a two day reservation totaling $3650. It was a completely overrated stay. This is a 1.8 million dollar house that should have been in pristine condition. There were many red flags upon arriving. But upon arrival we overlooked some looking forward to a weekend for my best friend of 20 yrs getaway before she gets married. So rather than a bridal shower we decided to find a place to stay where we could all gather and hang out without going anywhere. This house was definitely not what we expected. There were Cheerios on the floor by the front door. Fingerprints on all the siding glass doors. It was clear the countertops of the kitchen were not wiped down before our stay dispute the $250 cleaning fee that is required.",1,"Angelica of Lutz, FL"
296,My business partner booked 2 different accommodations for a week long trip in London. Both locations were rated as 5 stars and both were unacceptable-less than 1 star. I could not stay at either for fear of bedbugs or worse. As a woman I feared for my safety in both locations. Both reservations were cancelled upon arrival and yet we charged full price for both locations. Airbnb's response to resolve the issue was equally unacceptable. We were forced to pay for the full 5 nights even though we cancelled and did not stay in either then we had to find last minute hotels at 350CDN a night. The stress was unbelievable. I will never recommend Airbnb to anyone. Hotels have spent years gaining their stars whereas any Joe can operate a bug infested rooming house. Call it a house with a private room for rent and have who knows who to write up phoney reviews for them. BUYER BEWARE. Airbnb is a scam.,1,"Barbara of Beaumont, AB"
297,Airbnb will take your money when it should be refunded. I was not informed where the keys were located to enter my reservation so I cancelled with the host before I arrived due to not feeling safe to travel there without an understanding of how to securely lock the unit. I did not stay there for reason of safety and the lame customer service and host decided to keep my money and ignore the good faith effort to cancel before I arrived and my concerns for safety. Do not trust Airbnb... They will steal your money and they have hosts who ignore obvious reason to refund money.,1,"Brenda of Ross, CA"
298,"I was a host on Airbnb with 7 apartments in the busiest location in the world for 2016- Osaka, Japan. Over the course of 3 years, I gradually scaled down the operation to just 1 and transferred to different website. Just now, I removed my last apartment from Airbnb and I cannot describe how relieved do I feel now, when I don't need to deal with these ** anymore. At first, they had great customer service and call centers. Then the sudden expanding of the company caught them unprepared for the size of their operation and the problems they haven't thought could appear. All in all, partnering with them cost me a lot of money, loss of business partners and respect from local community. They would randomly take side with clients, trying to cancel reservations with BS excuses, so they will not have to pay cancellation fee.",1,"Ivaylo of Varna, Other"
299,"So I recently put I a report for Airbnb, happily they are going to refund me. I still do not plan on using them in the future... This is a copy of their reply. I hope this is helpful to others... If you. have a problem with a refund dont give up.",1,"Shanie of Hernando Beach, FL"
300,"Airbnb refused to refund what I paid for renting a condo unit that was not suitable for rent or even for staying in it for one free night. We paid near 150 USD for three nights and I got refunded only 40 USD. I had both legal and ethical reasons to cancel upon checking in and viewing the place: The only aircon in the large condo was not working properly. The host representative who checked us in advised us to just restart the aircon every time it ""dies"" and it did stop within 10 minutes after we checked in. The host expected us to get up throughout the night to restart the aircon when it ""dies"". The host later denied what her rep told us and claimed that the aircon was working fine, although two people witnessed what the rep said. ",1,"Samuel of Sanford, NC"
301,"The house was supposed to sleep 8 and only slept 6, it was supposed to be 15 min from French Quarter, it was 30 and sometimes more depending on traffic. The refrigerator did not work so all our food ruined and the owner never sent anyone out. The garbage disposal was also broken. We had to buy a air mattress and ice chest which was an extra expense and time from our vacation. Then a code enforcement officer shows up and says that this Home is being rented out illegally! I will never use Airbnb again!",1,"April of Fort Worth, TX"
302,"I had a reservation at this room from 3/9- 3/12. We could only stay one night because the conditions were so deplorable. We were promised a rollaway bed and air mattress because there were 3 men staying. When we checked in neither was there upon check in, they finally dropped off air mattress with no blankets or pillows, then it didnt fit on the floor flat as room was too small, bathroom was full of mold, tiles caved in and falling off walls. These are not safe or healthy living conditions. They refused to refund me for the night we could not stay, they also refused to refund me for a future stay 6 months from now!! Do not use this company!",1,"Charles of Orlando, FL"
303,"On the 11th of March, I booked an apartment in Poland. The response of the host was that the price was higher for the period (Christmas) that I booked. I filed a complaint at Airbnb stating that the EU Directive for Consumer Rights does not allow traders to change prices. It states: ""Traders are obliged to display correct and complete pricing information before a customer makes a purchase online"". Additionally, Article 7.12. of the terms and conditions of Airbnb for hosts states: ""You are solely responsible for setting a price (including any Taxes if applicable) for your Listing (“Listing Fee”). Once a guest requests a booking of your listing, you may not request that the guest pays a higher price than in the booking request.""",1,"Ralph of Nieuwegein, Other"
304,"I don't know if Airbnb recently outsourced their call center or what but their service has gone way downhill. As a host that has two properties on Airbnb and VRBO I used to think Airbnb was much easier to do business with but that is not the case anymore. They changed my cancellation policy without notice, they've refunded my guests without consulting me, and after 5 years and hundreds of thousands of $ in bookings, they recently notified me that I am at risk of having my account suspended for ""only"" having a 4.7 Star rating while 81% of 170 reviews are 5 Star reviews. Besides the fact that math does not work, I'm not sure it's possible to get much better rating than 4.7 and I don't appreciate being their aggressive and condescending threats. They are so tone deaf and their customer service sucks. Better to use VRBO as host or traveler.",1,"John of Santa Cruz, CA"
305,"Mark, my ""host"" in London, was exceptionally aggressive when we were a few minutes late checking out, and has now left patiently false feedback regarding our stay that I am afraid will prejudice future hosts.

We left without comment.",1,"Philip of Vienna, VA"
306,When I first started using Airbnb I felt their services were excellent. In the last year I have noticed a complete change of customer service toward hosts. Last night trying to resolve a very simple problem of a guest requesting staying another night and trying to pay - it took 3 hours and at least 5 people to talk to. I was actually yelled at by one rep and told I should not charge them at all! Excuse me - why the heck not! I had some guests who were just filthy and had the house smelling like a garbage can.,1,"Donna of San Jose, CA"
307,My family and I rented a condo through Airbnb which got broken into. The owner did nothing about it or the items that we had lost so we wrote a review on his page. He flagged it and it got removed. We followed the company’s review policy and did not violate it. I have lost confidence in Airbnb if they will not allow the negative posts along with the positive ones. How will future guests ever know that their safety or personal property can be compromised at this location? Very poor judgment by Airbnb!,1,"Audrey of Decatur, IL"

On the third day, we came back from an all-day fishing trip and several of our electronic and personal items had been stolen from the condo, approx $1800. Property owner strongly discouraged us from calling the police, advising that he would check it out. He did absolutely nothing. Airbnb would not accept our review due to their policy that no negative feedback is allowed. We will not recommend Airbnb because they do not allow honest reviews that reflect negatively on their property owners, even when it involves theft and personal safety.",1,"Carolyn of Bloomfield, NM"
309,"I have always been a pleasant guest at any Airbnb I've stayed at, and have never had a single negative review.

310,"The customer service is now past terrible. Airbnb is making adjustments on payments on their own, holding payments and doing it in a sinister manner where host and co-host are each unaware of each other's transaction which makes it easy for the payments disappear. Airbnb didn't honor a simple cancellation policy more than just once. Today I find out that I have a guest coming in few days, but I'm gonna end up owing Airbnb 250$+ after all transaction, because they claim I may owe them some money from March 2017??? If you are one of those owners that need to know when and how you are getting paid, this is gonna be nerve racking altogether.",1,"Mike of Lancaster, CA"
311,Airbnb has denied to pay any money to me against the guest insurance claim. The house where I stayed burned to the ground which was caused by overheated wiring in the walls due to improper installation. I have been chasing Airbnb customer care for past 2 months and finally they have sent an email saying that they do not pay insurance for these type of incidents. If not for FIRE incident then I am curious for what type of incidents they pay the insurance and why they charge money for insurance. This incident could have been avoided if proper inspection was done by Airbnb. The American guests who stayed at the same house got the insurance money from Airbnb 3 weeks ago without any pain. This is a complete torture and racial discrimination by Airbnb. Please advise what I can do in this country as an immigrant to claim for my loss. I can share more proofs on request.,1,"Priya of Seattle, WA"
312,"Even if this is very convenient and looks like a great idea at the beginning, it becomes increasingly frustrating to USE Airbnb... and I say USE for a good reason, because there is NO consumer respect from this organisation, it feels like you are dealing with a machine.

The earliest response you may expect from support is at least 8 hours - if you are lucky and have enough time to talk to a case manager.",1,"Emre of Toronto, ON"
315,DO NOT BOOK WITH AIRBNB. We booked a reservation with a host SEVEN months in advance. We went to confirm our stay with the host a week before leaving and they said they were not going to honor our reservation. Apparently they were not allowed to offer Airbnb in the residence anymore. They failed to tell us that. So we call Airbnb and request a refund and compensation to pay for a hotel (as we are 4 days from the trip - spring break in Cancun) they offer TEN PERCENT of the original stay. Trying to find a place to stay in this location and time is IMPOSSIBLE AND EXPENSIVE. I guess their customer service thinks that an extra $40 is enough to pay for a last minute reservation. THEN the refund was supposed to take 5-10 days when we leave in 4... Only after talking to 4 customer service reps and a manager was I able to get an extra $100 (which I'm not even sure I will be getting). ,1,"Cassie of Duluth, MN"
316,"We booked a stay of just under one month at Martin’s “Trendy family apt with parking next to city center” last October.

This was followed by ferries, hotels en route, etc.  A week before our departure date, Martin sent me an email stating that the apartment was no longer available, but due to him being a ‘Superhost’, he needed me to cancel it because otherwise he’d lose this status.

319,I FEEL ROBBED - Airbnb claims that a host should be worry free of damage done by a guest. WRONG! They will NOT Pay me for extreme damage that my guest has also admitted to me through messages that I showed them. They are telling me to resort through other options and wished me future luck with future guests. Their responses came on graveyard hours which is a scam because they only give a week to get estimates. I gave them an estimate from a reputable contractor that is licensed and sent them the messages from the guest and it still wasn’t enough for them. Scam company. Do not use them unless you are prepared to pay for any and all damages. This is the third time I’ve had damage and not one was paid. Enough is enough. I will no longer be hosting for a company that doesn’t take responsibility. Avoid from hosting!,1,"Rio of Carmichael, CA"

321,When Airbnb changed their calendar format it cancelled all my blocked dates. I did not know about this until a guest made a booking on a blocked date. Of course I had to regret and apologize to the guest. Airbnb only arrogantly warned me that they would remove my listing if it happened again. I explained what had happened but no apology... US companies never apologize... must be their lawyers. Also I get guests that ask for contact information and I have to tell them that Airbnb does not allow it. Airbnb puts all the onus on the hosts. Their model is good but fading fast. I would love to have other business to work with.,1,"Al of Shemlan, Other"
322,"Last year during the summer I rented an RV in Winter Haven in order to take the family to Legoland. We arrived at the RV and from outside it seemed nice next to a pond. We stepped inside the RV and the family got hit in the face with a poop stench. We couldn’t get ahold of the owner until a few hours later. Wife and kids couldn’t breathe because of the horrific ODOR emitting from the toilet which engulfed the entire RV. Finally, we jumped back into our car and drove to a nearby hotel.",1,"Miguel of Pompano Beach, FL"
323,"The biggest crooks and the worst business ever. They removing reviews of bad guests with no reasons because they know bad reviews gonna demolish people accounts and they not gonna use Airbnb and go to hotels, because hosts wouldn't host them. It happened at least 3 times with me when Airbnb always could find something in my negative review to guest that violates their policy. The last case was literally catching off guard when the guy who stayed in our hostel made a drama on his last night staying when police almost came over because the girl he hang out with accused him in putting illegal substances in the drink and this screwed up idiot lost his wallet under the bed accusing people in stealing it. We saved that idiot from police almost coming for him because we talked to the girl and calmed her down. ",1,"Sergii of Miami Beach, FL"
324,I would give it a zero if I could. The room at the Fontainebleau that was reserved 6 mos in advance and paid in full with receipt and reservation number was not cancelled by the owner the day of arrival. We flew across the country for Valentine's weekend and now I am now fighting to get my money back for a room that didn't exist.,1,"Gary of San Clemente, CA"
325,"Found a great home on Whidbey Island ""Anchors away"" right on the beach. Will be there for a wedding later this summer. After inputting all my info, they then decide my ID is not a match with my picture. Hello. That's me. What can you do? They thought it was OK enough to take my $1000 payment for the rental! Then cancelled my reservation at 2 am the next morning, stating they couldn’t ID me! Never called, never gave me a chance to submit another picture.",1,"Colette of Stevensville, MT"
326,"Rented home in Cape Coral, Florida thru Airbnb. The host was Michelle of MHB Property Management. The house **. When we arrived we couldn't get in. The host had to be called, the host didn't return the call. Another person we had not dealt with did, after we go in there were no directions to operate the pool or hot tub. Again we called the host but no one returned our call, the stove was leaking gas so bad the women were scared to use it (very dangerous situation). The maid service left a note apologizing for not completing the cleaning of the house which we paid $325.00 for the cleaning service. Contacted Airbnb and the host company and they blew us off because THEY WERE ALREADY PAID! Sad state of affairs!",1,"Terry of Gaylord, MI"
327,We rented a house from Airbnb for 3 days. The description never said it was a trailer/modular home. First arrived and there was a garage right by the back patio. Man came out wearing a pair of jeans and no shirt. He was not the host. He worked most of the day. Customer service said that since I didn’t have a picture of the man it was out of their hands. Dining room light was missing 3 light bulbs and kitchen ceiling fluorescent light did not work. Call host and they brought us over light bulbs but kitchen light was never fixed. Pulled a baking pan out and it was full of rust. Stove burners did not work. There was food under the couch cushions. Description said House was walking distance to wineries. Not true. Contacted customer service when I got home to requests refund and sent them some of the pictures I took. ,1,"Monica of Lapalma, CA"
328,"I booked a place for my husband to stay for a month. What transpired was horrible. The place was cluttered. The bed had missing planks and you fell through sometimes. Fridge was filthy. The worst part was the bathtub screen was broken, so to get in and out of the bathtub/shower you had to sit on a ledge and squish your feet around. My husband hurt his back getting out and he finally checked out. The air conditioner doesn't work in the room he booked and in Australian heat this is unacceptable.",1,"Anne of Docklands, Other"
329,Last week I booked a place for my family to stay for a week through Airbnb. After a couple of hours I received my reservation confirmation. Within a few minutes I received a text from the owners stating that the amount was not right and that it would be several hundred more dollars per night if I wanted to stay there. I thought it was some kind of a scam! I had to leave my home for the evening within a few minutes of getting this text. I thought I would wait and see if anything more would come of it. When I got home I immediately went to bed. After I was asleep someone from Airbnb called me and woke me up. I heard them say something about an emergency. I said I was sleeping and they had woken me up. And I knew it was not an emergency!,1,"Garnet of Backus, MN"
330,I was part of an adult and professional family who rented an expensive house through AIRBNB for four weeks so I speak from bitter and first hand experience. On both sides of the house we rented through AIRBNB there were major construction works being carried out. Let me be clear - these were not renovations or extensions or repairs - but brand new builds. THEY DID NOT COME ABOUT AFTER OUR BOOKING BUT WERE KNOWN TO THE HOST AT THE TIME OF BOOKING. They were major building sites - in what was described as a quiet residential area. At NO time whatsoever did the host point this issue out to us. The overriding comment I am making is this. Problems within a rented AIRBNB can crop up after the 24 hour period. They do not always happen within the first 24 hours.,1,"Joan of Hebden Bridge, Other"
331,"I recently went on our first trip to Europe, just my 10 year old and myself. One stop was in Denmark for 3 days in December. The apartment we rented from Jaroslav and Lina ** had no heat and wasn't as described. Upon entering, there was an unusual smell, but we just figured that different countries cook different foods and not every place smells like home.",1,"Cristie of Leetsdale, PA"
332,We have had 2 cancellations with Airbnb. Last one they had $2000 of our money for almost 5 months and cancelled with no interest or bonus at all. Of course no other places or I would have picked them initially. We booked VRBO for years and never had an issue.,1,"Darlene of Regina, SK"
333,"My daughter and I both tried to take pictures of our government issued IDs and our faces, in order that we might make a reservation. We are not stupid. We have both graduated from high school which should be all one would need in order to fill out a reservation. In addition, we have between us two Bachelor of Art degrees, two Master degrees, and one Ph. D. But could we make a reservation? Why no, we couldn't. It seems neither of us was capable of taking pictures that were up to Airbnb's standards.",1,"Judy of Brooklyn, NY"
334,"Very troublesome and deceitful - I booked an accommodation with AirBnB. They sent a confirmation number confirming complete and paid reservation. The next morning they canceled my reservation, saying I needed a new photo and government ID. They should not have confirmed and charged me if they didn't have all the information they required. This happened once before as well.",1,"Pamela of Rockport, MA"
335,"I was a host on Airbnb and the guest completely ruined my home. I wrote a negative review of the guest but Airbnb removed it. Airbnb does not what negative reviews to impact your profit margin. That means you don't see negative reviews of guests, Which means you are unprotected. That means that guest will destroy someone else's home. Airbnb is unethical and hypocritical. They talk about community but it's a lie.",1,"Ann of Dundas, ON"

338,"My family and I wanted to visit Montreal for 3 days and decided to book a place through Airbnb, instead of paying for hotel. The booking process was easy and simple as usual, so no problem there. The day we were supposed to arrive, our host told us that there is a leak in his condo and is unable to host us. He was extremely nice and offered us a free stay at another condo, however we wanted something different so we declined the offer. We went on Airbnb AGAIN, because we thought we just had a bad luck and it was nobody's fault.",1,"Natalia of Ottawa, ON"
339,I am a homeowner listing on Airbnb. Their customer service is horrible. My listing is corrupted so that I can't respond to requests for bookings. I have spent hours on hold with a series of reps who haven't helped. One rep refused to believe my story and I had to send her screenshots of the problems on the site. After spending 20 minutes on hold each time I got cut off twice. Supervisor was supposed to call me back. He never did. They redact emails and phone numbers so you and potential guest can't contact each other directly. So far I have lost 2 bookings. And don't know what to do next.,1,"Lorna of Brookline, MA"
340,"Rented what was billed as a ""very nice condo on a golf course"". When I arrived it was actually a filthy trailer soaked in cigarette residue uninhabitable. The pictures used in the ad were not even the same property. The host persuades you to pay her directly on PayPal, then when you arrive offers a refund when you can't tolerate staying there. She never provides the refund & Airbnb won't help you because you've paid the host directly (at her urging of course). This is the listing, in Cathedral City CA: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4949043. Beware of this listing. Airbnb continues to provide listing for this fraud. In person she appears with her elderly mother & the 2 of them are extremely charming. The charm ends when you attempt the promised refund and the host begins hurling insults via text & email.",1,"George of Rio Nido, CA"

Property filthy in places especially kitchen- oven and fridge, bed at point of collapse, prescription drugs for owner in drawer in the kitchen accessible to anyone (we had children with us). Owner refusing 1 night's refund as we left without giving them notice or chance to rectify?! Would have taken them longer than the 2 nights we had booked to rectify! Airbnb NO help! In favor of owner! Absolutely disgusted with their total lack of care! Ripoff company! No wonder on Ripoff Britain this morning!",1,"Alison of Holme Hale. Norfolk, Other"
342,"I had what I thought was a confirmed reservation for Ken's condo in Bangkok. And, about one month out, I received an email that Ken had ""canceled"". I could not believe it. Host are able to cancel. And, while Airbnb claims the host is penalized... The renter receives NONE of that penalty (it goes to Airbnb). So, you are simply left out in the cold to find another condo. Well, I suppose I could just ""search"" for a different condo. But, what happens when that host cancels? And, Airbnb claims to put notification on the host's page that he/she has canceled. One week later there is still no notification for other potential renters on Ken's page. Simply, BEWARE.",1,"Ben of Goddard, KS"
343,"Guys be careful when you book on Airbnb next time. I made a booking No. **. I purchased air tickets and packed my bags for next days travel - only to hear that the host has cancelled my booking. And Airbnb does not take any responsibility to provide me alternative booking. Since it is the last minute - now they are demanding me to shell out 300% MORE so that I can get similar property. It is such a huge disappointment that I never expected from Airbnb. They charge you 20% booking fee, but when things don't go right, they just wash off their hands blaming the host. Come on, do we book with Airbnb because we know the host prior to booking?",1,"Ramesh of Taguig, Other"
344,"SHAME ON AIRBNB. SHAME ON AIRBNB. I tried very hard to get help less than 24 hours after I had booked a room and wanted to change due to lack of trust of the host. Airbnb made no effort to make things right for me. You have NO advocate with Airbnb if things go bad... I had until now booked with them with a false sense of security that their customer service would handle things fairly if needed, however my experience with Maria at Airbnb was proof that they put ill educated and poorly trained people in charge of handling (if you call it that!) issues.",1,"Ma of Calabasas, CA"
345,"I have been a host on Airbnb for over 3 years and submitted my first report because a guest booked with me for two nights and upon their departure it was discovered they set up a screen printing business in my home for the two days they stayed and damaged my sofa, linens, glass top of coffee table and bathtub. I followed Airbnb guidelines and contacted a representative at their Help number, which took all of my information and the specifics revolving around the incident and damages. The rep said she would email me a form that I needed to fill out to report such damages to my property. 24 hours later I called the Help number again because I had not received the form as promised and a new rep said there were no notes in their system of my incident report.

So we rated our trips with one and two stars with a note about its infestation of unwanted bed bugs. First response from Airbnb next day was: ""Reconsider your evaluation"". We did not do it- nothing to reconsider. Second day response from Airbnb: ""You are not in compliance with the rules therefore we cannot post your comments"". When we tried to response and include a photo of our bites we found out that we were blocked out from the system. Basically they want to hide any bad experience due to their future profits that are above all for them. So we cannot warn the future guests for this situation.",1,"Jerry of Chico, CA"

Just a terrible representation of a business.",1,"Forrest of Bloomington, MN"
348,Airbnb is getting extremely unreliable. A few months ago my husband booked a place in Paris. It was canceled. He rebooked a place again and that one was cancelled less than 2 weeks before he was leaving. A few months ago I thought I would give it a try again and booked a house in Barcelona for a very reasonable price. Dec 19th I get a notice that the booking was canceled.

After one night, we were forced to leave because the smell of natural gas and mildew permeated the apartment leaving us all feeling nauseous. We first addressed our concerns with the owner, who seemed to think we should just keep the main doors open (keep in mind, the doors faced a street with heavy traffic). We then addressed our concerns with Airbnb customer service and finally submitted a detailed review to notify other Airbnb users of our disturbing experience in hopes that the owner would rectify the situation for all future guests. This was one week ago. ",1,"Jayme of St Louis, MO"
350,I made the following complaint to Airbnb about a fraudulent listing of a two bedroom apartment and they denied my complaint... there is no standard as to what someone can list a room as a bedroom: BEWARE!!! I have one simple question: What standard does AIRBNB use when allowing owners of properties to define a room as a BEDROOM? Is it the IBC (International Building Code) The ICC (International Construction Code) The IRC (International Residential Code)? OR Do you just take the owners word for it without any defined standard?,1,"Robert of Camarillo, CA"
351,I want to love Airbnb. In 4 stays over 4 mos - average $100/night I found some very aggravating things hosts could easily fix. My suggestions: Check your cleaning service! 2 coffee pots were filthy - one impacted with moldy grounds - Clean often with white vinegar! 2 places had coffee pots - no filters. I'll bring coffee but the correct size filters provided by host would be nice. 1 had awesome espresso machine - that didnt work. Dust! Sneezed all night at a $100 guest house - in the AM I found the wall at the head of the bed was covered in dust! Under the bed same (Same place with moldy coffee pot).,1,"Susan of Gardnerville, NV"

I had to request a refund which can take up to 5 days to go back to my card. Luckily we have plenty of funds. However, what about people who can't afford to book another place without that money? This is a scam. Should not trust your card with these people. Hopefully the refund will show up and we don't have to go through a dispute process. I will not book with Airbnb again.",1,"Dusty of Joplin, MO"
354,I booked an Airbnb home from host S.F. Maple in Jupiter Fl. After full payment they canceled our reservation a week prior to our stay with no explanation.

357,"We were looking forward to a trip to the TN Smoky Mountains and thought renting a cabin would be a great way to ""get-away"" from the crowds. Well the picture of the cabin we chose was really cute and it looked so nice that I booked it for 3 days. When we got to the cabin it was NOT what it seemed on the Airbnb site and not what it was described as being. The cabin was only about 100 feet off a country road with 2 other cabins right in front of it. The people in the both of the front cabins looked like they owned their cabins and the front cabin had parking right up to the front of our cabin. There was no ""mountain views"" and the people in the front cabin made noise up to 10 pm. ",1,"KC of Cocoa, FL"
358,I was having a major issue verifying my payment option which lead to a delay in my reservation. I had no other options and hadn't heard back from the host. I spoke with James ** who remained on the line while navigated the system and waited for a response from the host. He then offered to contact host in a attempt to make sure I booked the location time and price I wanted. James ** went over and beyond and was literally a guardian angel and prevented me from being on the streets that night.

According to the rules on the website there was NO charge for extra people, $100 cleaning fee, and check out time was Monday at 11:00 am.

I had been traveling from Penn station to the apartment since it was relatively close by foot so I walked. I had been contacting the host all day but I had no answer. And I even messaged her the days before and nothing. I arrive to the location and still I have not received any information from the host as to what apartment number. This was my first experience with Airbnb in NYC and I am 18 years old in this city. I contacted Airbnb after two hours of no contact with the hostess. She had read my texts but no answers.

363,"I contacted the host to ensure I did not have a reservation within 24 hours of my inquiry. The reason why is the site said his place was inactive.

I responded and reminded him of our previous conversation only to be told no, I was wrong. I have a long string of emails to prove I am right.

The bathroom was pretty dirty. Fortunately, I was only staying there one night so I held my tongue and coped.

381,airbnb decided to not go ahead with charges this time,2,"Serge of Monteregie, QC"
382,I booked at house in February and needed to cancel in March for a stay in August. The refund policy is very misleading. Cancel within 48 hours of booking and 14 days before check in to get full refund. Cancel up to 7 days before check in and get a 50 percent refund minus service charge. Cancel within 7 days of your trip and the reservation is non refundable. The host tells you they think you get back the amount. Airbnb tell you different. Service charges taken. Out of $393.28 I’m getting back $8.22 cents. ,2,"Sally of Calgary, AB"
383,"I canceled a reservation 60 days prior to a house with Strict cancellation policy. Guess what, I still have to refund from the host for money. The host told me that my cancellation excuse is ""lame"", and she has the right to decide not to refund my money. How ridiculous? What is the point with a definition of Strict cancellation policy? On AirBnb web page, it sad that ""cancellation before 14 days will get full refund except service fee"". AirBnb is getting worse and worse each year. I won't use it again.",2,"Zoe of Davis, CA"
384,"My first and only experience was horrible. I booked a house and made a down payment in January for a trip in March. There was an issue with payment because of my account being hacked into. They canceled my reservation without informing me that they were doing so. When I realized this days before our trip, I called and received the worst customer service in my life, specifically from Raven. They claimed that they emailed me to let me know but I never received it. They said I did not verify my email and that’s why. How were they able to take almost $400 from me if I hadn’t verified my email? ",2,"Tabatha of Saint Petersburg, FL"
385,Whatever you do don't book Airbnb. They cancelled my trip the day before and said I was locked out for security issues out of the blue the day before. I wish I read the reviews first. I now not only have to find a place for myself but my whole crew.,2,"Joseph of Myrtle Beach, SC"
386,"My first experience with Airbnb was one of a bait and switch tactic. Instead of a hotel, I decided to stay in an apartment. The rate was $201 per night. During the booking process, the rate increased to $250 per night. Luckily, I double checked everything before submitting payment. I ended up booking the reservation through another well known website for the original price of $201 per night, plus I saved a little due to the booking fees being lower. Since, I've received multiple emails from Airbnb encouraging me to complete the booking even though it's no longer available. I'm very disappointed and don't understand why companies participate in such unethical practices.",2,"Dawn of Birmingham, AL"
387,"After months of struggling with Airbnb...I gave up and then easily booked my vacation at VRBO! No more shock and disappointment discovering the difference between Airbnb’s hosts’ posted and actual price of rentals! No more delayed, confusing communications from hosts’ reneging on pricing and rental availability! And perhaps best of all no more suffering through Airbnb’s so called customer reps insisting that hosts are too busy to post accurate information and renters just need to waste as much time as it takes trying to get accurate rental info or who arbitrarily cancel an Airbnb customer’s account because the customer objects to such a woefully lacking customer service model.

388,"This is my first time using Airbnb to book my vacation. Me and my sister two family of 8 people planning a 6 nights trips in Las Vegas for the spring break. I had made a reservation through Airbnb on December 28 2018, for apartment in downtown Las Vegas from April 13th to April 19th 2019. 5 days later, my sister told me, she doesn’t want to go on the road trip no more, cause there are too much driving for her. So I hurry up and canceled the reservation, but they said the cancellation policy is very strict, you may cancel the reservation within 48 hours and 14 days before check in to get a full refund. It is very tricky, I canceled my reservation 100 days before I check in but they still charged me 50 percent of my deposit which is $468.75. Cause I didn’t meet the “within 48 hours.“ ",2,"Syndia of San Leandro, CA"

Airbnb associate said that if there was no response in 1 hr. from 4:42pm, they would give us a full refund, the reservation would be cancelled, they would help us find another property and the host would lose their ""Super Host"" status.

390,"Airbnb.com says that you can cancel a booking and get full refund, or free of charge, if you cancel your booking before 48 hours, or within 48 hours of booking. Well, I am trying to cancel a 28 day booking I made in Budapest, but I am starting to get a really bad feeling about this host. I am afraid this host might be a scam, and I didn't want to risk getting to a faraway land in a country I’ve never been before, and risk not being able to get in the apartment with a child. I changed my mind and I was thinking to stay in another city instead, but since I paid $792.00 I wanted to get a refund so I could use it for another booking in another city. But airbnb.com website is telling me that my full refund (in less than 48 hours of booking) will be only $64.00. This company airbnb.com is a scam. Please be aware.",2,"Alexandra of Issaquah, WA"

392,"Their famous service does not equal to their customer support. Definitely the worst I've encounter yet!

394,Recently rented a place and the owner kept my deposit saying that we scratched his fridge door yet we are positive it was his cleaner. He charged us $300 for a scratch and AirBNB allowed him to do this even though he never repaired the scratch. He got a fake quote and they allowed it. I have only gotten great reviews and am always very careful. AirBNB refused to keep open communication with me and immediately charged my credit card.,2,"Rhonda of Honolulu, HI"
395,"I called in August regarding issues on my account not letting me book a place. I’ve called multiple times, and have not received a callback.

396,"I had booked a condo in the middle of June for a December vacation. My wife and I were already in Huatulco when the host cancelled on us two days prior to moving into the condo. Airbnb gave me a $92.00 credit to put towards another property. With only two days before we required a place to stay I booked another property which ended up being 6 times the original booking. I have read and re-read their policies on Host cancellations and have been going back and forth with Airbnb to get this resolved. I am going on three months now and they keep putting it to a different customer care department. I have copied all my correspondences with them and have shown them their own policies in regards to a Host cancellation. Just wish that they would come forward and say, ""Sorry we were wrong and here is your refund."" For a company that brags about its platform being built on trust they certainly don't follow through.",2,David of Other

It was also starting to give me a slight headache. I left and was there 3 hours. Immediately notified The Host. He gave me no resolution so I contacted Airbnb to request my refund and I did it within their 24 hour time frame as stated on the refund policy. It took them 11 days and they have denied my refund request and now they have blocked my ability to contact the host or them. They have not responded to me as far as supplying housing an alternate or my money back and I am not able to contact them. I paid $2,421.46 for 30 days. ",2,"Erin of San Jose, CA"

When I called customer service to complain and cancel, they initially agreed to refund me all of my money but when it came time for the refund they would only refund half the amount saying it was what was fair to both me and the host. They are refusing to honor their commitment on the refund. This was the first and definitely last time I will ever use Airbnb!",2,"Denise of Cumming, GA"

When we entered the property, there were no directions for check-in or check-out, or how to use the Wifi or cable TV. There was old, opened food in the refrigerator and cabinets, beer bottles in the cushion of the sofa, exposed wires on the smoke detectors, missing batteries, and missing units, as well as closet doors that wouldn't open, AND cracked/raised tile in a bedroom that was a tripping hazard.

I don't understand how they cancel my reservations hours before arrival then trick me into another reservation under false pretenses. Double cross me twice then expect me to trust them not to cancel on me again? Why? If I am too ** for your LA reservation I should be too ** for your Las Vegas reservation. I see some people still believe in slavery.,2,"Anthony of Dayton, OH"

Host (**) sent me a notice saying he misunderstood what 'instant booking' meant and that the booking was too short notice so he couldn't do it. I'm only giving it an extra star because of the nice customer service handling the problem and refunding my money, otherwise I'd give it one star. I don't think I will use this service again.

So while I have this reserved, there were some things I had to change about the profile since it was a company profile under a former employee's name. While doing so our reservation was canceled and we were only offered a partial refund. I contacted the host about refunding the rest and he offered me a bogus special that was for $199 per night. Well, the original price was for about $150 per night. He also told me that he contacted Airbnb and they informed him that it was an error that caused the cancellation.

I have confirmed with letter from the bank that account is closed, and that there is no chargeback request for the charge, at which point I was directed to provide a new card for refund process. Two weeks later still waiting on refund. Managers are unwilling to reassign issue stating that only the person handling this matter can handle moving forward, but that person is continually out of office. What recourse does one have? I have never used this service before and I sure I never will in the future.",2,"Kimberly of Atlanta, GA"
413,I rented a cabin at Broken Bow that said free refund within their guidelines. Due to personal reasons I had to cancel within a reasonable time frame.

A week later, I received an email saying my account was permanently closed and that they did not need to tell me why.

So not only is the $400 dollar gift card stuck (we can't sell it or get rid of it) we have to use on another trip using AIRBNB which will be the very last time we use them. Our mistake is we should have read reviews of this organization prior to using. VBRO is much better, used them a couple of time with great success.

416,"Last summer 2018 I had an Airbnb guest for over two months at my apartment. Knowing it was going to be a long stay, I called Airbnb prior, to let them know I was concerned about the utilities being included in the price. Utilities are paid per use and it is hard to anticipate what the guest will be using, mainly in summer with AC units. Airbnb told me not to worry because I would be covered by their standard agreement. After the guest had left, I received the electrical bill and it was 3 times more than what I had anticipated. I brought it up to Airbnb and the only thing they had to say was they are sorry but the security deposit can not be applied to utilities. Utilities are always included in the price. How are we supposed to estimate the electrical use for extended stays? It does not feel fair to estimate a really high number and make some people overpay.",2,"Yolanda of New York, NY"

I then reached out to the host to get assistance and get the police involved, this instead was the beginning of the nightmare.

When I arrived after a 13 hour flight from overseas I called the host to inform him of my arrival date and time in Albuquerque and get directions for picking up the key. He acted like he wasn't even aware of my reservation. After a bit of conversation he remembered and then he told me he was sorry it was already rented out.

Today, when I went to make another reservation, I was told by Airbnb that the $3,500 in credits were actually two individual coupons, one for $1,500 and another for $2,000 -- and that each could only be applied once.

423,The matter first began when Airbnb froze payment on my account. I opened a simple ticket to inquire why. First Airbnb said I had to fill out a US tax account form. This was false as I am in Canada. I spent time and money trying to resolve the matter based on this false advice. Next Airbnb said I needed to become a business and provide my business details. Again I investigated. This was also false. Lastly it was a simple matter unrelated to what Airbnb support told me. I then asked to escalate this horrible matter when I was given blatantly false information and to be given a chance to provide feedback on the specific conversation.,2,Ben of Canada

I notified Airbnb that the host is not allowed to rent out her apartment in this complex and that I want a refund. Airbnb refused to refund ANY of our payment.

They made many accusations and told many lies in this review. I asked Airbnb to take it down since it was clear that they were was seeking justice for losing their deposit. Airbnb refused to take the review down. That being said, it greatly impacted my business.

In an attempt to conceal the damages, the guest wrapped the soiled sheets in clean towels, turned the pillow cases inside out, and ""made the bed"" with the soiled duvet. Upon check out, the house rules convey guests need to report any damages (not once has a guest stepped up for obvious damage) among other things that need to be tended to, like locking up. Guest did not lock the door and so I had to send someone over to lock up. Had the guest revealed what had happened, steps of sanitation would have been implemented.",2,"James of San Diego, CA"
438,"My wife and I rented an Airbnb in Stavanger, Norway. The place literally made us both ill. There were rats, mold in the walls, mold in the wooden floor, furniture destroyed, appliances broken, no vacuum cleaner, bathroom illegally installed so rats had direct access to the unit, no lock on the entrance door. When we made Airbnb aware of the place we told them that we had both developed respiratory problems and headaches their reply was that this is not sufficient for a refund!!!",2,Michael of Norway
439,"I had a situation where I rented a house under specific ""house Rules"" and ""Security Deposit Amt."" The agreement was made ~2 months prior to rental. ~2.5 weeks prior to our rental date the owner changed the ""house rules,"" notifying us that there would be surveillance cameras inside the house and the security deposit was changed from $2000 to $3000. I had full documentation of the original terms of the rental agreement as well as the changes made. AirBNB customer service reps (located outside of the U.S.) neither understood Airbnb's own policies nor did they care about the violation of the renter. I tried speaking with reps from within the U.S. The company is extremely chaotic. Could never speak with same reps twice. It was a nightmare. I lost $1260.00. I WILL NEVER USE AIRBNB'S SERVICE AGAIN SO LONG AS I RESIDE ON THIS EARTH SO HELP ME GOD! They are a sham!",2,"Patrick of Sayville, NY"
440,"I’ve been hosting using Airbnb the last couple months and find the app and company policies to be quite unfair for us hosts. For example, anytime someone has an inquiry/question you as a host must pre-approve them staying with you in order to avoid penalties. I have had several guests ask to park at my place for up to 3 weeks while they travel & only book 1 night at my place. ",2,"M of City,City"
441,"Fist of all Airbnb did not follow their company refund policy to issue my refund. Second of all, the case manager erased all the communication record between me and her in my personal profile of Airbnb!!!! Third of all, Airbnb case manager refuse to post my review to the host SPI Rental South Padre Island which steals $1556.17 from me without providing a safe environment and created lots of issues which qualified for the refund to customers based on Airbnb refund policy. I spent two horrible night there and was charged for $1556.17. Airbnb helps those treating and disgusting host to fool customers to rent from Airbnb. Airbnb prevented a customer to review the terrible host and just put the good review for the terrible to help them fool people and make their commission fee!!!",2,"Emily of Pearland, TX"
442,"We rented a condo a month ahead of time. When we arrived, the lockbox code did not work. We called the host... Long voicemail saying he was out of town... Voice mailbox was full. Left text for host... no response after an hour. Called Airbnb... was on hold for 50 minutes. Agent said he would try to call host. Agent called back in 15 minutes saying that the host had finally answered but had then hung up on the agent! The agent canceled our reservation on the spot and said the host has the right to cancel at any time!! This is not the first time an Airbnb host has canceled at the last minute. I find that VRBO and HomeAway are much more professional and reliable and will continue to use them in the future.",2,"Jill of Greenville, SC"
443,"I am saddened to share my terrible experience with the Airbnb hosts. I have never ever in my entire life of traveling experience such terrible people. I made a booking from AIRBNB and their system allowed me to book, pay and everything. My greatest unpleasant surprise was to find out that the first host has no house available for me and my family,",2,"akhona of Other, OTHER"
444,So Airbnb likes to ** with people too much. I normally don’t care to write reviews but I’ve had too much trouble with Airbnb and I just want everyone to know that they are the worst company. Let me tell you how. Bear with me because this is a long issue I’m about to complain about. In 2017 around June or July a friend and I took a trip to California. On the way to California about 2 hours out our Airbnb was cancelled. We felt with Airbnb for a long time and had a huge issue with customer service so we were told we would receive a credit for our next stay. Now this is a whole issue I’m not about to get into because it has nothing to do with this current issue but I want you to know before I took my trip on 11/14/2018 I called Airbnb since I never received credit from my trip in 2017. I called and they gave me 100$ credit FOR MY TROUBLES in 2017. Keep that in mind.,2,"Naturally of Scottsdale, AZ"
445,"We recently rented an apartment in Barcelona Spain, and the experience wasn't good at all, neither the support from Airbnb. The apartment was dirty, no sheets, no towels and the AC did not work. It is really frustrated and unfortunate for most customers as I went through the reviews here. Airbnb seems to care only about the money from the host and they take the side of the host, no matter what they say, I realize that they can say anything, and that is really troubling, not fair and not right at all, and gives you with a bad taste and awful experience that makes you question choosing Airbnb again.",2,"Belinda of Oviedo, FL"
446,"Airbnb warning. Just a warning that not all hosts are honest. I recently booked a home in Isla Mujeres in Mexico for the month of February and luckily enough was in Mexico in December and took a day out of my vacation to check out the rental. We hired a local cab driver to help us find the property. We not only never found the house but the street it was supposed to be on was in a slum and garbage lined the streets, bars on all the windows, nothing even close to the picture on the Airbnb listing. ",2,Antje of Canada
447,"If you are looking for renting a property through this booking site please read carefully and be aware. Hidden fees - The prices listed seem to be lower compared to some hotels, but that is misleading. Once you get to the check out you all of sudden notice that 1. They charge you booking fee for every day you book - that seems to be % of your booking so it can add up to $80-$100 extra. 2. Many hosts will charge you cleaning fee $30-$35. 3. Many hosts will want you to also pay for electricity and water. 4. Add to that you get no daily service. 5. No free breakfast. 6. No airport shuttle. 7. No 24 hrs front desk service since the host lives usually quite far or in different country. All added up you pay a lot more for the booking than in the hotel.",2,"Michael of Columbia, SC"
448,I have used AirBnB quite often and never had a complaint. This time the apartment we rented was not owned or rented by the host who listed it on the site. Someone else was occupying it. Seems it was a fraud case. While I had no issues with the AirBnB agent who was forthcoming and supportive it took us nearly two hours to get someone on the phone or chat. All three travelers were trying to contact AirBnB by phone and chat. Every time the system or someone (?) hung up after 40 to 60 minutes of listening to that awful music. Basically if you have a problem you are on your own. After nearly two hours we finally got someone on the line who authorized us to take a hotel which would be reimbursed. I hope that works.,2,"Udo of Denver, CO"
449,"I recently stayed at a room in a private home, with a shared bathroom and the experience wasn't good at all, neither the support from Airbnb, and it is really frustrated and unfortunate for most customers as I went through the reviews here.

450,"The experience overall was good as a host, But I do have an issue with not being informed/alerted that I had to provide an identity to withdraw the money! It's basically hidden info on the site while it should be very clear to me before I proceed to have a guest in my house. It's been a few months and the guest is gone and I still can't receive my money (That I started the whole thing because I was in need of it at that time), I can't do that because I don't own a passport and that's the only option they gave me to prove my identity so they made it even harder for me! That's an issue or that's what I think is an issue.",2,"Moustafa of Other, OTHER"

452,"An Airbnb host cancels unexpected two days prior to the check-in date for a family New Year's celebration. When ""working"" for over four hours with the Airbnb Customer Service, all of whom are shocked that the limited comps are so expensive so close to a major holiday. Airbnb provided poor alternatives for a family trip, stating that other options were too expensive. Their solution was to receive a partial reimbursement after the fact. Not to mention this was after four LONG phone calls and four hours of nothingness. I expected more. My fault for assuming anything good from Airbnb.",2,"Sean of Saint Louis, MO"
453,"I stayed in an Airbnb in this Nov 2018 for 16 days in a house in Canada, Toronto, Pintail Cres. The host entered my room without permission 3 times, or more. The host's wife, Olxa, informed me at night that the host Darxn was in my room to unplug my MP3 Player. There is no advanced notification for permission to enter my room. On the second last day of my stay, when I came back at night, I found a gift paper wrapped cookie on my desk. Nobody asked for permission to enter the room or notified me after the entering up to this Dec 22, 2018. My concern is that that day I was rushed out for training and forgot to lock my luggage which has my passport, ID cards, credit cards etc important personal info.",2,"Candie of San Jose, CA"
454,"I have been using Airbnb since 2016. Every time I encountered a problem, Airbnb takes the side of the host irrespective of the circumstances. They also hide or delete bad reviews at the request by the host. My recent experience was, I arrived at this house to find out the place is dirty and had cutlery with food particles on them. The floor infested with ants and there were a few flies, those large ones that appear during summer, in the house. The house was facing the host's backyard and the place was a mess. Due to these shortcomings I immediately notified Airbnb after attempting to contact the host. The Airbnb contacted the host. When the host arrived at the property, they were visibly upset and appeared aggressive. They tried to pick an argument which I tried hard to avoid, which made me really uncomfortable and felt threatened at the time. I was alone at their property and anything could happen when someone is upset.",2,Upul of Australia
455,They advertise that you can get a refund within 14 days before check-in. Please read the fine print because they don't. They have you pay for half the duration e.g 5 days if you will stay for 10 days. If you cancel after 38 hours but within the 14 days you get nothing back and they still advertise for the days you have paid for that you didn't get a refund. Talk about double payment.,2,Fibi of Other
456,"We have a trip planned in a week and just received a text cancelling our rental. They offer to refund our money, but getting something in a strange place with one week's notice is not easy. Not only are places more expensive with such short notice, we cannot get a great place for our vacation and have to settle for whatever we can get. Such a disappointment. How is this acceptable when we rented the place two months ago. No apology or explanation. I WILL NEVER TRUST THIS SERVICE AGAIN.",2,"Deborah of Reno, NV"
457,"We had booked a cabin for 12/28/2018-12/30/2018. Just two weeks before our trip, the host calls that the cabin isn’t available anymore due to the owners selling it, and not giving a 60 day notice. Just two weeks before my family arrives from Florida expecting a cabin, and in the busiest day of the year. There were no other selections in our price range so we don’t get any other cabin for that date due to the others being more expensive. Instead we get a measly credit of $101 for another booking, yet there are none left. This ruined our trip, especially since my family has been going through a hard time lately, and me and my wife wanted to treat them to a relaxing getaway. ",2,"M. of Dayton, TN"
458,I was visiting Lima Peru and booked a 1 bedroom apartment through Airbnb. (I have used my account with Airbnb in the past without any issue.) Upon arrival I was handed the keys from the landlord. She immediately explained the apartment wasn’t ready at the moment which was fine because I wasn’t going to be returning until The evening So I took the keys and left. I returned around 7 pm with my belongings and noticed the apartment was dirty particularly the bathroom since it clearly showed signs that it hadn’t been cleaned. There was a half used soap in the soap holder of the shower and a very dirty white rug to put your feet on after a shower. There was also no hand soap at all by the sink and there was one hand towel that was moist as if it had already been used. ,2,"Sandra of Hallandale, FL"
459,The assigned case manager hasn't contacted me for almost 24 hours on a time sensitive issue! They only care about making money and they usually side with the host.

460,MY AIRBNB ACCOUNT WAS DISABLED FOR NO VALID REASON!!! I was a regular Airbnb user for years until they put my account under review. I've been waiting since about December 2016 for a response on why my account was disabled. I've emailed & called them several times over the wait. They just sent a response December 2018. (TWO YEARS LATER!) Companies love throwing their 'terms of service' at you & telling you what they're not liable for when they are being **. Simply to remind you that they don't care about your frustrations & they are not there for you. ** AIRBNB!,2,"Ian of Brooklyn, NY"

When we reached the apartment and could not get in and after we tried getting in touch with the host without any success, we contacted Airbnb.

462,"My husband booked an apartment on 8 Ave Macmahon near Arc de Triomphe. We are traveling with our 2 kids. On 8th December after the Paris violent protests, we asked for a cancellation and requested to change our booking to a safer location on 29 Dec. The roads to Ave Macmahon were blocked and metros around there were closed on 8 Dec. Tear gas and water cannons were fired right outside this apartment! After 3 days of email and multiple phone calls Airbnb has denied us a change even though we highlighted that it was unsafe especially for the kids. On their Airbnb website they have listed violence, inaccessibility and safety hazard as conditions for refund. Shouldn't they honor it? Their reply is, ""The host has refused a refund!""",2,Lim of Singapore
463,"They're a worst. I booked a trip like 5 days ahead. I wanted to cancel it the next day, which is still within 48 hour, since my schedule changed. They won't give me full refund, only 50% of it; they said the cancellation has to be within 48 hours AND 14 days ahead. How stupid is that? How can I have 14 days notice if I just book a room for a trip next week? They told me to go talk to the host as they can't do anything. I wish they're out of business soon. Heard they said they would go public, pray lord. The most irresponsible business model in the world. Use Booking.com instead. They help you cancel full refund even though it's not stated when you booked.",2,"Merry of Sugar Land, TX"
464,"My experience with Airbnb had been ok for approx 2 1/2 years until I had a bad renter which resulted in over $3,000 worth of damages to my home.

Capital One is trying to stick me with the full amount, even though Airbnb allows the host to not only insult guests that have stayed at her house, but also scam people with her rental, as there are numerous reviews stating that the host has roaches in her rental property. The fact that Airbnb allows this is beyond ridiculous, and Airbnb doesn't take care of its customers. They're in it for the host to rent locations to guests, sight unseen, fake pictures, fake reviews, unsafe locations, and unsanitary situations. Don't waste your money. Get a hotel room, you'll be way better off.",2,"Kristy of Burbank, IL"
466,"I raised a complaint to the Airbnb customer support team regarding a discriminatory review that I faced with my host. The latter made rude comments about me and gave me a bad public review.

467,"Frankly, I only knew Airbnb from my bookings, and I never had any experience with Airbnb Resolution team until their online agent, Ronie's, recently helped me very quickly and to my satisfaction, and that impressed me, but today another agent, Alexandre, truly ""knocked off my socks"" with instant and tremendously caring quality customer care on a different issue. I can't overestimate that! Now I know that Airbnb is much more than just a place to stay but also a place filled with wonderful and caring people. First-rate service!",2,"David of Indian Creek, IL"

I contacted Airbnb and they told me they were false reviews and I had nothing to worry about. They assured me that if I saw any when I checked in that they would move us. We checked in and we started seeing them everywhere!!! I contacted them and not only did they not move us but they only refunded $120 of the $950 we paid! We had to spend the trip in a cockroach infested place. I called, asked to speak to a manager and they did not care. They closed the case and told me it was my choice to stay there. I have used Airbnb for years and I cannot believe how they treated this situation.",2,"Sarah of Martinez, CA"
469,I booked a condo for a week in the Philippines and when we arrived to the condo it smelled like mold. The smell was really bad. I left immediately. Could not stay in an apartment that smelled so bad. I contacted Airbnb and asked for a refund. They were on the side of the host and only refunded me half. They did not protect me and were more on the side of the host. I posted a bad review about the host and it was never posted. There was no bad language used just being honest about my experience and it was not posted. No wonder the host has so many good reviews and no negative. I will not trust Airbnb anymore. It's a gamble. Imagine traveling far away and when you get there it's not what you expected. Who has your back because Airbnb won't.,2,"Hector of Union City, NJ"

They declined to protect the host saying guest are free to say what they please so long as they aren't racist. I then explained I was not going to offer the guest money and instead provided Airbnb the plumber's note confirming the radiators were working and the house was above average hot, on top of which the guest had left windows open.

Just today, I wrote a bad review on Airbnb for an awful host and it was removed within the hour. I didn't break the guidelines, they didn't give me a valid reason for removing my review. I just guess that only good reviews sell. That is why I chose that host in the first place (all good reviews)… But if Airbnb removes the bad reviews, you have no way to know. I stopped using Airbnb because Airbnb is nothing without the honest reviews.",2,"Michael of Lebanon, Other"

My brother tried to take a stroll during daylight in opposite directions over 2 days.

They did not want to reimburse us and they will not that the listing off, so beware when you plan your next vacation. They also edited your review and only post positive reviews.

475,"The place I rented did not have the amenities it promised (heated pool) and was dirty. Also the host showed up in our backyard in the dark with a flashlight unannounced during our stay and it made us feel extremely unsafe. So, there is the component of having a host that is dodgy. But the component that compelled me to write this review is the way Airbnb handled my concern. They sided with the host based on his rating overall rather than my individual experience. My experience was uniquely bad but because his reviews were ok from other guests my concern were not addressed and was minimized. There is no direct number to contact Airbnb and so all complaints are logged in an e-mail process. They called me back and that's when I got their number.

Most of the time the electricity in the common areas is blacked out making it impossible to see where you're going and also impossible to know if you are being followed.

While I understand I have a record from when I was young and dumb but if this keeps me from getting a place shouldn't it be looked into before you take my money and give me codes for the house?

492,"Broken alarm system, smoke detectors missing, patchwork of leaks in ceiling unpainted, broken fridge, broken garage door, black grit in sink when water runs, balcony doors locked unable to sit out, filthy, old foods left in pantry. Sad experience for what we paid. Pictures available. Airbnb did not address my issues.",2,"Karan of Fort Worth, TX"
493,"I was looking to book a condo using Airbnb. This was my first time using their service. I wanted to make sure there were no other fees aside from the total shown during booking so I called the customer service number. I was reassured that there were no other fees to be collected as this was against Airbnb policy. I asked because I saw a mention of taxes were to be collected. I asked the same question and was given the same answer. This was around 11pm at night. The following day, the property manager called me about the taxes due. I called customer service and I was told I was to pay the taxes since it's listed on the website. Well, that's why I called prior to booking. ",2,"C of Houston, TX"
494,"with no excuse or reason why I have no payments like many others. They just tell me they are working on the problem, firstly they told me it was the Australian banking system so I call my bank and was told it was Airbnb changing their system with world pay. They just don’t seem to care.",2,Karleine of Australia
495,"Renters beware. Booking an Airbnb with Nina, Marais district, Paris France, was my first experience at booking an Airbnb, and consequently will be my only experience, booking anything through Airbnb. My trip was schedule and then Hurricane Irma hit (the largest hurricane to hit the state of Florida in history). Nina told me to reschedule but I had to contact her off Airbnb. (I later learned this was so she could still collect my payment and Airbnb would still get their kickback). She let me reschedule and then on the day I was supposed to fly out, she told me she double booked and that I would have to stay at a different location, for which she refused to disclose details.",2,"Sarah of Vero Beach, FL"
496,Beware booking with Airbnb far in advance of your trip. I just booked an apartment in Malta for a month in March and they charged me the full amount on Nov 7th rather than a deposit and the balance in February. When I phoned Customer Service there is of course nothing they can do. Just be careful when booking - make sure you are pre-approved for the rental then you will have the option of 2 payments.,2,Fred of Canada
497,"We booked a condo in Angel Fire, NM for 7 days over Christmas at a listed price of $168 per night. After our 50% deposit was accepted and our reservation confirmed the “Hosts” called me separately, emailed me and sent me a private message over Airbnb that they had accidentally posted the incorrect price and if we did not accept their “altered” price of $535 a night then they would cancel our reservation. Knowing they legally can’t make us pay for their mistake, the wife called me begging that we please cancel or they would not be able to make their mortgage. ",2,"Jennifer of Grand Prairie, TX"
498,"I and my wife rented a house in Lake Havasu for two weeks at a price of about $4,000.00. We were so eaten by bed bugs. We reported this to the owner and to Airbnb. We were told to take pictures to prove the bedbug. We took several pictures and sent them to the owner and Airbnb. We were told that the owner had supposedly taken care of the problem but my wife and my grandkids were bitten all over by the bed bugs. We were told that we should have reported it as soon as we got bit. We waited a couple of days to make sure what they were. We were offered a whole 10% off the rental rate. We will have bills for fixing our house and the houses of our children and their kids. I will never use this service again due to way we were treated. I highly encourage everyone not to use this service-ever!",2,"Dennis of Wilsonville, OR"
499,"I am and have been a Super Host with a Five star rating with Airbnb for over four years, I recently had a guest who came into my sparkling clean home and clog my toilet with his waste, he admitted to clogging the toilet and watching it drain onto the bathroom floor, and then he left my home for the day with no communication about the incident to me. When I came home later that day it was raining in my garage, the bathroom is right above the garage. He caused a lot of damage to my home and had the nerve to leave me a bad review. I contacted Airbnb support about the damage and the review, they put a case manager on my claim and his dishonest review, they will not support me as a host or remove the review.

500,"Not worth the bother or the money. I stayed in Copenhagen and was not at all satisfied with my room. I stayed in a basement where I couldn't lock the front door. The owner was not helpful at all, actually he was slightly hostile. And of course I didn't get some of the money back that I have paid. When I came home I was going to write a scathing review of this place but oh no. I had two weeks to do it they said, but after a few days it was too late. I contacted Airbnb about the review/deadline but that was like talking to a wall. It's extremely hard to get any response and when they finally answer they are of no help at all. Stay at a decent hotel or don't go at all is my suggestion.",2,Fred of Sweden
501,"I booked an apartment in Vancouver Canada through Airbnb and host charged me for the stay and also accept my reservation. I will get a notification from Host two days after that he wants to increase the price for 80% and I complain to Airbnb customer support about it (how would you let the host do this much increase after confirming my reservation). After a week, Airbnb did no do ANYTHING for me regarding this issue and they just cancel my reservation without any support. They let the host do whatever they want to the customers and they do not give any support to their customers. They even do not have any review system in their website after they cancel your reservation. Please share this with others so they know how Airbnb is acting in regard of customer service.",2,"Hesam of San Mateo, CA"
502,"I complained to Airbnb about cockroaches in my Toquerville, Utah, rental. The owner didn’t take accountability and Airbnb sides with her. They said they would only give me 1/2 of my money back, which I still have yet to see, because the roach photos I sent “didn’t prove an infestation."" What??? I didn’t realize a few cockroaches are a-ok when hosting tenants! (There were more than a few, but my pictures showed only several at once.)  Airbnb should be consumer-based, rather than siding with their hosts so much, judging by the other reviews. I’ll happily stay in hotels henceforth, as I KNOW a hotel would go above and beyond to make reparations for something as disgusting as this.",2,"Jessica of Clifton Park, NY"
503,"My friends booked an overnight stay in Brooklyn. I’ve never used Airbnb before. My friends, who are **, found this place in Brooklyn that was convenient and priced right. The owner was well rated, so there were no issues. I called him a week before the booking, to check on parking. We had two cars. I was concerned about on street parking. I asked if there was a lot nearby. He assured me that the neighborhood was safe and that we could get both our cars in his driveway. Ok, cool.",2,"Kim of Youngstown, OH"
504,So I moved provinces in Canada and before my son and I could settle down we booked into a *5 Star superhost* apartment in Toronto for 31 days. The pics were of a different apartment. The place was filthy dirty. The stove almost burnt us and the microwave was broken. The owner was out of the country and realized that he was renting the place and then *renting as an Airbnb* when he was away or staying at his girlfriend's. The owner of the place I mean my host's landlord one time stopped me and asked me what I was doing in his building. I explained to him and he almost kicked me out and I had already paid 1600$.,2,Jeri of Canada
505,"First and last time we use AIRBNB. The AC unit did not work in the apt, the beds had no linen, we received a nasty towel and the pillows had yellow stains all over and no pillow cases. We contacted the host and waited 24+ hours for an answer. We also contacted Airbnb, they were useless. The case manager was rude and did not offer any help other than to file a complain and to email pictures. We requested a refund and she denied our request. They took the word of the host over ours. Never again. STAY AWAY.",2,"Belinda of Oviedo, FL"
506,"Beware of Airbnb! We showed up to our “quaint” Victorian guest room in L.A.... 5 star ratings, great pics, and Airbnb “super host” do not mean much. Owner had us go through 3 security locks to get INTO the house only to find the back door wide open. Owners also did an oops and left the door to their hoarder room open, and then didn’t even have our room ready. I couldn’t get out quick enough and went to battle with Airbnb. They were difficult and wanted to charge 1/2 due to us “cancelling”. I insisted on sending pics to justify why we should get full refund. If I hadn’t taken pics, I’m sure I would have had to pay. After jumping through hoops, we got full refund.",2,"Lisa of Gilbert, AZ"
507,"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE! I used Airbnb for multiple years, multiple travel accommodations, I did not travel for 1 1/2 years, and stopped using Airbnb, I am now attempting to proceed with a booking and it's been 9 days since the initial booking request... With the same error message EVERY SINGLE time ""Oops, we're unable to complete this booking. Unable to perform action. Please try again through the website or contact support if you need immediate assistance."" I have called customer service EVERY SINGLE day, and NO ONE is documenting the issue, NO ONE is escalating the issue, NO ONE is telling me what the issue even is and why I can't even complete this booking. Multiple days and multiple hours on the phone with customer service, WASTED TIME and 9 days later, nothing is solved. TERRIBLE BUSINESS, TERRIBLE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH AIRBNB, go to VRBO or another reputable site.",2,"M of Santa Monica, CA"
508,"I booked a room knowing my travel situation could change, but the ad said full refund if cancellation prior to 24 hours before trip. I cancelled a month before the trip, and they kept $40 as a service fee. Nowhere was that made clear before I booked the room. Second time I had trouble with Airbnb; next time I'll use a real hotel and save myself the frustration.",2,"Jillian of Reading, PA"
509,"I rented an apartment at **, On arrival I noticed 2 signs. One on the clothes dryer that said broken do not use and one on the dishwasher that said the same. Not a good start. I started to look around the apartment and had to take photos. 1. Carpet was filthy and stained. 2. Cooktop was absolutely filthy and not properly cleaned. 3. Griller door was broken and full of grease. 4. Countertops in kitchen were stained. 5. Walls were filthy, chipped and i=unclean. 6. Shower was absolutely filthy. Grouting had not been cleaned for months and was filthy.",2,"Ray of Australia, Other"
510,"The additional fees are a rip-off. In the end the total costs work out more expensive than staying at a good reliable hotel in more central location. Got charged $99 service fees and $60 cleaning fees on top of $600 accommodation fee for 4 nights stay in a small apartment in Shinjuku. When I found a good 3 star hotel with breakfast included at a more Tokyo central location, which is also part of Qantas travel program, I attempted cancelling the Airbnb reservation, only to find out that you could only do this on a computer not on your phone or iPad, and that the service fee is not refundable because it was already more than 48 hours when I made the booking. I felt extremely frustrated because it said nowhere when I made the booking that the service fee is non-refundable after 48 hours. Literally a ripoff and a scam. On a note bookings through Agoda or Booking.com are free, if hotels have free cancellation policies you get all your money back.",2,"Hannah of Cranbourne North, Other"
511,"I rented with my wife a "" luxury apartment "" off 5th Avenue, pay USD 850 per night for 9 nights. We checked in at 3 pm, and first thing we noticed was that the rug in the living room was seriously disgusting, red wine was spilled all over it, and it had cigarette burns. But really the worst was when we went to bed. After some minutes we realized the smell, and then it dawned on us that we were sleeping in very used sheets/bed covers/pillow cases. The next day we reported it to the owner, by Whatsapp, and he came and removed the rug, and attempted to change the linen, but he is a young lawyer, and had never changed a bed in his lifetime, so my wife ended up doing it.",2,christian of Argentina

I have screen prints that prove the discount did not exist and contacted Airbnb and let them know. One of their caseworkers admitted that there was a bug in the system and he reported to be fixed. I have a print screen of that conversation as well. I stopped hearing from him and the next person told me there was no bug and he misspoke and has been reprimanded. Even Though I had screen prints they are telling me I agreed to a discount. I am taking them to court and am very sure I will win.",2,"Jackie of Granite Bay, CA"
513,"This company is the brand of highways robbers using and abusing people’s need in place to stay rung fully advertising about a place. The hosts are not that far behind with edited photos of their ** place called apartment, Airbnb is not a company but Rather bunch of drunken people with a junky’s appetite for people's money, these people simply should be out of Business not other way around, they don’t create anything but getting paid by hosts with the same distribution of junk than those who tuning the Airbnb.",2,"Bijan of Santa Monica, CA"
514,"Checked into an Airbnb in Lawndale, CA for 2 weeks. Immediately noticed the bathroom needed a thorough cleansing. No bowls in the cabinets, microwave filthy, etc. When I confronted the host I was told he had fired the maid and would be cleaning himself. No cleaning occurred despite the fact this was a shared bathroom and guests came and went. On a Sunday night, host had a party until 4 a.m. in which all the Airbnb guests stood in the hallway asking him to turn the music down. I moved out 1 week early and requested a full refund of unused days and supplied pictures of my issues. I was told by Airbnb that they would not be refunding me since I made the decision to leave on my own accord! I will never stay at an Airbnb again and am extremely disappointed with their customer service.",2,"Brenda of Dallas, TX"
515,Rented a Condo in Santa Rosa beach for 1 week. When we arrived there was a Red Tide condition that was present for a least 1 week without notification to us. Dead fish on the beach and unable to breathe on the beach. 2 days into the visit a mandatory evacuation was declared for our area. Airbnb and the owner refused any reimbursement. There are better companies out there to use - I would suggest doing so...,2,"Craig of Murfreesboro, TN"
516,"Airbnb pro host - No refunds whatsoever - no dispute resolution!!! Where do I begin - If I could leave no stars I would. Let's start with, we made the reservation at around 5pm. We told the host we would not be arriving until around midnight. He said no problem, just call when we got there and he would provide us a code to get in the door. When we arrived in Jersey City at midnight, I called Jason (the host) and got no answer. The neighborhood seems very sketchy. I had to call 5 or 6 times before he answered and gave us a code. We got into the place and it was about 95 degrees maybe more. There was no A/c in the apartment as described in the ad. There was 2 towels for 2 guys who were staying for 4 nights. There were no bowls, no plates and all these were mentioned in the amenities along with a coffee pot which did not exist.",2,"Glen of Andover, NY"
517,"When things go wrong, don’t count on Airbnb customer service to help. They don’t flex on their policies and have no consideration for your safety. Our host canceled our reservation 1 hour prior to check-in to our NYC apartment rental. I was stranded in NYC with my 2 small children, on a Friday evening of a holiday weekend, with no place to stay, and no means of support other than my phone (with limited battery life). Airbnb said it would be “really expensive” to try to rebook through them so balancing safety, timing, and finances, I opted to book a hotel room to ensure we had a place to sleep.",2,"Janna of Longmeadow, MA"

519,"We had a deceitful host, my rental advisor, advertise a private home on Airbnb. We booked and on the day of check in we found the place to be unsuitable to stay with a foul smell and mold all over the home. We then found out the home was fumigated with poisons for rats, cockroaches and termites. The host wouldn't get refund us so we went to Airbnb to resolve our issue. We wrote to Airbnb and asked for their help to resolve our issue. They reached out to the host who refused to refund us even though we did not and could not stay in the home with the poisons. ",2,Jeanette of Hong Kong
520,"We reserved an Airbnb in Washington DC about 10 months before trip. While travelling, Airbnb cancelled our booking about 1 week prior to that visit... Reason? Because the house owner was not complying, with their rules... They were warned 3 times... Did not comply so were taken off the site. Instead of penalizing the apartment themselves they actually penalised us more as we are stuck with nowhere to stay. The American office then emailed us to give us other choices of accommodation then booked it for us. We are Canadian so unknowingly they booked it in US dollars without telling us. That was a natural mistake as the agent didn't even think of that. But for us it meant another 30% increase. Their office would not do anything, even was going to penalise us for cancelling. We will never use their service again.",2,"Stan of Kelowna, Canada"
521,"I have to say I have never in my life been so offended. I have yet to even rent through Airbnb and I recently went on to search for something and my account was locked. I tried to get it to unlock and they asked for my ID photo. I sent it and then I got this horrible letter and now they won't respond back. How is it possible that they can block me when I have never even rented? I am not a criminal, nor have I ever been arrested or have even a parking ticket. I have a high powered career, am educated and have a family. ",2,"Sherri of Orange, CA"
522,"Terrible customer service. They say they'll call you back, but when they do, you'll still may wait on hold for 15+ minutes. Eventually, you'll get connected to a useless idiot in India who speaks in a fake American accent, has a fake American name, and doesn't listen to anything you say. They have a very poor interface with your local government, and when something goes wrong will not warn you in advance. Instead, they'll just cancel all your upcoming visitors. That'll BE your notice that something has gone wrong. You'll have to email your local government to find out what the actual problem is, because Airbnb's tech isn't good enough to determine the problem and convey it to you. ",2,"Joel of San Francisco, CA"
523,"I cancelled my booking 5 days after making the reservation and 3 weeks ahead of the reservation. My host was pleasant and offered a full refund if she could rebook, which she could. Airbnb charged me a service fee (although no service was provided) and despite their stated policy which reads: ""We may waive the cancellation fee, depending on how many times you’ve already canceled. After that, the following fee will be deducted from your first payout after a cancellation. The amount deducted will depend on when you accepted the reservation and how soon before check-in you canceled"". ",2,"Lisa of Greenwich, CT"
524,"The room was fine... Until we got kicked out of it because AirBnB double booked us, even though we paid through Monday. We got kicked out of our room on Sunday to accommodate the incoming guests. We sat in our truck for 6 hours waiting on Airbnb to resolve this issue, so our last day on our short vacation was ruined completely. Then to top it all off, Airbnb didn't help us out AT ALL. On a good note, Vacasa is going to reimburse us for having to pay for a hotel. I will never use Airbnb again! And I suggest to anyone booking with them to think again. I will only book with Vacasa from now on!",2,"Melody of Huntsville, AL"
525,"They are THIEVES! They blame the Host, but keep their portion of the fees. I am not unreasonable and understand the Cancellation Policy, but we had a Hurricane ruin wedding plans that involved an active Army Service member and they kept 50% (Thousands of Dollars) for nothing with months to go until the date. They are a website and nothing else. Many other Real Estate sites to choose from with the same properties that don't rob customers and then hide from their Customer Service responsibility. Absolute tragedy paying as much money as I did for literally nothing. Be careful with expensive booking... The fees are set on percentage and you could lose thousands for never even staying there after 48 hours even though the event was 4 months away. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!",2,"Lawrence of Raleigh, NC"
526,"As an Airbnb host, Airbnb completely let me down!!! When I rented my home to a customer, I never expected to come back home to a deserted party house. It was very obvious that the woman who stayed there over the weekend threw a party that got out of hand. We submitted pictures and invoices to Airbnb letting them know the damages and proof of what we paid in repairs. Airbnb declined to hold the woman accountable and/or help us to cover any of the costs themselves, with no explanation why. Since then, I’ve decided that the risk of allowing strangers to stay in my home is too risky when the company who is supposed to protect your home doesn't do the right thing. I encourage everyone to steer clear of Airbnb and find another source to rent out your home.",2,"Chris of Denver, CO"
527,"I booked a reservation over a month ago. 2-days before check-in, my Airbnb hosts says that they can't accommodate the booking anymore because they themselves have nowhere else to go???

528,"I've just finished up with more than 16 hours of customer support service and somehow we at no point were able to come to a resolution. I was fully made aware that your policy is to not help find listings for 3rd party bookings and was told several times that this was breaking protocol, but I did at this point let the staff know that I’d stay with my mom as well in order to void the seemingly insurmountable problem. Once we crossed this hurdle, I won't deny that your teams did try to assist us in finding listings we had already found on our own many times over (you have a very big staff, I may have spoken to more than half of them). I will admit that it would have been more helpful if the people helping us and looking at the maps happened to be familiar with the neighborhoods, the real life distances between them opposed to the perceived distances one sees on a map.",2,"Christina of Ridgewood, NY"
529,"Booked the place over 6 months in advance. Received all the confirmations and even an email from the owner. Week before the trip, contacted the owner and he said it was never for rent (at all, which makes no sense). Airbnb promised to rebook and would call me back with options. They never did. I had to call back multiple times. ""Someone will call you tomorrow"" - never did. I called back again (x3), ""I'll send you similar options in 15 minutes.""

Other guests during the same week are booking at $34.00 per night. I wrote this in my chat, AirBnB customer service response ""customers booking weekly or monthly stays are given a discount"". I again reiterated that these were 1-2 night stays. AirBnB responded that I had agreed to 10% discount for customers"". I never agreed to this and the representative is obviously not educated because a 10% discount off of $34.00 would be $30.60. ",2,"Carol of Marietta, GA"

When I had to cancel they refunded my money on the old card. The credit card company will not refund my money to me as Airbnb said they would. Bank of America says Airbnb has to do a chargeback to retrieve the money and then refund to the correct card. Airbnb wrote that they DO NOT DO CHARGEBACKS. It is how their system is set up. They even put in writing that their system always uses the original card number no matter if it has been stolen, lost or cancelled. I am out my money.",2,"Kay of Oregon, WI"
532,"I am both a guest and host. For the most part Airbnb has been a good experience. However I have found they did not protect their hosts. I'm guessing maybe due to who pays them. I clearly offered a strict nonsmoking condo. My guest stayed 2-3 weeks and smoked inside the condo the entire time, to the point the cleaning crew went twice after their stay to try and remove the strong odor of cigarette smoke. In addition I had to change all filters, and clean any fabric, curtains, sofa, chairs, rugs, etc. that absorbed smoke. After the fact I found a cushion turned over on a chair with a cigarette burn in it. ",2,"Robert of Long Beach, CA"
533,"I have been a host with Airbnb for over a month and they are refusing to answer my emails and pay my first payout. First they dropped a number in my bank account which I noticed when the account wasn't showing a deposit, then they locked me out of making any changes to the account and told me they couldn't send the amount until I made the changes. I told them the changes had been made before I was locked out and the account is now set up and working. I have had no reply from them. The help person was no help at all and was saying sales speak with no meaning or relevance. I have found if you speak out they hold you to ransom. Poor service and a pack of thieves.

534,"I rented a cabin near Evergreen Colorado over Labor Day week. The host did not have an honest description of the property. The property did not have a driveway and you were forced to park on the side of a mountain, also the road that lead to the property was a freshly grated dirt road on a steep incline. When we contacted the site about this issue and how unsafe it was they did nothing about it. The host refused to refund any of the money even though we did not stay at cabin. I asked the site to look into this and they choose not to listen to me. The host called me a liar and said that any vehicle could make it to the location. I am out over $700 with no help from the site. It took them over 2 weeks to respond to my claim. The initial email that they sent me said that they would have it resolved in 72 hours.

Six weeks later after two requests from me for information I got another denial. I was not given a chance to make a case for my appeal. I have asked for an independent review. My plan for next steps is to make a complaint to the California Attorney General's office. This is something all complainants can do. Don't waste your time with customer service.

Although that's not what the steps of cancellation showed me on the website. Instead of €946,71 (total paid) - €133,96 (fee) it showed €421,39. Therefore I called Airbnb and by the first conversation the attendant wasn't helpful at all, he didn't know what to answer then he put the call on hold for several minutes. In the end he said ""you should be fine"" & that he would set the system to refund me the full price I paid (€946,71) minus the fee (€133,96), which I agreed. He also confirmed that €812,75 was the amount refundable.",2,"Luciana of Dublin, Other"

How will someone who cancelled and never even saw my place give me a 1 star review for cleaning? I keep asking them to take it down but no, the same robotic answer, ""It doesn't violate our policies."" They are impossible to get in touch with, you can't call them only they can call you.

Yes I knew was 14 days after but had no clue was the time of checkout. Had I known this or if the email was clearly stated I could have review on time cause the homeowners were very great with us during our stay.

I worked with a case manager at Airbnb who promised me a refund on the phone after the stay was over. After the stay ended, I contacted Airbnb and they basically said that they never agreed to anything at all despite the apartment was in violation of safety and cleanliness Airbnb policies.",2,"Jason of Chestnut Hill, MA"
541,"Airbnb is a terrible customer service experience. They told my guest they will refund them without my permission. They had the guest occupy the space, agreed to the guest’s unreasonable request to get refunded and forcibly took money from my account. What did guest bring as an excuse? That the place wasn’t empty of my personal belongings. Like ** grow up and know this is a house not a hotel. Take your cheap ** to the hotel. Airbnb customer care is pure ** people with no appreciation that they are making money out of other people property. They believe they are obligated to issue refund and it is all at the cost of the host. I certainly like to sue them for this and love to get advice on how to do so. Customer care never responds and always promises to call you back but never does.",2,"Hami of Chicago, IL"
542,Refused to re-issue a refund to updated payment method. Refund is in limbo from the merchant to the bank ping-ponging back-and-forth and Airbnb refused to put the refund on the new payment method or mail us a check. They left in my face and refused to let me speak to a supervisor.,2,"Andrea of Palm Bay, FL"
543,"Posted your letter along with my response to our Facebook account and to our FOX NEWS affiliates in D.C. Our hope is that tens of thousands of Airbnb users will be as enraged by your flagrant violation and use of personal information as we are. Needless to say, it is doubtful we'll never hear from you. After all, we are the Deplorables and you are the all knowing, the elitists... called to correct our ignorant ways.",2,"Rob of Tampa, FL"
544,Just saw a story on the local news where Airbnb double booked another family. Thought I would share my story. They did the same thing to me back in Colorado this past June 2018. Never bothered to tell me the house had been double booked. Only way I found out was I saw credit on my credit card statement and I called. Neither Airbnb or host bothered to call and tell me. I had one month to scramble to try to find another house that accepted 2 dogs and everything was booked. I finally found one. No thanks to Airbnb and all they offered was $25 off. This company sucks and I will never do business with them again.,2,"Tanya of Bay City, TX"
545,"I signed up to be a host -- had to cancel (in plenty of time) due to extenuating circumstances. The guest was fine with it. Airbnb charged me $100, and it was totally unclear when I canceled that this charge would later be levied. This is a very shady company and I would recommend not doing business with them.",2,"Cal of Syracuse, NY"
546,"Absolutely the WORST company I've ever dealt with. When our host kicked us out for even daring to call Airbnb due to discrepancies in his listing, as well as having his wife verbally harass and threaten us, Airbnb did absolutely nothing. Completely unhelpful. They did give us a refund and an extra $40 but, at that point, everything in the area was booked or was 300+ a night. They didn't help us find another place to stay, leaving us without a home in Vancouver (we had to sit at the airport for 5 hours, refreshing the page to find another host), and only made matters worse by deciding to contact the wife AFTER we had expressed our concern for our safety. ",2,"Rebekah of Boise, ID"
547,"After staying at the Airbnb quite frequently while I was still looking for a permanent place in the new place I have moved to I started noticing that they will do ""anything"" to keep their business going. 1. They are not allowing any guest to stay continuously in a best ranked homes so that their service fee will add up. 2. They are not checking or validating the safety of the homes and they claim that they are not responsible for any unsafe condition of the homes in the listing. ",2,"Anitha of Charlotte, NC"
548,"My family and I with three kids aged between 1 and 8 years arrived to this ""resort"" yesterday. Immediately we noticed how ruined down the place was. Nothing like the pictures. We decided to walk around and see the rest of the facilities, the family pool in particular breaks any health and safety regulation, I have never seen anything like this before. So, the pool is located next to a drop of at least 50 meters, the edge of the pool (where your kids are meant to walk while playing) has nothing dividing the edge and the pool. If anyone falls into that drop someone will get seriously hurt. Having seen this we decided not to stay.",2,"Jorge of Great Britain, Other"
549,"When arriving at the Airbnb in London, the room was still not cleaned at the check in time. I let the owner know and he said the maid said it was cleaned but I was there and it was not; towels on the floor, bed with dirty linens, completely not cleaned. 30 min. Later still no maid and no clean room, so I left letting the owner know I was leaving not to return. I did not receive a complete refund because they say I didn't cancel and I didn't have proof of the dirty room. This was my first attempt with Airbnb and my last.",2,"Laura of Charlottesville, VA"
550,"We had booked a place to stay but had to cancel within 24 hours of making the booking because a few guests that were coming with us had to pull out. The terms and conditions stated we would be given a full refund in circumstances where bookings were cancelled within 48 hours. It has been four weeks later, four phone calls to Airbnb's customer service and several attempts to contact them on their feedback page but without luck. We are getting increasingly frustrated that the deposit has not been refunded, but what is worse is that the staff at Airbnb don't care. Terrible terrible terrible! Will never use again and advise you to do the same.",2,Steven of Australia
551,I spent a lot of time finding and booking a condo. The host asked a silly question that I did not immediately respond to because I was busy. The host canceled my reservation because I did not immediately respond to his stupid question.,2,"Nancy of Golden, CO"
552,"We have used Airbnb a lot in the past, but this time it was disgusting. Often, Airbnb rentals can be good - but more frequently than it should be, the rentals are not clean. In this case the sheets smelled, and there was visible hair - from the previous renter. We came in late, and Italy was having a heat wave; previously, my wife had gotten heat stroke, so we were just exhausted. So we did not report it to Airbnb right away. Since we waited, Airbnb refuses to help us. Kim, in their customer support department, is not sympathetic at all.",2,"Kevin of Campbell, CA"
553,"I referred another host to Airbnb before I had sufficient experience with their customer disservice department. I was promised in writing a $300 referral fee. This promise appeared on my referral page. All of the customer service people have stated that I am either an idiot or a liar and that this was only a progress bar. The notification on my page said you will receive your money in 15 business days not that my money was pending. Then after complaining to a customer service rep who denied I was entitled to the money I received an email saying, ""Don't lose hope refer another host to get a referral fee."" Having been defrauded one time why would I try it again? There is no way to directly contact the actual department that handles problems.",2,"Erica of Brooklyn, NY"
554,"I booked a room on Airbnb in Brooks, Maine. It said a ""loft"" on a farm. What I found was a dilapidated run down farmhouse with an attic space. A broken down fridge on the back porch, a door with a missing window pane and a filthy kitchen with piles of clothes. The room was almost 90 degrees so I turned on the a/c that was in the room. It blew out cold in front and hot in the back. It was a sauna. So I call Airbnb after speaking to our nonexistent hosts. What did I get - ""Well you should have taken pics."" I said it was 9 pm and I took pics of the room temperature and how the ""loft"" had no privacy door - forget a lock. ",2,"Graciela of Jackson, WY"
555,I had to cancel my vacation and no longer will need Airbnb accommodations. I canceled within the 48 hrs of cancellation policy and the host is refusing to give me a full refund. The host is not honoring the 48 hrs cancellation and full refund policy.,2,"Maris of Boca Raton, FL"
556,"We rented a home in an area near Omaha Nebraska. It looked very nice. The basement was storage and off limits. No problem, we paid hundreds of dollars for four nights and yay! In the first ten minutes we figure out the basement is inhabited by a drunk guy who does maintenance. He left the basement door ajar weaving his truck past our car in the driveway to get away then drove up and down the street. Really scary when he parked pointed into the backyard. Got pictures of piles of booze bottles etc. ",2,"walter of Mesa, AZ"
557,"As of this writing Airbnb and one of their partner hosts, Jacks Realty in West Palm Beach, Fl. have not refunded my money amounting to near $1,600. I booked a rental which turned out to be a health hazard and death trap which is typical of a slumlord type property. We could not stay in the place as it was so unfit and had to find a hotel in the area. I sent many photos as proof of my claim and Airbnb ignored them. The unit was not fit for human habitation and to say the least not as advertised. The property had just been fumigated with signs posted as warnings to occupants.",2,"Ronald of Palm Beach Gardens, FL"
558,Airbnb gave one of my guests a 50% refund - without my permission - because two hornets came into the property. The reason given was that I had not disclosed in advance that an animal was present. Hosts should be aware that Airbnb can refund with no good reason. I will be taking legal advice.,2,Caroline of US
559,Nothing but terrible experiences with Airbnb and their “services.” To say the least this company has poor customer service and does not take any responsibility for any mishaps that occur at their venues. They don’t care about their customers whatsoever or the fact that the places they post on their site could be a scam. They don’t check out any of the venues they post on their site to see if they are legit and meet their standards. ,2,Erin of USA
560,"I had made a reservation at an Airbnb in Quincy, IL. When I got to the place it was filthy dirty. I took about 50 pictures of the place, then sent a note to the host that I would not be staying and also contacted Airbnb with the situation and sent them pictures. After 6 weeks of trying to get my money back nothing has happened except for me getting the run around from Airbnb. The bedroom garbage can was full, bed looked like it was slept in. The towel and wash rags they left in my room for use we’re all stained green and yellow. ",2,"Vicki of Usa, USA"
561,"I have book a home to stay with my family of 5 in Canada but after 2 weeks we have found mice in home and inform Airbnb about it. They cancelled our staying home agreement without relocating us somewhere else. Actually recommended us a place 2000 mm always where we stayed. (Recommended from Ontario to Nova Scotia by a case manager, which I have proof in my email).",2,"Veysel of Usa, USA"
562,"We booked a home through Airbnb and paid the required amount. The next day payment was canceled by Airbnb and we were asked to contact customer service. We did so and the customer service staff we talked to was unfriendly and unprofessional. He did not give us enough details as to why the payment was canceled, especially after it had gone through flawlessly 24 house earlier with the same house. Clearly there was a glitch at their end, but once confronted, they did not give any satisfactory answer and instead canceled the account. As far as we are concerned, they don't have decent customer service skills. They need a lot of improvement and training on basic human service.",2,"E. of Nairobi, Other"
563,"I rented a boat (a 1980 Chris Craft) at the Jersey Shore (Wildwood, NJ). When we first arrived the boat was not was we expected it to be. However, I was ready for the adventure and was willing to overlook the lack of basic necessities as a result. But as time when on, we discovered there were many problems with the boat, for example we had no running water for the first week we were there, the host did not empty the commode from the previous guest prior to our arrival as he told me he still needed to do that (we arrived a day late so he had plenty of time to do this). It was more than a week after we arrived that he finally tended to the toilet and only after we complained of the stench on the boat as a result. ",2,"Cindy of Philadelphia, PA"
564,"Customer Service is unhelpful and degrading. Had an issue with a service they provided, which was a clear violation of their terms and policies, but the customer service agents failed to recognize it. And after several messages, just stopped responding. Seems like they will say anything to get out of actually providing real help.",2,"Benjamin of Los Angeles, CA"
565,"We have used Airbnb for the first time. We booked an apartment in Prague in August 2018. We were happy with the apartment... nice and clean, well equipped and quite central. Metro station, supermarkets and various restaurants at walking distance. The hosts were very helpful before we arrived at the apartment. However, things changed drastically once we arrived there. The apartment was so hot! We were fully aware that there was no air conditioning in the apartment and it happened to be a heatwave. So, we asked for two extra big fans (or at least one more) as there was only one small fan since the apartment was simply unbearable to stay in. ",2,"Kenneth of L-Imtarfa, Other"
566,On 24 July I requested a booking for 7 days with Airbnb. It was refused by the owner but AU $400 was still deducted from my PayPal account. Airbnb promised (by email) a refund within 7 days. Today is August 14 and still no refund. Any suggestions as to a course of action?,2,"Dianne of Paradise Waters, Other"
567,"First of all I’m sure there are amazing things about Airbnb, I was just unfortunate and didn’t have a great experience! We booked a stay through Airbnb for my dad's 50th birthday... the information included “sleeps 8 and has 3 bedrooms”. You could clearly see two rooms had queen beds, but then the 3rd looked like two twins beds. The host confirmed that it was twin beds, so I assumed (it sleeps 8) there must be a pull out couch. Thinking two couples could stay in the queen rooms, we could sleep on the pull out couch and my toddler (age 2) could sleep in the room with two twin beds.",2,"Caitlin of Gander, NL"
568,"Rude and unreliable. You might get lucky and have a good experience but you lose your hard earned money if you are not. Airbnb doesn’t take responsibility of an ill maintained home. Don’t go for it. I ended up in a listing where my father and I got sick within an hour of getting in because it smelled so bad, old and dusty. There was evidence of rodent infestation and the host sounded pretty unapologetic about it! I had to leave and go to a hotel. Upon contacting Airbnb they said since I didn’t give the host “a chance to fix the issues” I won’t be given any refund. Like, how can you fix the first impression of a guest who sees a book eaten at the corner by a rodent in a home you paid for?! Doesn’t it imply that you don’t maintain the house like you should have and now that you are caught, you want to try covering up? I didn’t get my money back - my hard earned money, but I am writing the review so that it can help at least one person!",2,"Piya of Column, OH"
569,"When I was looking to book a stay, Airbnb's website said I would not be charged at booking, which I wanted because I wanted to pay in cash. Well, I was charged. I canceled right away thinking I did something wrong, re-booked, and was charged a second time. I kept the second reservation. I also noticed I did not receive my $40 credit for being referred. My referring friend did not receive her $20 credit either. I tried contacting Airbnb which is a complete JOKE!!! If you're fluent in English, expect to not receive a fluent speaking associate if they even feel like returning your call at all. I was told my account has been activated for 2 years therefore, I was not eligible for a credit. ",2,"Sarah of Sheffield Lake, OH"
570,"When booking rentals through Airbnb. There isn't any explanations about the ""type"" cancellation your HOST has on their property, until you cancel, then that is when you find out WHAT TYPE you have on your stay. The site doesn't say 50% of the TOTAL RENTAL FEE DUE (even though you may have only paid the 1/2 that is required to hold your reservation), it just says 50% refund. Airbnb site also says cleaning fees are ALWAYS refunded, but that hasn't been the case either. VERY DISAPPOINTED in this as to I had 2 separate reservations I just cancelled (1 was not my choice but the other was because of this situation), lost $981.70 (only refunded $12.77 of $875.40 reservation and $31.68 of $1088 reservation))!!! GUYS, this is so unfair!!! RIDICULOUS!!",2,"Wendy of Alexandria, AL"
571,"I booked an apartment in Toronto on July 6, for six days in August. My account was charged for half the amount of the rental. Without notification, my reservation was cancelled. I only learned of this when I checked the Airbnb website yesterday, a few days before check in. I contacted Airbnb Customer Service, and after several attempts, I spoke to a representative. The representative said the host had cancelled (the host said Airbnb had cancelled). There was no explanation as to why, or why I hadn't been contacted. The representative said she was sending the file to a case manager in her group and I would hear from them. I haven't heard anything, even though I have followed up with the representative twice. Because it is so close to check in, it cost me 40% more to book a comparable apartment. Airbnb doesn't take responsibility for anything---it should be regulated the way hotels are. They should be accountable.",2,"Robert of Seattle, WA"
572,"I am currently visiting England from the US. Today, I found out that due to a “glitch” in their system Airbnb has cancelled my accommodations for tomorrow. I am now in a foreign country with no place to stay. I spent ALL day on the phone with them and they do completely admit it’s their fault. The case managers and supervisor said they were going to call me back and then they never did. They insisted on corresponding only through messaging on their app and would just stop responding. This has been an awful experience and after 6 hours they just texted me a $100 coupon. As if that could possibly make up for what they’ve done. I will NEVER use Airbnb again.",2,"Erin of Philadelphia, PA"
573,"Wow! After $877.00 later, hours on the phone, lots of correspondence with the Airbnb Caseworker, who can’t even seem to figure out how many days we actually booked or what actually happened, I’m amazed at the incompetence. I took photos of everything to prove our case. The place looked nothing like the photos and had not been kept up or maintained at all. Airbnb is not even able to negotiate with the host on behalf of a 5 star rated guest with Vacasa, a real estate company who is listing on Airbnb as a “host” who is mismanaging 91 thousand properties as stated by the host when we contacted them immediately upon arrival to the nightmare location. In all our years of traveling the world, we’ve never experienced anything like it. ",2,"Lydia of Flowery Branch, GA"
574,"I have usually been satisfied by the accommodations from Airbnb. Not this time. We were located close to the California town of Visalia. After a long drive, we checked in (Airbnb near Sequoia National Park). To our horror, the air conditioning was not working, and it was 100 degrees outside. Fortunately, they fixed it partially the next day. But then a swarm of ants and many mice greeted us. We left the place early. Clearly the home was not maintained at all. If you can't find a park lodge to live in, don't go at all. The distances are long and the Airbnb homes are not habitable.",2,"Godfrey of Long Beach, CA"
575,"I tried to cancel a reservation I made for Sept 28-30 in Worcester, Ma. I could not find the reservation or easily find a phone number for Airbnb. After three phone call and half an hour I finally found a person who would send me an email confirming that there was no reservation.",2,"John of Wilton, CT"
576,"As their new update policy, they force us to accept it and upload our government issued ID for identity verification. But they do not mention how they can protect our ID from being stolen. I don't believe they have this ability. Besides, including Amazon and any other website, no one ever requires government ID, they should not have the right to do so. It's unfair policy for customers. Thus, I canceled my account, and I will tell all my family and friends to cancel theirs as well.",2,"YANG of Fleming Island, FL"
577,"July 2018, a group of ladies booked an Airbnb in Atlanta. The place was unclean and in a less than desirable location. Upon calling the host and getting nowhere we contacted airbnb and reported the condition of the unit and expressed our concerns. After many phone calls back and forth we ended up at the Marriott and Airbnb did absolutely nothing for us. I would NOT recommend this business to anyone as it seems they back the hosts but do nothing for the patrons.",2,"Paula of Clarksville, TN"
578,"Guest showed up late, locked herself out and refused to take a full refund and go someplace else. Guest trashed me and the place and claimed things completely false or lies with the exception except perhaps in brain, obviously with issues! Airbnb had photos and confirmation of issues and FAILED any conflict resolution! Airbnb allowed a FALSE review to stand and then decided to ban me from their program when ""Safety and Security"" decided they did not want to deal with my persistence and disappointment in delayed payments!",2,"Sue of Kalamazoo, MI"
579,"I recently booked a reservation for a September trip to my hometown in Michigan, a trip I take yearly with my mother and my sister, all of us flying in from different locations. I used the 48-hour-cancel-for-free filter, and upon receiving the street address to the reserved listing, my 83-year-old mother determined the location was unfortunately too far from downtown for her to be able to walk to & from. So I cancelled this reservation within the 48 hours of having booked it and booked a different (and much more expensive) listing closer to downtown. To my surprise, my 48-hour-cancel-for-free refund did not include the $160.95 service fee, which I took to be a clear error on Airbnb’s part, as nowhere on their 48-hour-cancel-for-free filter is it specified that the service fee is non-refundable.

580,"First time user of Airbnb. HORRIBLE experience. Cannot recommend and will never reuse. Completed online registration. Booked room. Owner writes back that, ""I am not comfortable with you."" Taken aback as I was listed as ""verified"" by Airbnb, and he didn't KNOW me so how could he be uncomfortable with me? Then, searched the city to which we were traveling again. Booked. Only AFTER booking do I see that it isn't in the city I was searching but about 30 miles outside the city. Troubled by the fact that the company allows listing outside the listed destination to come up, but learned my lesson. Canceled the reservation without incident.",2,"Devon of Tampa, FL"
581,"We booked a condo through Airbnb for Sept 2018. From Ryan ** Of Indiana. We have a medical situation where our toddler granddaughter needs surgery, it is a have to for her health, we have to travel to Columbus Ohio in September, so we asked to cancel, Mr ** said it was not a reason to qualify for a refund. We canceled 2 months early, he can easily rerent the condo in Gulf Shores, Al. We were told there won't be a refund. That's not right, we were told to expect a refund the 26th of July, now today they said no refund. Airbnb refund policy is very unfair, be careful using this company, if something comes up, you will lose your money. I will never use this company again, nor will I recommend them to anyone, I hope Karma comes around.",2,"Dennis of Decherd, TN"
582,"I have to say, I am very disappointed with AIRBNB service as on 3 occasions, host has canceled my bookings which were made several weeks ago.

583,"As a new Airbnb user, I had some difficulty with two bookings. I had to cancel and rebook. I did rebook and followed thru with the booking. They counted those cancellations against me. My family had me book a family get together and when one of the grandsons was unable to come, they asked me to cancel the reservation. It was expensive. I talked to the homeowner, when I did the booking, explaining that I would cancel, if necessary, within a week, so that he would not lose the opening. When I cancelled, Airbnb charged me a significant amount of money.",2,"Susan of Truth Or Consequences, NM"
584,"Tried to book a property in Halifax with Monica. Never received booking confirmation so I moved on and booked a hotel. Four days later I see an Airbnb charge on my account for $1476. Note: cancellation policy is 48 hours and 50% refund. However, it is impossible to cancel a booking in 48 hours if you don't have it. Airbnb tells me I have 2 accounts and verified confirmation email was sent. Email they sent had invalid address ending in .ccom. They probably received unable to deliver notice.",2,"Jerry of New Braunfels, TX"

586,"Airbnb has no idea what a homeowner has to do in order to keep the home in perfect condition for the next client. And they do not care. As long as they advertise your property and take the money. My personal contract for our beach house clearly states that trashing the house or backyard is unacceptable and carries extra fees for cleaning. However, if you ever got your house or backyard dirty and trashed, to a point that it needs double time for the cleaning service to make it ready for the next client, you cannot get any extra payment - Airbnb claims that since there is no physical damage, they do not charge extra. On top of that, the communications from their agent are sharp, negative and totally inappropriate. My tenants had the backyard full of beer cans for 2 full days, and we had to clean it on Sunday. On my expense. I HAVE TAKEN MY PROPERTY OFF THEIR LIST. We have other agencies we work with who appreciate our business.",2,"Lia of Bethesda, MD"
587,"I had an account years ago that I used with no problem. I tried to log in today to find accommodations in Charleston, SC. The AirBNB site insisted I verify my account and suggested I do so through my cell phone. When I downloaded the phone app, the site wanted permission to access my contacts. REALLY!!?? For what possible legitimate purpose? No other booking site has ever asked me for that kind of access. The next step in the process would have been to send a copy of the front & back of my driver's license, passport or visa. I DON'T THINK SO!!! Can you spell: ""Identification theft""??? Message to President, Chairman of the Board, and CFO of AirBNB: ""I'll send you that information on myself right after you send me the same information on yourselves!"" Sorry AirBNB hosts. No business from my household!",2,"Suzanne of Huntersville, NC"
588,"I hosted for Airbnb and had some great experiences until this happened. One guest booked 7 nights. Then she contacted and asked to extend to 9 nights and would pay cash.

Point - Airbnb does not guarantee you will get paid.",2,"Charles of Point Roberts, WA"
589,"We showed up at this Airbnb house at 805 Red Oak Lane, Arlington, TX, 76012. When we arrived, the AC is totally non functional. It was 85 degrees downstairs and approximately 95 degrees upstairs. A sweatbox. The outside AC unit/compressor hadn't been serviced or cleaned in years as was evidenced by the build up of dirt around the vented metal panel that allows access to the capacitors. The maintenance people who showed up to fix the problem had to dig 3-5 inches down in the dirt just to get the door off because of years of erosion. ",2,"Jeff of Fortson, GA"
590,"The reason for the review is because we have been given vague and elusive behind account block. On 7/24/2018 we reverified our identities and we were reassured that once the transmittal from SSA was received funds would be available immediately. We received no notification or account alert of any ""unusual activity"" unless they count the numerous logins the past 72 hours. Who does not check their account constantly when bills are due. We received creditor extensions due to a security breach at our previous bank. This account ending card ending in ** had always been a mere back up account.",2,"ROBERT of Keller, TX"
591,Unpractical refund/cancellation policy. If canceled within 14 business days and owner is able to rent the unit refunds should be given. How is it that you have strict cancellation policy that only allows a consumer to cancel within 48 hours for a full refund when booked 3 months in advance. It’s best to use Airbnb for short notice hotel reservations. Otherwise you are screwed if owner decide to implement “strict refund policy” and will not accommodate unforeseen circumstances! I’ll stick with hotels going forward! Airbnb app DELETED!!!,2,"Shany of Houston, TX"
592,"I have only used Airbnb one time, in January 2018. About a week ago - July 2018 I noticed a charge for 156.01 with a confirmation number on my Visa dated June 29. I contacted Airbnb and after taking down my information I was told I would be refunded. When I asked how this would have happened, seeing as how I have no payment options saved on my account and my card hadn’t been compromised. I was told they would only release that information under government subpoena. I’m deleting my account.",2,"Matthew of Krestova, BC"
593,"I found recently especially that as a traveler, you feel intense pressure to only give, at worse, a lukewarm review or none at all. A few things everyone should know... your credit card is ""held hostage"" by Airbnb up to 2 weeks after your stay, in case host wants to accuse you of damages. How do we know they won't come up with some made-up problem if they don't like your review? I currently am debating on how to review a host who I can tell from prior reviews takes GREAT offense at ANY negative comments or suggestions. ",2,"Jane of Carlsbad, CA"

The past year and half I experienced the loss of my father on January 11, 2017, the loss of my mother on January 2, 2018, job loss, fighting for unemployment for months, fighting for jobs, fighting to save my apartment and not get evicted for 8 months straight, having my entire network hacked by a family member who destroyed my business that I put years into building, attacked me in front of my mother 4 days before she went into open-heart surgery... the list goes on.",2,"M. of Hackensack, NJ"

When I call the company they won't even talk to me without me giving them the last 4 digits of my debit card. I will not give them this information - I just had fraud committed on my account, why would I give them more financial information. I just spent another hour on the phone with Sheldon and Arvie and I not absolutely no help. Very sure I will never use this company again.",2,"Cindy of Goldendale, WA"
597,"I rented out my apartment to a guest. He broke a bed. I gathered the evidence that Airbnb required, they agreed to pay. They then rescinded their offer, no explanation. They also kept the damage/breakages insurance from the guest. That seems like fraud to me? Do not trust Airbnb.",2,"Stephen of Stratford Upon Avon, Other"
598,"After reading the 15-- 5 Star post and that the host was a Superhost we decided to Rent 911 Riverview Drive, Bullhead City for 4 nights. In the info pack that was sent we were told that the a/c was to be set to 75 degrees prior to our arrival- home was 96 degrees and a/c was off and it took from 5:30 in the evening until 11:30 at night to get temp down to a balmy 88. There were ants in the house, the flooring was torn out in the Kitchen, dining, living and bedrooms and basically a poorly stained and not very clean concrete floor. The oven (see photo) was one of the dirtiest we have ever come across (also the dishes- see photo) so we fixed no meals at the house (one of the reasons you rent a vacation rental). ",2,"Ron of Temecula, CA"
599,"I booked 3 nights stay with Airbnb in Florida. We stayed at an addition room from the main house, which is the owner live. The host is a nice man, no complaints! The reasons that I am writing this review is about Airbnb. We could not sleep on the first night because of the constant noises from the window ac in the unit, and from the ac condenser on the roof above the unit. We could hear the feel the vibration for the whole night. We tried to turn off the ac unit off, but it was too hot. We decided to leave on the next morning because it will ruin our vacation for the sleepless nights. We contacted the host to let him know our decision and left. We contacted Airbnb to ask for the refund of the remaining nights. They refused and claimed it was our fault to leave. If you are not happy with the products or services, it is our right to refuse to pay, although we were willing to pay for the first sleepless night! Airbnb just lost one customer!",2,"Loc of Garden Grove, CA"
600,"Reserved a place in Seattle two months ago for a trip that is now two weeks away. Got an email yesterday (less than two weeks from planned trip) saying that my background check didn't go through because of a criminal record. I have no criminal record. Needless to say I disputed it through the background check company they use and it was a simple mistake, same name, birthday and state, different person completely. They reversed their background check within two hours and my background check came back clean. ",2,"Joshua of Tallahassee, FL"
601,"We just stayed in the Palmer House in New Orleans. One of the beds was infested with wood beetles. We told our Super Host and she told us “they won’t bother you”. She never said “sorry” or “what can I do to make this right."" What she did say was let me sweep up the sawdust pile the beetles left on the floor. The couple staying in that room slept on the floor the next night. The next day when she saw the air mattress the floor she let us know “that we are from the north and just don’t understand bugs."" Not even an offer to get an exterminator in. Following Airbnb policy, we notified them when the issue happened. They notified the landlord and she promptly ordered us out of her lovely home. She even threatened to call the police. ",2,"Vicki of Medina, OH"
602,Airbnb is the most unprofessional and rude business that I ever came across in my entire life. They cancel people's reservations without advised them and without their approval. They like to spin and span their customers as they're pleased. They cancelled our reservations few days before our vacation to Italy. They were trying to get me for more money and give me different places. Of course a lot more expensive. I would urge you to stay away from these crooked people and please spread the word and let good people know how bad is Airbnb organization. ,2,"Nino of Gilroy, CA"
603,I am very upset and angry with the host referral programme. I have invited 4 hosts. And I have helped them to create their account. I gave a lot of time and effort. They have promised 250 for each hosts and gave only 86 euro for the first 2. And for the other 2 they told me the hosts I referred did not used the link I have sent while I am the one who clicked the links and create the accounts to help them. I really hope developers will create a new and ethical platform for hosts.,2,"Gözde of Athens, Other"
604,"I changed my phone number 3 years ago. Went to login into Airbnb account and from my computer and it said it had to verify my identity by sending me a text to my old phone number. Then locked me out of the account because I don't have that phone. No way to update phone number. No way to contact customer service because account is locked and they cannot be contacted without an account. Contacted them with a new account I created and the only response I got was an apology for how I ""felt"" but they apparently refuse to solve the problem or update the phone number. Two weeks have passed. Nothing. Apparently they are so profitable that servicing their paying customers is no longer a necessity.",2,"Gary of Seattle, WA"
605,"Booked an Airbnb in Los Angeles CA a month before my vacation. My family flew into Las Vegas from MD then drove to Los Angeles, a four hour drive. An hour prior to our arrival the host sends a text stating there are issues with the apartment. He suggests another one of his properties but is smaller that has only has 1 bedroom. The property we originally booked was a 2 bedroom. We opted for another property with a different host. Arrived at the newly booked property and apartment was not as listed. Listing stated king bed in one bedroom, was actually a queen and the other bedroom was listed as a queen, was actually a full bed. Wasn’t impressed with the unit but tried to make it work. ",2,"Kathy of Millersville, MD"
606,"I stayed in a house of an extremely conservative Christian Republican. It was so creepy. I think he had the house bugged and he listened to my conversations although I cannot prove it. He was just ok until he heard me without my knowledge having a conversation with my gay boyfriend. Ever since he stopped talking to me and that made me feel so scared. I thought he was going to kick me with guns and everything. But fortunately, he just ignored me which was good. I don't want to be his friend anyway. But my point is that I felt so anxious and stressed because I didn't know if he was going to act violent or what. I was in the middle of nowhere. I didn't have any motel or neighbors nearby. I wouldn't stay in Airbnb anymore. Just going to a stranger house is scary and you don't know what you are going to get, because the reviews are not always accurate.",2,"Pepito of New Bedford, MA"
607,"I'm a host, Air b and ** is forcing me to take all kinds of people with bad reviews. If I don't take them they penalize me by not showing my property when people search, or they fine me money. Disgusting company. They forcing me to host bad people who don't respect my place or other guests.",2,"James of London, Other"
608,"I've been trying to book an Airbnb for a night in Monterey, CA. Yes, it is a busy weekend and prices are at a premium. But it's the property owner's responsibility to do their own research on pricing. TWICE now I've booked a home and the price has been changed to a much higher rate - it's a bait and switch. The first time, I was TYPING IN MY CREDIT CARD NUMBER and the price TRIPLED while I was typing. Thank goodness I looked at the total one last time before I clicked to purchase. The second time, I booked and PAID FOR the home and got a confirmation and everything. An hour later, Airbnb contacted me and said the owner ""had a calendar mix up"" and now wanted to charge me double the rate I paid. I protested, but Airbnb cancelled my reservation, refunded my money and gave me a $25 coupon. Which I won't be using. I'll stick to hotels from now on, thanks.",2,"Maggie of Atascadero, CA"
609,"I used Airbnb for the first time to book a BNB for a planned trip. Airbnb sent a message stating the ""host"" had accepted the booking and then proceeded to bill my credit card for the booking. I made contact with the ""host"" to finalize the details only to be told they knew nothing about me or my booking. They further stated that they had family issues and were not taking any bookings this year. I have made attempts to contact Airbnb but they have no direct contact available and their site tells me to contact the host for a refund. The host was not paid, and as stated knows nothing about a booking. I am still attempting to obtain a full refund, but Airbnb's site policy states a refund minus their handling fees if I can find out how to contact them. The booking should never have been made by them and their practice is deceitful. They state the booking was accepted, when the ""host"" was not even taking bookings.",2,"George of Anchorage, AK"
610,"My mother signed up for Airbnb with a referral code I sent her. She accidentally entered her email as Gmail when it was another e-mail provider. They then changed the account appropriately but every time we tried to log in with her correct email/which they also had as correct on file it told her to please login with her “wrong email account.” The wrong email wouldn’t work either. There was no way to actually log into her account. We spent 2 hours on the phone Saturday, they route your call to Pakistan where the staff giggles at you under their breath and passively makes it harder to solve the problem (for which at heart they don’t want to fix and they find it funny because they hate westerners) and they just banter off the script and say I’m sorry Mr so and so over and over and I understand your frustration over and over.",2,"Joseph of Long Beach, CA"
611,"I am one of the 10 guests that stayed on June 20 and June 21, 2018 at 4 Tchernihovski St. Tel Aviv Israel provided by Airbnb. It is private home with 3 separated units. When we arrived we found that the units are not as shown in the pictures, the bathrooms had mold, the T.V. did not work at any of the units, there was no hot water in the second unit. The water heater in the second unit was hanging in the bathroom from the ceiling above the sink which is great dangerous and most likely against building code.",2,"Yoel of Los Angeles, CA"
612,"We were deceived by an Airbnb host. We wanted to find a place to stay in Niagara Falls, New York and entered that location in the search field of your website for the 7 of us. We looked at the results returned by the search criteria and located one we liked. We took a look at the property photos and description details and that's what convinced us to choose the property as well as the description stating how close it was to the falls. We knew the property had a strict cancelation policy and thought that wouldn't be an issue since we were not planning to change anything about our planned trip.",2,"Emad-ud-deen of Westford, MA"
613,"My husband and I just recently rented a unit on South Beach Florida. We had some real concerns about our accommodations when we arrived. Definitely not up to par for the money we were paying. After contacting the host, with no response, I called Airbnb customer service. I was lucky enough to have Macie answer the phone. Macie became my case manager and what a great one she is! She contacted the host on our behalf and within thirty minutes there was a call from the host. I will say the Host was quite responsive on fixing some of our concerns. However, in order to correct the problems, we had many people in our pad fixing the problems. ",2,"Vicki of Glen Allen, VA"
614,"I've used Airbnb at least 15 times but NEVER AGAIN. I've never been to New Orleans before and was so excited. Six of my girlfriends and I planned a fun weekend getaway. I booked us a house that listed as ""3 miles from French Quarter"" on Airbnb and paid over $1000 upfront (included $130 cleaning fee and $113 service fee and $45 tax fee).",2,"Karen of Davidson, NC"
615,I am a business professional. I have recently had the most horrible experience with an organization that calls themselves Airbnb. Their customer service representatives are rude and they tell the customers not to be rude to them. In that they will hang up on them if they even raise their voice. They have absolutely no respect for their customers none whatsoever. They cancel reservations on their own not their host but on their own and keep your money for up to three or four weeks before it is refunded. This company actions are criminal. In this organization needs to be investigated by the US government. This is the worst company I have ever dealt with in my life. I have never been so offended by an organization ever in my entire life and I hope that the owners of this organization pray to the good Lord for their souls for their criminal actions against their own customers.,2,"Douglas of Clermont, FL"
616,My husband and myself just had a horrible experience renting a place in Montreal Quebec through AirBNB. The pictures were lovely and the Host was a SuperHost meaning he had great reviews and verified by AirBNB. We found out from a person that works at an AirBNB office that someone could not have all those reviews since 2015. This was a scam artist that hacked into the system and is continuing to hack in as AirBNB keeps sending him or whoever money. We called the Host from the airport as arranged (as I had sent him arrival time previously through AirBNB) with the number AirBNB gave us and it went into some strange language. I tried texting the host who went by the name of Stephane but no response. ,2,"Carol of Shuniah, ON"
617,"I booked and paid for a month stay in Colombia through Airbnb. The host contacted me 22 days before arriving and literally blackmailed me; if I did not paid her an extra $450 dollars, she would cancel my stay and leave me without a place to stay. I DID NOT paid her ransom and I asked AirB&B to cancel my reservation and return my funds so I could make new arrangements. They said they CANNOT cancel the reservation until the fraudulent host do it themselves, YES. ",2,"Santiago of Calgary, AB"
618,"Had a horrible experience during our stay in Barcelona. We were victims of extortion and slander by our host who, out of nowhere, decided to accuse us of stealing from him and demanded compensation. We were completely shocked by his claims and reported him to Airbnb immediately. They were absolutely useless in mediating, especially given the seriousness of the situation. They even allowed him to give us a negative review. Needless to say, we will not be using Airbnb ever again! Once they have your money, they could care less about what happens.",2,"Hector of Minneapolis, MN"
619,"So we’re from Canada and made Airbnb booking in Mission, BC. Contacted the host, she gave me a link where I can continue with my booking, paid for everything, our stay with them was great, very accommodating and nice people. But, the night before we’re going to check out I found out that we’re charged almost $1k for 8 nights. From the receipt that Airbnb sent me, it was only $600++, as I was speaking to their customer service agent they couldn’t figure out why I was charged $732 plus a pending transaction of $181. ",2,"Judy of Calgary, AB"
620,"We had a 4 hour delay checking in because the host never answered, and the management took over four hours. Pressed for a review, I was honest, not mean or unreasonable. They never published my review, so I am unable to trust their reviews. Nothing is all positive.",2,"Ela of Enterprise, AL"
621,"Recently I have had a very unexpected and disappointing experience using Airbnb. I made a booking to stay at a Airbnb in Seville, Spain, but my host cancelled the booking less than a week before our arrival. I did not receive any warning and only found out after logging in to check my Airbnb account. From their troubleshooting web page I was told I was to receive a credit voucher for my inconvenience but I never received any message or email as told on their website. When I went to book a new accommodation, all the prices had on average doubled in price compared to my original booking. But when I went to the check out page when making a new booking, I was happy to see they automatically deducted a credit voucher and charged the difference. But later when I went to check my credit card statement, I was shocked to see they had made another charge without my knowledge. ",2,"Minli of Auckland, Other"
622,"We showed up at dusk to the address. The host did not specify that there was an apartment A and B at the same address. And most of the pictures of the unit were of the outside of the upstairs apartment. We went to the upstairs unit, which was the only one you could see at that time of day. When we tried the door a dog barked at us. I thought we might have the wrong address and had the Uber driver take us what ended up being around the block, where we ended up at the same address. I finally noticed there was a downstairs. It was really dark down there (Sam does not leave the light on for you). I had to turn on my phone and all I could see was a key lock, not the key pad we needed to put in the code.",2,"D of Seabrook, TX"
623,"TWICE I have had reservations cancelled for no reason. The first was when I was relocating for a job. I had a Jeep full of belongings, and the guy who took my money for the week suddenly refunded it before my arrival and took his home off the Airbnb market. The next time, a week after starting my job, the reservation was cancelled again with no notice. I called and spent 30 minutes on the phone with the company only to be told that my account was ""under investigation for privacy"" and that my reservation was ""pending"" even though it had been confirmed (and now showed cancelled). The rep had an accent that made much of what he said unintelligible and when I asked for a supervisor, I got more minutes of hold with no one ever coming to the phone. ",2,"James of Portage, WI"
624,"In February 2018 I booked an entire home in Oceanside CA. for three nights July 12-15. Paid over $1,100.00! Need to put my home up for sale the end of April. No idea it would sell in five days. Purchased a new home. Move in date July 8th. Four days before Oceanside stay. Canceled my reservations the start of May. I only received a 50% refund. Cancellation policy confusing as reads - ""FULL REFUND IF CANCELLATION IS WITHIN 48 HOURS OF BOOKING AND AT LEAST 14 FULL DAYS PRIOR TO LISTING'S LOCAL CHECK IN TIME."" ",2,"Mary of Waddell, AZ"
625,"I live near an Airbnb and they are cropping up all over the neighborhood. I feel like I live in a commercial district with prostitution and drugs coming into the neighborhood from all directions. Temporary renters are loud, smoke pot, have disruptive parties, bring in escorts in mini skirts and don't care about permanent homeowners. Unfamiliar cars are strewn through the streets and loud music blasts until late at night. My neighbor reported renters having sex in the backyard where her girl in Kindergarten was playing.

626,"I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND AIRBNB TO ANYONE!!! I had made a reservation with someone who was supposedly ""quick at responding"" which she wasn't. She was out of the country and it took Airbnb a couple days to hear back from her. Like way to communicate with your guests about your property and services and other questions we had. Her and the 3100 employees of Airbnb couldnt simply answer any questions or concerns I had. They will give the runaround for weeks about any issues that you may have. ",2,"Torie of Marietta, GA"

They just simply denied the refund as I couldn't provided so called ""evidence""!!!",2,"Airbnb of Scarborough, ON"
630,"I have several homes, and have hosted through Airbnb for several years. I have recruited other hosts, traveled using Airbnb, and have for many years spoken highly of Airbnb. BUT, now I have nothing good to say about the company. It started when I was out of town and a guest came carrying her bed bugs with her. Airbnb would have you believe that they have a policy on your property to help you if you have financial issues with a guest. This is a LIE.",2,"Allison of Okeechobee, FL"
631,"I tried Airbnb a few times now, I don't like the time wasting of making a booking and then a host declines for no good reason, I was hoping it would be a good alternative to hotels as travel all the time, but I just booked a hotel instead of the unreliability of Airbnb.",2,"John of Select Or Enter, NH"
632,"I first used Airbnb in April of 2017. I vacationed to Colorado and it went smooth and ideal. I left a positive review for the host and the host did the same for me. This was nice because after receiving a positive review, I was able to book instantly instead of waiting for owner to approve it. This came in handy for my next vacation, back to Colorado in April 2018 exactly one year later. I book a house for myself and 3 other guests (all of whom were also verified) in the middle of January 2018. I booked early in order to have a nice place to stay. Our flight left for Colorado on April 18th, 2018. ",2,"Justin of St. Petersburg, FL"
633,"Airbnb is forcing my hand by having us stay at a property that is said to have MOLD, no fire alarms, broken items = UNLIVABLE CONDITIONS. The host, whose name I don’t know, who doesn’t even have a business website, and who is not very responsive says everything is fixed and that the review was fraudulent? Now a new review comes out yesterday stating there are still missing fire alarms, a leaky ceiling, and the worst of them... BED BUGS?!?!",2,"Crystal of Gilroy, CA"
634,"I have used Airbnb to rent out my rooms not realizing that they are thieves. Airbnb stole money several times. I would host guests for four nights, guest will pay all the money, then Airbnb takes it all. I canceled two reservations due to family bereavement. I explained to Airbnb why I had canceled as I could not host the guests due to two family funerals. Airbnb promised to waived the cancellation and pay me back my money which they never did. Two more bookings were made, I clearly told the guest, I can not check you in coz Airbnb is not paying me for my services. Once again that waived fee was grabbed. Guests stay well clear away from Airbnb, families ask for payment before guest check in like any other hotel does! Airbnb are blood thieves! BEWARE!!!",2,"Beauty of Colchester, Other"
635,"I rented a place in Napa Valley for my honeymoon and told the hosts exactly when I would be arriving and kept messaging them with updates. When I asked about a code to get in, they said I should just ring the doorbell. When we got to the rental, they were not there and had not sent over any instructions on how to get in. We called and called and waited and then eventually decided to leave and try to find a place to stay. Airbnb would not refund me for this, and when I disputed it with Bank of America, they refused the refund. I did not stay at the rental and did my part in showing up. I do not understand how I am not entitled to a refund. I will go with hotels from now on.",2,"Reema of Suwanee, GA"
636,"My host decided to cancel my reservations 9 days prior to my stay in order to extend another customer's stay. What is Airbnb doing to protect its users like me who are booking through them? Nothing. They offered me $15.00 extra on top of a full refund to help re-book another Airbnb place or just refund all my money back into my credit card. They left ""host cancelled"" on the host's page, charge them a cancellation fee of $50.00 that benefits them and drop the super host. The worst part was that I wasn't able to leave a review of the host that cancelled on me.",2,"Ydnic of Tacoma, WA"
637,"Airbnb is a joke!!! Not helpful at all. The ""customer service"" reps do not deserve to be paid for the poor service they provide. It's like a three-ring circus. The company advertises falsely.

I hope someone shuts this Mickey Mouse outfit down soon!",2,"Helen of Elk Grove Village, IL"
638,"My wife and I immigrated to Canada from South Africa and made one month reservation with Airbnb, at 722 Queen Street, Kitchener.

Suddenly, last week, I get an email that our reservation has been canceled and our deposit returned. No explanation given, and when I emailed the host, he did not respond. I called Airbnb to say how upset I was and was told someone would expedite the issue and call me back. Long story short, three days later still no call from them, with an explanation, apology or anything. Can't find any good places now as most are sold out for the area we needed. We are beyond furious! We will NEVER use Airbnb again!",2,"Kip of Pleasanton, CA"

641,"We've had a about twenty guests so far on Airbnb. The only issues that have come up is how Airbnb posts guest verification information and their lack of understanding of how it is viewed. We require a government ID from the guest to be provided to Airbnb and look for that information on the person's picture. When we drill down, several items are listed but infrequently, the government ID verification is not there. As a result, I have contacted the guest and Airbnb to find out what the story is. Almost without fail, Airbnb insists they are verified although I can find no proof thereof.",2,"Russ of Tucson, AZ"
642,"Airbnb offers absolutely no protection for the customers in case the homeowner decides to cancel the booking. Even if you have reserved your place and paid all the money, there's no guarantee whatsoever that the owner will keep it for you, up till the very day of your stay. In my case, the homeowner of a NYC apartment deliberately canceled my booking 2 weeks before my $1400 worth stay, so I had to urgently seek a hotel in the vicinity - which turned out to cost me $700 more. On their end, Airbnb couldn't do much, and after a painstaking phone call with their customer representative, the best they could do was to offer me a paltry $15 discount on my ""NEXT"" stay. NEXT STAY?! Well, they are bold enough to think I will ever go back to their website again after that shameful incident.",2,"Olga of Costa Mesa, CA"
643,"When I first signed up with AIRBNB I was excited. I had heard good things. As I used the service more, I started encountering discrimination due to traveling with a toddler in Phoenix area of AZ. One host kicked me out after one night without proper notice because my child was fussy. I was paying 100 dollars per night. When I asked him his name as I was checking in he answered me like he was someone in authority. Not friendly or down to earth. I have had two hosts accuse me of being extremely messy and in violation of house rules. ",2,"Christine of Carefree, AZ"
644,"It is hard to understand how Airbnb stays in business with their non-existent customer service and total lack of concern for people simply trying to do business with them. I chose an available property, emailed the property owner and submitted my payment information. After giving all of my info, I got a vague popup notice from Airbnb saying there was some problem in accepting my credit card information advising me to use their HELP desk if I wanted immediate help. Of course I wanted immediate help, I am trying to book a property for a vacation and the clock is ticking. I tried submitting my credit card information again, getting the same error message. I tried using another credit card and got the same error message.",2,"Steven of San Antonio, TX"
645,"In what other business, are you allowed to charge half the fee within SECONDS of a person hitting the ""request"" button... and it's non-refundable. I believe that is a direct violation of New York State's ""Buyers' Remorse"" laws and I intent to file complaints with everyone I can. Airbnb is nothing more than a free-for-all platform that doesn't protect the consumers who use it.",2,"Frances of New York, NY"
646,"We have used Airbnb for a couple of trips and have had a great experience. Both hosts commented about how quiet we were and how clean we left everything. So we were shocked to receive a refund for the property with no explanation as to why the reservation had been canceled. In December or January, I booked a townhouse in La Jolla for June, as we will be attending a wedding in the area. Now, with the wedding soon approaching, we have to scramble to find accommodations. Airbnb should have the courtesy to tell us why our reservation is canceled. I will not be booking with them, again, any time soon. There are plenty of companies that stand by the reservations they provide.",2,"Marla of Walnut Creek, CA"

649,"Customer service extremely unhelpful. I made a reservation and chose the option to pay 50% now, 50% later. I paid for the initial 50% with my credit card. I received a gift card after I made the reservation and contacted customer service to see if I could apply the gift card toward the remaining balance. They put me on hold for 5-7 minutes and came back saying I could not, I had to pay the rest with credit card. I said that was ridiculous and unacceptable, let me speak with someone that could help me. They said no one could help me. ",2,"Noah of San Diego, CA"
650,"My experience similar to others below. Booked a room, but when checked in, place was filthy, it looked like someone else was living there unregistered, and generally had a really creepy feel. Couldn't stay there, but when attempting to get refund from Airbnb, they will always defer to the host. Because I didn't have enough documentation, they wouldn't give me a total refund. I actually had pictures of the dirty bathroom clearly showing dirty linens, but they claimed they couldn't see anything. So you take a big risk - if your host is a good one, you're lucky. If they're not and misrepresent their place, you're on your own - the host can just lie to Airbnb and they'll defer to them - they are host-friendly, not renter friendly. Not for lone travelers concerned about safety - residence mentioned above (""Parsa"", in Northridge, CA) would have been unsafe, because host never showed up with a key, and there were unregistered guests.",2,"Chad of Clovis, CA"
651,"Booked the entire first week at a cottage in Sarasota, Florida. Place was filthy but since it was Easter weekend AND spring break there was nowhere else to go. Host refuses to acknowledge her place was filthy and publicly called us nitpicky as well as flat-out lied to Airbnb about us. Airbnb has completely ignored our complaints to them even when we pointed out that the host received 2 more 5 star reviews from other people during the same time we were at the property! Since we had the whole property to ourselves, I am curious where these other guests were staying. It's a scam and I will never use Airbnb again and I will tell everyone who will listen about our experience. The name of the cottage is ""Bayou Get-Away Cabin"" in Sarasota, Florida.",2,"Kelly of Welland, ON"
652,"This is for all the folks that has ever thought about using Airbnb.com. I just left a place that was too nasty to stay in. Because I didn't cancel before check in, I only got a sixth of what I paid refunded. Because I canceled I can't leave a review. Keep that in mind when you see awesome reviews. Perhaps current photos of the bathroom would be wise to ask for in advance. As a disclaimer, my first two experiences were great, the last two has been so awful. I will never use this again.",2,"jeni of Plain City , UT"
653,"DON'T USE Airbnb! I requested to book a 3-bed apartment that by the description and pictures on Air BnB looked wonderful. The host asked me to confirm the ages of the people traveling with me before he confirmed the booking. I did just as he asked. He then confirmed the booking, charging my credit card. 5 minutes later he messages me and tells me I will have to share 2 beds and the place is under renovation, unsafe for teenagers. I told him immediately that would not work. Then he tried to backtrack and say it's not really under construction but the rooftop was unsecured and not safe for teenagers. He knew I was traveling with teenagers as he had asked me twice. I told him I booked the place for the view and the fact it had 3 beds. He told me too bad if I cancel. It's my choice and there is no cancelation so I still pay. I canceled immediately. ",2,"Melanie of Lehi, UT"
654,"For the first time I wanted to book an apartment with Airbnb in San Diego downtown but ended with a bad experience. The apartment is given in my search results when I searched for the listings with 2 adults plus 2 children. Airbnb showed this apartment as 'Rare found' and also showed a beautiful view of the downtown as if it is from the apartment. When we actually checked in the apartment, it is not at all child-friendly apartment, no child lock, our 2 year old can easily open the main door and go out, also scary patio from where you can see the down floors from the rails which got the big spaces. There is no view at all from the apartment.",2,"Srinivas of Newark, CA"
655,"Upon gaining access to the rental site we discovered a leaking kitchen ceiling, dangling light fixtures in kitchen and bathroom and no working lights in any living areas. Within a half hour we notified the host that the premises were unsafe and unacceptable and we were canceling. We had to go to a hotel for the 7day trip; this cost a great deal more. Within 12 hours we notified Airbnb of the situation and they assigned a customer support ""agent"" to work on the case. We indicated we were not going to cancel on the Airbnb website because, per their policy statement, doing so within 24 hours of our rental would result in forfeiture of all fees. He assured us ""we were doing the right thing"". A day later Airbnb said they would only refund half the rental/cleaning fees with the other half going to the host! It was obvious that Airbnb kept their service fees and tried to serve two masters, satisfying none!",2,"Nicholas of Woolwich, ME"
656,"After the host of our reservation, I tried to work with a case manager to find a new host, but had a nightmare. Case managers as well as supervisors didn’t call me back for days, on multiple occasions. We ended up having to get a hotel and I was told by a case manager she could reimburse me up to $200 to help cover the difference in the cost of the hotel and my reservation. A supervisor then reneged on that and wouldn’t give me a dime. The supervisor also took several days off while we were trying to resolve this, without notifying me, which would be fine except Airbnb wouldn’t let another case manager or supervisor help. Be prepared to work around their schedules rather than them working around ours. Or just don’t do business with them, I never will again.",2,"Wade of South Bend, IN"
657,"My friends and I booked an apartment with Airbnb about 2 months in advance. When we arrived, it was a scam. The apartment had been rented out to another group. Airbnb support did nothing to help us and did not take our situation seriously. They stranded 3 young females in a foreign city and have refused to refund the $173 we spend on the rental. DO NOT USE this company!",2,"Diana of Littleton, CO"
658,"My wife, two year old daughter and I stayed in Miami last year using one of Airbnb's listings. Upon arriving, the unit had an over flooded bathroom and disgusting sheets. The property manager kept moving us from one unit to the other to accommodate his other guests, and when we complained he threatened us - taking advantage of our situation with a child - and told us any complaints will make us end up on the streets. Airbnb made us leave the location for our safety, and the matter was considered resolved when we were offered a coupon to use and in return we would not file an official complaint with authorities. We now want to use this coupon (which is under my wife's name), but my wife is unable to travel. Airbnb refused to have me use the coupon which expires in 1 month, thus rendering the situation unresolved. We wasted our vacation and money, and it seems like legal action should have been the right solution.",2,"Ashraf of Winchester, MA"
659,"As a host I have brought many concerns to the staff of Airbnb over the years only to be contradicted or told that ""nothing can be done"" about my issues. The latest of them concerned a very satisfied couple who had stayed with us for 3 nights prior to leaving on a cruise. When they returned, they were very disappointed to learn that their 5 star review was not accepted because it exceed the Airbnb's timeframe for reviews of 14 days from the close of their stay. THEY WERE ON A CRUISE! They were having fun and they figured they'd wait till they were back in the comfort of their own home to compose a nice review. No such luck...another one of Airbnb's ridiculous policies (of which there are many more).",2,"Caesar of Wilton Manors, FL"
660,"Two days before my travel date, Airbnb canceled my reservation because of a past offense in the background check. I’ve been renting from different hosts for a year, given and received positive reviews, never had complaints from hosts, and never had issues with them. Even though I got a refund, I still have to scramble to find a place to stay at the last minute. I did not attempt to contact Airbnb because I’ve read that they give no help or response to people whose accounts they deactivated or banned. Airbnb say they don’t discriminate, but they judge people by their past. An offense 10 years ago will get you banned. It’s only a matter of time.",2,"Terence of San Antonio, TX"
661,"I have been cancelled by Airbnb twice as an active guest in less than 30 days. I booked one In San Francisco then another to Jenner beach For the remainder of my stay in Cali to visit my sick mother. Less than 1 week of my travel dates I get an email cancelling my Jenner Beach reservation that has been charged to my account/cc already. Instead of telling the truth that someone made a mistake of posting such the wrong price instead they tried to claim that the host was contacting me outside the website. Which is a lie, because the host never responded to me but manage to approve only the reservation with no words of hey or how. “Deep breath house” hosted by Jacqui. ",2,"LAILANI of Concord , GA"
662,"Booked a vacation on my debit card, instead of my credit card which overdrew my account. I got the notification within 2 seconds of clicking confirm on Airbnb and called them immediately (waited on hold for 15 minutes before talking to someone). I asked if they could stop the transaction and if I could just give a new credit card number. They said no, they could not. I asked if they could cancel the booking and just rebook over the phone with a different credit card, they told me I had to cancel online and rebook but pay all the cancellation fees. What a ** joke! So I had to spend an hour out of my workday to drive up to my boyfriend's work, get his card, withdraw money from his account, go to my bank, make the deposit to cover the overdraft. Such a hassle!",2,"Ashley of Encinitas, CA"
663,"They keep your money if you cancel a transaction. Instead of sending your money back to the credit card, they keep it as a COUPON. If you don't check and don't ask, the ""coupon"" aka your money expires after 1 year and you lose it!!! Also, if you see a room but are not sure and don't book it, when you get back, the price is much higher. The taxes they charge the host and the guest are not clear. I spoke to hosts who told me they were charged much more. WE NEED SOME AGENCY TO INVESTIGATE AIRBNB.",2,"Roberto of Bronx, Other"
664,This past week I had a tenant stop their monthly payment to Airbnb and skip out in the middle of the night. This violates my cancellation policy. Airbnb told me they would take care of the money and that particular Airbnb staff member never documented anything. The second Airbnb staff member said after three attempts to collect they would send the case to collections. That was several days ago and of course Airbnb has no phone number that they can give me to talk to the collections department. I am receiving no support or assistance in spite of their claims that they do so. Homeowner beware. If the tenant skips out it does not appear that Airbnb provides any assistance with collecting the rent.,2,"Marie of La Mesa, CA"
665,"I purchased a week April 6-9 and then a month June 6- July 6 of rooms for my wife and I's honeymoon (out of country). That was a little over two months ago. I woke up this morning to an email saying that every one of my rooms had been refunded. I leave tomorrow so I did the natural thing and panicked. I tried to log into my account but could not. I then received an email stating that not only was my account deleted but that I'm also screwed out of all my reservations. Turns out that, my probation that I had completed on deferred judification made it where, I did meet their requirements to stay with any of the lodgings.",2,"John of Liberty Hill, TX"
666,I booked an apartment through Airbnb for an extended stay in Italy. The host could not meet for check-in because he stated he was going to be out of town. I had a friend that lived locally to pick up the keys for me. My stay was shortened due to credit card fraud. I left the key with the same person that picked them up since he was not available for checkout. The host called me at 2am demanding keys which I did not have. I was already out of the country but the host wanted me to call his relatives to make arrangements. A few hours after that call I received a bill for over $500.00 to have a lock replaced.,2,"Suzanna of Las Vegas, NV"
667,"We stayed in ""Ueno Sharehouse for Backpackers"" last March 21, 2018. We checked out at 10 am the next day. At around 2:30 pm, host is accusing us of breaking the cup/glass in which we even did not use as we have our own bottled water. Host is asking us to pay additional JPY 800. We appealed to Airbnb and the only thing they said is: ""We feel this is fair as your host reported the damage before the next guest checked in"". Clearly, they just take the side of the host. They did not review the guests' appeal carefully. What if the host is just doing that for its random guests just to take extra money.",2,"Joanne of Santa Rosa, Other"
668,"I have stayed at various Airbnb places over several years, and while most all of them have been ok or some very nice, others simply do not live up to what is advertised and end up being ""disasters"". And when there have been OBVIOUS issues with customer service and the places...i.e. filthy carpets, bathroom and zero amenities as you would expect from a bnb...oh wait, even the name is Airbnb, I am told that many places are just rooms in homes for rent with many other permanent renters already living there. Not really bnb's. Well, that is false advertising. ",2,"Fabian of Grants Pass, OR"
669,I was headed to Columbia for a bachelor party. Booked the wrong place due to location and also a friend that visited the location and informed me the looks were nothing like the pictures. Also was in a unlicensed building. So I called claims and tried to cancel. Airbnb informed it was the host decision and of course the host declined due to very little bookings. The full payment was 9k. They took 50 percent. I cancelled 30 minutes after booking. Their claims manager took days to respond and took the side of the host. I live check to check and they wouldn’t even accommodate a common mistake. Their concern is for their hosts not their guests because that’s their money maker. They by far have the worst customer service information. I will be reporting them to the Better Business Bureau and recommend that no one use this company. Please spread the word.,2,"Nathanil of Cerritos, CA"
670,"I booked an apartment on Airbnb 3 months ago. Apartment was shown available on Airbnb. Just after booking and paying I got information from host, that it was a mistake and apartment was overbooked. Airbnb didn't help to refund my money. Above all they refused to refund service fee, even though they wrongly offered an already booked room. Fortunately I had a honest host who refunded me completely. Comment of Airbnb: ""It's illegal!!"" NEVER AGAIN. I deleted my account. Can't recommend Airbnb.",2,"Thomas of Wallisellen, Other"
671,"I feel that the main problem with Airbnb is that it allows a lot of bad hosts to get business that they would otherwise not get if not for the visibility that the Internet provide them. Many bad hosts are just very good at manipulating their image and reviews on the Internet so that they can take advantage of guests to make a quick profit. I am referring to the hosts which most guests would not decide to choose if they had been able to see the place in person, that is, in those cases where there are pretty obvious gaps between perception and reality. I also had hosts giving me false names, contact information, or pretending to be medical doctors or something else about them difficult to verify and I was surprised to find out that there is no Airbnb policy to discourage that. On the other hand though, Airbnb policies are tough on guests. Not fair. Airbnb policies are too biased in favor of hosts in my opinion.",2,"Steve of Toronto, ON"
672,"When I booked my accommodation with Airbnb I saw the big print ""Free Cancellation"" (up to a week before arrival). Unfortunately, I didn't read the fine print that the cancellation does not apply to the service fee. Very disappointing that no watchdog is reviewing this type of deceptive practice. What would it take to have small print directly near the words Free Cancellation? Unfortunately, Airbnb has several ways to hide information that they don't want others to see.",2,"Klaus of Vancouver, BC"
673,"Airbnb Hawaii. A ""charming cottage"" from hell at AirBnB. We sweated it (never used Airbnb before and won’t again) it as the owner would not release the address until the day before. As a group of three (one being my 18 year old son) we came to Oahu on business in Sept 2016 for 18 days. We felt getting a group lodging might be less expensive compared to getting 2-3 hotel rooms in Waikiki.",2,"Al of Murrieta, CA"
674,"This is the original email I sent to Airbnb after I called them and they asked me to type up my complaint. ""I will send pics to follow after this email. I wanted to first describe the experience with Joseph in Siesta Key. This was a two day reservation totaling $3650. It was a completely overrated stay. This is a 1.8 million dollar house that should have been in pristine condition. There were many red flags upon arriving. But upon arrival we overlooked some looking forward to a weekend for my best friend of 20 yrs getaway before she gets married. So rather than a bridal shower we decided to find a place to stay where we could all gather and hang out without going anywhere. This house was definitely not what we expected. There were Cheerios on the floor by the front door. Fingerprints on all the siding glass doors. It was clear the countertops of the kitchen were not wiped down before our stay dispute the $250 cleaning fee that is required.",2,"Angelica of Lutz, FL"
675,My business partner booked 2 different accommodations for a week long trip in London. Both locations were rated as 5 stars and both were unacceptable-less than 1 star. I could not stay at either for fear of bedbugs or worse. As a woman I feared for my safety in both locations. Both reservations were cancelled upon arrival and yet we charged full price for both locations. Airbnb's response to resolve the issue was equally unacceptable. We were forced to pay for the full 5 nights even though we cancelled and did not stay in either then we had to find last minute hotels at 350CDN a night. The stress was unbelievable. I will never recommend Airbnb to anyone. Hotels have spent years gaining their stars whereas any Joe can operate a bug infested rooming house. Call it a house with a private room for rent and have who knows who to write up phoney reviews for them. BUYER BEWARE. Airbnb is a scam.,2,"Barbara of Beaumont, AB"
676,Airbnb will take your money when it should be refunded. I was not informed where the keys were located to enter my reservation so I cancelled with the host before I arrived due to not feeling safe to travel there without an understanding of how to securely lock the unit. I did not stay there for reason of safety and the lame customer service and host decided to keep my money and ignore the good faith effort to cancel before I arrived and my concerns for safety. Do not trust Airbnb... They will steal your money and they have hosts who ignore obvious reason to refund money.,2,"Brenda of Ross, CA"
677,"I was a host on Airbnb with 7 apartments in the busiest location in the world for 2016- Osaka, Japan. Over the course of 3 years, I gradually scaled down the operation to just 1 and transferred to different website. Just now, I removed my last apartment from Airbnb and I cannot describe how relieved do I feel now, when I don't need to deal with these ** anymore. At first, they had great customer service and call centers. Then the sudden expanding of the company caught them unprepared for the size of their operation and the problems they haven't thought could appear. All in all, partnering with them cost me a lot of money, loss of business partners and respect from local community. They would randomly take side with clients, trying to cancel reservations with BS excuses, so they will not have to pay cancellation fee.",2,"Ivaylo of Varna, Other"
678,"So I recently put I a report for Airbnb, happily they are going to refund me. I still do not plan on using them in the future... This is a copy of their reply. I hope this is helpful to others... If you. have a problem with a refund dont give up.",2,"Shanie of Hernando Beach, FL"
679,"Airbnb refused to refund what I paid for renting a condo unit that was not suitable for rent or even for staying in it for one free night. We paid near 150 USD for three nights and I got refunded only 40 USD. I had both legal and ethical reasons to cancel upon checking in and viewing the place: The only aircon in the large condo was not working properly. The host representative who checked us in advised us to just restart the aircon every time it ""dies"" and it did stop within 10 minutes after we checked in. The host expected us to get up throughout the night to restart the aircon when it ""dies"". The host later denied what her rep told us and claimed that the aircon was working fine, although two people witnessed what the rep said. ",2,"Samuel of Sanford, NC"
680,"The house was supposed to sleep 8 and only slept 6, it was supposed to be 15 min from French Quarter, it was 30 and sometimes more depending on traffic. The refrigerator did not work so all our food ruined and the owner never sent anyone out. The garbage disposal was also broken. We had to buy a air mattress and ice chest which was an extra expense and time from our vacation. Then a code enforcement officer shows up and says that this Home is being rented out illegally! I will never use Airbnb again!",2,"April of Fort Worth, TX"
681,"I had a reservation at this room from 3/9- 3/12. We could only stay one night because the conditions were so deplorable. We were promised a rollaway bed and air mattress because there were 3 men staying. When we checked in neither was there upon check in, they finally dropped off air mattress with no blankets or pillows, then it didnt fit on the floor flat as room was too small, bathroom was full of mold, tiles caved in and falling off walls. These are not safe or healthy living conditions. They refused to refund me for the night we could not stay, they also refused to refund me for a future stay 6 months from now!! Do not use this company!",2,"Charles of Orlando, FL"
682,"On the 11th of March, I booked an apartment in Poland. The response of the host was that the price was higher for the period (Christmas) that I booked. I filed a complaint at Airbnb stating that the EU Directive for Consumer Rights does not allow traders to change prices. It states: ""Traders are obliged to display correct and complete pricing information before a customer makes a purchase online"". Additionally, Article 7.12. of the terms and conditions of Airbnb for hosts states: ""You are solely responsible for setting a price (including any Taxes if applicable) for your Listing (“Listing Fee”). Once a guest requests a booking of your listing, you may not request that the guest pays a higher price than in the booking request.""",2,"Ralph of Nieuwegein, Other"
683,"I don't know if Airbnb recently outsourced their call center or what but their service has gone way downhill. As a host that has two properties on Airbnb and VRBO I used to think Airbnb was much easier to do business with but that is not the case anymore. They changed my cancellation policy without notice, they've refunded my guests without consulting me, and after 5 years and hundreds of thousands of $ in bookings, they recently notified me that I am at risk of having my account suspended for ""only"" having a 4.7 Star rating while 81% of 170 reviews are 5 Star reviews. Besides the fact that math does not work, I'm not sure it's possible to get much better rating than 4.7 and I don't appreciate being their aggressive and condescending threats. They are so tone deaf and their customer service sucks. Better to use VRBO as host or traveler.",2,"John of Santa Cruz, CA"
684,"Mark, my ""host"" in London, was exceptionally aggressive when we were a few minutes late checking out, and has now left patiently false feedback regarding our stay that I am afraid will prejudice future hosts.

We left without comment.",2,"Philip of Vienna, VA"
685,When I first started using Airbnb I felt their services were excellent. In the last year I have noticed a complete change of customer service toward hosts. Last night trying to resolve a very simple problem of a guest requesting staying another night and trying to pay - it took 3 hours and at least 5 people to talk to. I was actually yelled at by one rep and told I should not charge them at all! Excuse me - why the heck not! I had some guests who were just filthy and had the house smelling like a garbage can.,2,"Donna of San Jose, CA"
686,My family and I rented a condo through Airbnb which got broken into. The owner did nothing about it or the items that we had lost so we wrote a review on his page. He flagged it and it got removed. We followed the company’s review policy and did not violate it. I have lost confidence in Airbnb if they will not allow the negative posts along with the positive ones. How will future guests ever know that their safety or personal property can be compromised at this location? Very poor judgment by Airbnb!,2,"Audrey of Decatur, IL"

On the third day, we came back from an all-day fishing trip and several of our electronic and personal items had been stolen from the condo, approx $1800. Property owner strongly discouraged us from calling the police, advising that he would check it out. He did absolutely nothing. Airbnb would not accept our review due to their policy that no negative feedback is allowed. We will not recommend Airbnb because they do not allow honest reviews that reflect negatively on their property owners, even when it involves theft and personal safety.",2,"Carolyn of Bloomfield, NM"
688,"I have always been a pleasant guest at any Airbnb I've stayed at, and have never had a single negative review.

689,"The customer service is now past terrible. Airbnb is making adjustments on payments on their own, holding payments and doing it in a sinister manner where host and co-host are each unaware of each other's transaction which makes it easy for the payments disappear. Airbnb didn't honor a simple cancellation policy more than just once. Today I find out that I have a guest coming in few days, but I'm gonna end up owing Airbnb 250$+ after all transaction, because they claim I may owe them some money from March 2017??? If you are one of those owners that need to know when and how you are getting paid, this is gonna be nerve racking altogether.",2,"Mike of Lancaster, CA"
690,Airbnb has denied to pay any money to me against the guest insurance claim. The house where I stayed burned to the ground which was caused by overheated wiring in the walls due to improper installation. I have been chasing Airbnb customer care for past 2 months and finally they have sent an email saying that they do not pay insurance for these type of incidents. If not for FIRE incident then I am curious for what type of incidents they pay the insurance and why they charge money for insurance. This incident could have been avoided if proper inspection was done by Airbnb. The American guests who stayed at the same house got the insurance money from Airbnb 3 weeks ago without any pain. This is a complete torture and racial discrimination by Airbnb. Please advise what I can do in this country as an immigrant to claim for my loss. I can share more proofs on request.,2,"Priya of Seattle, WA"
691,"Even if this is very convenient and looks like a great idea at the beginning, it becomes increasingly frustrating to USE Airbnb... and I say USE for a good reason, because there is NO consumer respect from this organisation, it feels like you are dealing with a machine.

694,DO NOT BOOK WITH AIRBNB. We booked a reservation with a host SEVEN months in advance. We went to confirm our stay with the host a week before leaving and they said they were not going to honor our reservation. Apparently they were not allowed to offer Airbnb in the residence anymore. They failed to tell us that. So we call Airbnb and request a refund and compensation to pay for a hotel (as we are 4 days from the trip - spring break in Cancun) they offer TEN PERCENT of the original stay. Trying to find a place to stay in this location and time is IMPOSSIBLE AND EXPENSIVE. I guess their customer service thinks that an extra $40 is enough to pay for a last minute reservation. THEN the refund was supposed to take 5-10 days when we leave in 4... Only after talking to 4 customer service reps and a manager was I able to get an extra $100 (which I'm not even sure I will be getting). ,2,"Cassie of Duluth, MN"

This was followed by ferries, hotels en route, etc.  A week before our departure date, Martin sent me an email stating that the apartment was no longer available, but due to him being a ‘Superhost’, he needed me to cancel it because otherwise he’d lose this status.

698,I FEEL ROBBED - Airbnb claims that a host should be worry free of damage done by a guest. WRONG! They will NOT Pay me for extreme damage that my guest has also admitted to me through messages that I showed them. They are telling me to resort through other options and wished me future luck with future guests. Their responses came on graveyard hours which is a scam because they only give a week to get estimates. I gave them an estimate from a reputable contractor that is licensed and sent them the messages from the guest and it still wasn’t enough for them. Scam company. Do not use them unless you are prepared to pay for any and all damages. This is the third time I’ve had damage and not one was paid. Enough is enough.

700,When Airbnb changed their calendar format it cancelled all my blocked dates. I did not know about this until a guest made a booking on a blocked date. Of course I had to regret and apologize to the guest. Airbnb only arrogantly warned me that they would remove my listing if it happened again. I explained what had happened but no apology... US companies never apologize... must be their lawyers. Also I get guests that ask for contact information and I have to tell them that Airbnb does not allow it. Airbnb puts all the onus on the hosts. Their model is good but fading fast. I would love to have other business to work with.,2,"Al of Shemlan, Other"
701,"Last year during the summer I rented an RV in Winter Haven in order to take the family to Legoland. We arrived at the RV and from outside it seemed nice next to a pond. We stepped inside the RV and the family got hit in the face with a poop stench. We couldn’t get ahold of the owner until a few hours later. Wife and kids couldn’t breathe because of the horrific ODOR emitting from the toilet which engulfed the entire RV. Finally, we jumped back into our car and drove to a nearby hotel.",2,"Miguel of Pompano Beach, FL"
702,"The biggest crooks and the worst business ever. They removing reviews of bad guests with no reasons because they know bad reviews gonna demolish people accounts and they not gonna use Airbnb and go to hotels, because hosts wouldn't host them. It happened at least 3 times with me when Airbnb always could find something in my negative review to guest that violates their policy. The last case was literally catching off guard when the guy who stayed in our hostel made a drama on his last night staying when police almost came over because the girl he hang out with accused him in putting illegal substances in the drink and this screwed up idiot lost his wallet under the bed accusing people in stealing it. We saved that idiot from police almost coming for him because we talked to the girl and calmed her down. ",2,"Sergii of Miami Beach, FL"
703,I would give it a zero if I could. The room at the Fontainebleau that was reserved 6 mos in advance and paid in full with receipt and reservation number was not cancelled by the owner the day of arrival. We flew across the country for Valentine's weekend and now I am now fighting to get my money back for a room that didn't exist.,2,"Gary of San Clemente, CA"
704,"Found a great home on Whidbey Island ""Anchors away"" right on the beach. Will be there for a wedding later this summer. After inputting all my info, they then decide my ID is not a match with my picture. Hello. That's me. What can you do? They thought it was OK enough to take my $1000 payment for the rental! Then cancelled my reservation at 2 am the next morning, stating they couldn’t ID me! Never called, never gave me a chance to submit another picture.",2,"Colette of Stevensville, MT"
705,"Rented home in Cape Coral, Florida thru Airbnb. The host was Michelle of MHB Property Management. The house **. When we arrived we couldn't get in. The host had to be called, the host didn't return the call. Another person we had not dealt with did, after we go in there were no directions to operate the pool or hot tub. Again we called the host but no one returned our call, the stove was leaking gas so bad the women were scared to use it (very dangerous situation). The maid service left a note apologizing for not completing the cleaning of the house which we paid $325.00 for the cleaning service. Contacted Airbnb and the host company and they blew us off because THEY WERE ALREADY PAID! Sad state of affairs!",2,"Terry of Gaylord, MI"
706,We rented a house from Airbnb for 3 days. The description never said it was a trailer/modular home. First arrived and there was a garage right by the back patio. Man came out wearing a pair of jeans and no shirt. He was not the host. He worked most of the day. Customer service said that since I didn’t have a picture of the man it was out of their hands. Dining room light was missing 3 light bulbs and kitchen ceiling fluorescent light did not work. Call host and they brought us over light bulbs but kitchen light was never fixed. Pulled a baking pan out and it was full of rust. Stove burners did not work. There was food under the couch cushions. Description said House was walking distance to wineries. Not true. Contacted customer service when I got home to requests refund and sent them some of the pictures I took. ,2,"Monica of Lapalma, CA"
707,"I booked a place for my husband to stay for a month. What transpired was horrible. The place was cluttered. The bed had missing planks and you fell through sometimes. Fridge was filthy. The worst part was the bathtub screen was broken, so to get in and out of the bathtub/shower you had to sit on a ledge and squish your feet around. My husband hurt his back getting out and he finally checked out. The air conditioner doesn't work in the room he booked and in Australian heat this is unacceptable.",2,"Anne of Docklands, Other"
708,Last week I booked a place for my family to stay for a week through Airbnb. After a couple of hours I received my reservation confirmation. Within a few minutes I received a text from the owners stating that the amount was not right and that it would be several hundred more dollars per night if I wanted to stay there. I thought it was some kind of a scam! I had to leave my home for the evening within a few minutes of getting this text. I thought I would wait and see if anything more would come of it. When I got home I immediately went to bed. After I was asleep someone from Airbnb called me and woke me up. I heard them say something about an emergency. I said I was sleeping and they had woken me up. And I knew it was not an emergency!,2,"Garnet of Backus, MN"
709,I was part of an adult and professional family who rented an expensive house through AIRBNB for four weeks so I speak from bitter and first hand experience. On both sides of the house we rented through AIRBNB there were major construction works being carried out. Let me be clear - these were not renovations or extensions or repairs - but brand new builds. THEY DID NOT COME ABOUT AFTER OUR BOOKING BUT WERE KNOWN TO THE HOST AT THE TIME OF BOOKING. They were major building sites - in what was described as a quiet residential area. At NO time whatsoever did the host point this issue out to us. The overriding comment I am making is this. Problems within a rented AIRBNB can crop up after the 24 hour period. They do not always happen within the first 24 hours.,2,"Joan of Hebden Bridge, Other"
710,"I recently went on our first trip to Europe, just my 10 year old and myself. One stop was in Denmark for 3 days in December. The apartment we rented from Jaroslav and Lina ** had no heat and wasn't as described. Upon entering, there was an unusual smell, but we just figured that different countries cook different foods and not every place smells like home.",2,"Cristie of Leetsdale, PA"
711,We have had 2 cancellations with Airbnb. Last one they had $2000 of our money for almost 5 months and cancelled with no interest or bonus at all. Of course no other places or I would have picked them initially. We booked VRBO for years and never had an issue.,2,"Darlene of Regina, SK"
712,"My daughter and I both tried to take pictures of our government issued IDs and our faces, in order that we might make a reservation. We are not stupid. We have both graduated from high school which should be all one would need in order to fill out a reservation. In addition, we have between us two Bachelor of Art degrees, two Master degrees, and one Ph. D. But could we make a reservation? Why no, we couldn't. It seems neither of us was capable of taking pictures that were up to Airbnb's standards.",2,"Judy of Brooklyn, NY"
713,"Very troublesome and deceitful - I booked an accommodation with AirBnB. They sent a confirmation number confirming complete and paid reservation. The next morning they canceled my reservation, saying I needed a new photo and government ID. They should not have confirmed and charged me if they didn't have all the information they required. This happened once before as well.",2,"Pamela of Rockport, MA"
714,"I was a host on Airbnb and the guest completely ruined my home. I wrote a negative review of the guest but Airbnb removed it. Airbnb does not what negative reviews to impact your profit margin. That means you don't see negative reviews of guests, Which means you are unprotected. That means that guest will destroy someone else's home. Airbnb is unethical and hypocritical. They talk about community but it's a lie.",2,"Ann of Dundas, ON"
715,"Recently, the Trust and Security Dept. took my account offline because some unknown source may have hacked it. I was promised the situation would be resolved in one day and it's been more than a week that my account has been offline. I am a SuperHost and have had this status since the company started the program. As a SuperHost, we have tasked with making 5-star reviews in Communication, Accuracy, and Value. Obviously, Airbnb cannot produce the same.",2,"Julie of Burlington, VT"
716,"Airbnb refused to accept a complaint regarding 726 7th St., Astoria, OR, a property advertised on Airbnb that the inside temperature was only 5 degrees warmer than sleeping in a car/outdoors in the winter in Oregon.

The female hostess throws insults at guests who request a refund.",2,"Carolyn of White City, OR"
717,"My family and I wanted to visit Montreal for 3 days and decided to book a place through Airbnb, instead of paying for hotel. The booking process was easy and simple as usual, so no problem there. The day we were supposed to arrive, our host told us that there is a leak in his condo and is unable to host us. He was extremely nice and offered us a free stay at another condo, however we wanted something different so we declined the offer. We went on Airbnb AGAIN, because we thought we just had a bad luck and it was nobody's fault.",2,"Natalia of Ottawa, ON"
718,I am a homeowner listing on Airbnb. Their customer service is horrible. My listing is corrupted so that I can't respond to requests for bookings. I have spent hours on hold with a series of reps who haven't helped. One rep refused to believe my story and I had to send her screenshots of the problems on the site. After spending 20 minutes on hold each time I got cut off twice. Supervisor was supposed to call me back. He never did. They redact emails and phone numbers so you and potential guest can't contact each other directly. So far I have lost 2 bookings. And don't know what to do next.,2,"Lorna of Brookline, MA"
719,"Rented what was billed as a ""very nice condo on a golf course"". When I arrived it was actually a filthy trailer soaked in cigarette residue uninhabitable. The pictures used in the ad were not even the same property. The host persuades you to pay her directly on PayPal, then when you arrive offers a refund when you can't tolerate staying there. She never provides the refund & Airbnb won't help you because you've paid the host directly (at her urging of course). This is the listing, in Cathedral City CA: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4949043. Beware of this listing. Airbnb continues to provide listing for this fraud. In person she appears with her elderly mother & the 2 of them are extremely charming. The charm ends when you attempt the promised refund and the host begins hurling insults via text & email.",2,"George of Rio Nido, CA"
720,"No rating as so poor... Arrived at a property at 3.30pm for 2 nights, left following morning at 11am. Property filthy in places especially kitchen- oven and fridge, bed at point of collapse, prescription drugs for owner in drawer in the kitchen accessible to anyone (we had children with us). Owner refusing 1 night's refund as we left without giving them notice or chance to rectify?! Would have taken them longer than the 2 nights we had booked to rectify! Airbnb NO help! In favor of owner! Absolutely disgusted with their total lack of care! Ripoff company! No wonder on Ripoff Britain this morning!",2,"Alison of Holme Hale. Norfolk, Other"
721,"I had what I thought was a confirmed reservation for Ken's condo in Bangkok. And, about one month out, I received an email that Ken had ""canceled"". I could not believe it. Host are able to cancel. And, while Airbnb claims the host is penalized... The renter receives NONE of that penalty (it goes to Airbnb). So, you are simply left out in the cold to find another condo. Well, I suppose I could just ""search"" for a different condo. But, what happens when that host cancels? And, Airbnb claims to put notification on the host's page that he/she has canceled. One week later there is still no notification for other potential renters on Ken's page. Simply, BEWARE.",2,"Ben of Goddard, KS"
722,"Guys be careful when you book on Airbnb next time. I made a booking No. **. I purchased air tickets and packed my bags for next days travel - only to hear that the host has cancelled my booking. And Airbnb does not take any responsibility to provide me alternative booking. Since it is the last minute - now they are demanding me to shell out 300% MORE so that I can get similar property. It is such a huge disappointment that I never expected from Airbnb. They charge you 20% booking fee, but when things don't go right, they just wash off their hands blaming the host. Come on, do we book with Airbnb because we know the host prior to booking?",2,"Ramesh of Taguig, Other"
723,"SHAME ON AIRBNB. SHAME ON AIRBNB. I tried very hard to get help less than 24 hours after I had booked a room and wanted to change due to lack of trust of the host. Airbnb made no effort to make things right for me. You have NO advocate with Airbnb if things go bad... I had until now booked with them with a false sense of security that their customer service would handle things fairly if needed, however my experience with Maria at Airbnb was proof that they put ill educated and poorly trained people in charge of handling (if you call it that!) issues.",2,"Ma of Calabasas, CA"
724,"I have been a host on Airbnb for over 3 years and submitted my first report because a guest booked with me for two nights and upon their departure it was discovered they set up a screen printing business in my home for the two days they stayed and damaged my sofa, linens, glass top of coffee table and bathtub. I followed Airbnb guidelines and contacted a representative at their Help number, which took all of my information and the specifics revolving around the incident and damages. The rep said she would email me a form that I needed to fill out to report such damages to my property. 24 hours later I called the Help number again because I had not received the form as promised and a new rep said there were no notes in their system of my incident report.

So we rated our trips with one and two stars with a note about its infestation of unwanted bed bugs. First response from Airbnb next day was: ""Reconsider your evaluation"". We did not do it- nothing to reconsider. Second day response from Airbnb: ""You are not in compliance with the rules therefore we cannot post your comments"". When we tried to response and include a photo of our bites we found out that we were blocked out from the system. Basically they want to hide any bad experience due to their future profits that are above all for them. So we cannot warn the future guests for this situation.",2,"Jerry of Chico, CA"
726,"My wife does not understand English very well and when I stepped in to question an unethical by an Airbnb ""professional"" he immediately said I was not on the account and he terminated the phone call.

Just a terrible representation of a business.",2,"Forrest of Bloomington, MN"
727,Airbnb is getting extremely unreliable. A few months ago my husband booked a place in Paris. It was canceled. He rebooked a place again and that one was cancelled less than 2 weeks before he was leaving. A few months ago I thought I would give it a try again and booked a house in Barcelona for a very reasonable price. Dec 19th I get a notice that the booking was canceled. Another friend of mine told me something similar happened to her in Madrid.,2,"Rose of Nyc, NY"
728,"My family and I booked an apartment in Catania, Sicily for two nights. After one night, we were forced to leave because the smell of natural gas and mildew permeated the apartment leaving us all feeling nauseous. We first addressed our concerns with the owner, who seemed to think we should just keep the main doors open (keep in mind, the doors faced a street with heavy traffic). We then addressed our concerns with Airbnb customer service and finally submitted a detailed review to notify other Airbnb users of our disturbing experience in hopes that the owner would rectify the situation for all future guests. This was one week ago. ",2,"Jayme of St Louis, MO"
729,I made the following complaint to Airbnb about a fraudulent listing of a two bedroom apartment and they denied my complaint... there is no standard as to what someone can list a room as a bedroom: BEWARE!!! I have one simple question: What standard does AIRBNB use when allowing owners of properties to define a room as a BEDROOM? Is it the IBC (International Building Code) The ICC (International Construction Code) The IRC (International Residential Code)? OR Do you just take the owners word for it without any defined standard?,2,"Robert of Camarillo, CA"
730,I want to love Airbnb. In 4 stays over 4 mos - average $100/night I found some very aggravating things hosts could easily fix. My suggestions: Check your cleaning service! 2 coffee pots were filthy - one impacted with moldy grounds - Clean often with white vinegar! 2 places had coffee pots - no filters. I'll bring coffee but the correct size filters provided by host would be nice. 1 had awesome espresso machine - that didnt work. Dust! Sneezed all night at a $100 guest house - in the AM I found the wall at the head of the bed was covered in dust! Under the bed same (Same place with moldy coffee pot).,2,"Susan of Gardnerville, NV"

I booked and ""Get Directions"" showed address as 1355 Flower Street just across from Convention Center.

732,"I found a condo, my card was charged, and immediately I get a response from the owner saying my dates were unavailable. I had just reserved and paid. So, my card was charged. Why? I had to request a refund which can take up to 5 days to go back to my card. Luckily we have plenty of funds. However, what about people who can't afford to book another place without that money? This is a scam. Should not trust your card with these people. Hopefully the refund will show up and we don't have to go through a dispute process. I will not book with Airbnb again.",2,"Dusty of Joplin, MO"
733,I booked an Airbnb home from host S.F. Maple in Jupiter Fl. After full payment they canceled our reservation a week prior to our stay with no explanation.

736,"We were looking forward to a trip to the TN Smoky Mountains and thought renting a cabin would be a great way to ""get-away"" from the crowds. Well the picture of the cabin we chose was really cute and it looked so nice that I booked it for 3 days. When we got to the cabin it was NOT what it seemed on the Airbnb site and not what it was described as being. The cabin was only about 100 feet off a country road with 2 other cabins right in front of it. The people in the both of the front cabins looked like they owned their cabins and the front cabin had parking right up to the front of our cabin. There was no ""mountain views"" and the people in the front cabin made noise up to 10 pm. ",2,"KC of Cocoa, FL"
737,I was having a major issue verifying my payment option which lead to a delay in my reservation. I had no other options and hadn't heard back from the host. I spoke with James ** who remained on the line while navigated the system and waited for a response from the host. He then offered to contact host in a attempt to make sure I booked the location time and price I wanted. James ** went over and beyond and was literally a guardian angel and prevented me from being on the streets that night. After speaking with him I was immediately verified and booked at my chosen destination. Thank you James ** for understanding the importance and urgency of my booking.,2,"S. t. of Long Beach, CA"

739,"We rented a Condo in Colorado for 3 nights. Katie is the host (probably the owner). We paid around $544 dollars and it was including some ""extra fees"" and a $100 cleaning fee. When we got there, it was a clean place, quiet, and nice. She had food (pretty much cans) and everything we needed. The only thing we used from her few food items was some pancake flour. THAT was it! According to the rules on the website there was NO charge for extra people, $100 cleaning fee, and check out time was Monday at 11:00 am. This woman sent me an email every day (which was extremely annoying) and on Sunday asked what time was I leaving so she could send her cleaning people. ",2,"Marissa of Oklahoma City, OK"
740,I went to NYC this summer through a private room that I booked in Manhattan for a really good deal. I had been traveling from Penn station to the apartment since it was relatively close by foot so I walked. I had been contacting the host all day but I had no answer. And I even messaged her the days before and nothing. I arrive to the location and still I have not received any information from the host as to what apartment number. This was my first experience with Airbnb in NYC and I am 18 years old in this city. I contacted Airbnb after two hours of no contact with the hostess. She had read my texts but no answers.

742,"I contacted the host to ensure I did not have a reservation within 24 hours of my inquiry. The reason why is the site said his place was inactive. He responded that he did not receive my request and noted he was booked in the same email exchange. Days before my trip, I received an inmail noting I was booked with him. I responded and reminded him of our previous conversation only to be told no, I was wrong. I have a long string of emails to prove I am right.

Yes, the rent was low but so was the quality. My first experience in an ""urban"" location turned out to be a room in an very inconvenient location where I was kept awake most of the night by barking dogs and then awoken in the early morning by roosters! The bathroom was pretty dirty. Fortunately, I was only staying there one night so I held my tongue and coped. On the next two trips which were longer, I found dirty rooms full of mosquitoes, no hot water to shower and no air conditioning even though it was listed as an amenity.

761,I booked at house in February and needed to cancel in March for a stay in August. The refund policy is very misleading. Cancel within 48 hours of booking and 14 days before check in to get full refund. Cancel up to 7 days before check in and get a 50 percent refund minus service charge. Cancel within 7 days of your trip and the reservation is non refundable. The host tells you they think you get back the amount. Airbnb tell you different. Service charges taken. Out of $393.28 I’m getting back $8.22 cents. ,3,"Sally of Calgary, AB"
762,"I canceled a reservation 60 days prior to a house with Strict cancellation policy. Guess what, I still have to refund from the host for money. The host told me that my cancellation excuse is ""lame"", and she has the right to decide not to refund my money. How ridiculous? What is the point with a definition of Strict cancellation policy? On AirBnb web page, it sad that ""cancellation before 14 days will get full refund except service fee"". AirBnb is getting worse and worse each year. I won't use it again.",3,"Zoe of Davis, CA"
763,"My first and only experience was horrible. I booked a house and made a down payment in January for a trip in March. There was an issue with payment because of my account being hacked into. They canceled my reservation without informing me that they were doing so. When I realized this days before our trip, I called and received the worst customer service in my life, specifically from Raven. They claimed that they emailed me to let me know but I never received it. They said I did not verify my email and that’s why. How were they able to take almost $400 from me if I hadn’t verified my email? ",3,"Tabatha of Saint Petersburg, FL"
764,Whatever you do don't book Airbnb. They cancelled my trip the day before and said I was locked out for security issues out of the blue the day before. I wish I read the reviews first. I now not only have to find a place for myself but my whole crew.,3,"Joseph of Myrtle Beach, SC"
765,"My first experience with Airbnb was one of a bait and switch tactic. Instead of a hotel, I decided to stay in an apartment. The rate was $201 per night. During the booking process, the rate increased to $250 per night. Luckily, I double checked everything before submitting payment. I ended up booking the reservation through another well known website for the original price of $201 per night, plus I saved a little due to the booking fees being lower. Since, I've received multiple emails from Airbnb encouraging me to complete the booking even though it's no longer available. I'm very disappointed and don't understand why companies participate in such unethical practices.",3,"Dawn of Birmingham, AL"
766,"After months of struggling with Airbnb...I gave up and then easily booked my vacation at VRBO! No more shock and disappointment discovering the difference between Airbnb’s hosts’ posted and actual price of rentals! No more delayed, confusing communications from hosts’ reneging on pricing and rental availability! And perhaps best of all no more suffering through Airbnb’s so called customer reps insisting that hosts are too busy to post accurate information and renters just need to waste as much time as it takes trying to get accurate rental info or who arbitrarily cancel an Airbnb customer’s account because the customer objects to such a woefully lacking customer service model.

767,"This is my first time using Airbnb to book my vacation. Me and my sister two family of 8 people planning a 6 nights trips in Las Vegas for the spring break. I had made a reservation through Airbnb on December 28 2018, for apartment in downtown Las Vegas from April 13th to April 19th 2019. 5 days later, my sister told me, she doesn’t want to go on the road trip no more, cause there are too much driving for her. So I hurry up and canceled the reservation, but they said the cancellation policy is very strict, you may cancel the reservation within 48 hours and 14 days before check in to get a full refund. It is very tricky, I canceled my reservation 100 days before I check in but they still charged me 50 percent of my deposit which is $468.75.

769,"Airbnb.com says that you can cancel a booking and get full refund, or free of charge, if you cancel your booking before 48 hours, or within 48 hours of booking. Well, I am trying to cancel a 28 day booking I made in Budapest, but I am starting to get a really bad feeling about this host. I am afraid this host might be a scam, and I didn't want to risk getting to a faraway land in a country I’ve never been before, and risk not being able to get in the apartment with a child. I changed my mind and I was thinking to stay in another city instead, but since I paid $792.00 I wanted to get a refund so I could use it for another booking in another city. But airbnb.com website is telling me that my full refund (in less than 48 hours of booking) will be only $64.00. This company airbnb.com is a scam. Please be aware.",3,"Alexandra of Issaquah, WA"

773,Recently rented a place and the owner kept my deposit saying that we scratched his fridge door yet we are positive it was his cleaner. He charged us $300 for a scratch and AirBNB allowed him to do this even though he never repaired the scratch. He got a fake quote and they allowed it. I have only gotten great reviews and am always very careful. AirBNB refused to keep open communication with me and immediately charged my credit card.,3,"Rhonda of Honolulu, HI"

775,"I had booked a condo in the middle of June for a December vacation. My wife and I were already in Huatulco when the host cancelled on us two days prior to moving into the condo. Airbnb gave me a $92.00 credit to put towards another property. With only two days before we required a place to stay I booked another property which ended up being 6 times the original booking. I have read and re-read their policies on Host cancellations and have been going back and forth with Airbnb to get this resolved. I am going on three months now and they keep putting it to a different customer care department. I have copied all my correspondences with them and have shown them their own policies in regards to a Host cancellation. Just wish that they would come forward and say, ""Sorry we were wrong and here is your refund."" For a company that brags about its platform being built on trust they certainly don't follow through.",3,David of Other

He gave me no resolution so I contacted Airbnb to request my refund and I did it within their 24 hour time frame as stated on the refund policy. It took them 11 days and they have denied my refund request and now they have blocked my ability to contact the host or them.

I don't understand how they cancel my reservations hours before arrival then trick me into another reservation under false pretenses. Double cross me twice then expect me to trust them not to cancel on me again? Why? If I am too ** for your LA reservation I should be too ** for your Las Vegas reservation.

I'm only giving it an extra star because of the nice customer service handling the problem and refunding my money, otherwise I'd give it one star. I don't think I will use this service again.

While doing so our reservation was canceled and we were only offered a partial refund. I contacted the host about refunding the rest and he offered me a bogus special that was for $199 per night.

I have confirmed with letter from the bank that account is closed, and that there is no chargeback request for the charge, at which point I was directed to provide a new card for refund process.

So not only is the $400 dollar gift card stuck (we can't sell it or get rid of it) we have to use on another trip using AIRBNB which will be the very last time we use them.

795,"Last summer 2018 I had an Airbnb guest for over two months at my apartment. Knowing it was going to be a long stay, I called Airbnb prior, to let them know I was concerned about the utilities being included in the price. Utilities are paid per use and it is hard to anticipate what the guest will be using, mainly in summer with AC units. Airbnb told me not to worry because I would be covered by their standard agreement. After the guest had left, I received the electrical bill and it was 3 times more than what I had anticipated. I brought it up to Airbnb and the only thing they had to say was they are sorry but the security deposit can not be applied to utilities. Utilities are always included in the price. How are we supposed to estimate the electrical use for extended stays? It does not feel fair to estimate a really high number and make some people overpay.",3,"Yolanda of New York, NY"

802,The matter first began when Airbnb froze payment on my account. I opened a simple ticket to inquire why. First Airbnb said I had to fill out a US tax account form. This was false as I am in Canada. I spent time and money trying to resolve the matter based on this false advice. Next Airbnb said I needed to become a business and provide my business details. Again I investigated. This was also false. Lastly it was a simple matter unrelated to what Airbnb support told me.

They made many accusations and told many lies in this review. I asked Airbnb to take it down since it was clear that they were was seeking justice for losing their deposit.

In an attempt to conceal the damages, the guest wrapped the soiled sheets in clean towels, turned the pillow cases inside out, and ""made the bed"" with the soiled duvet. Upon check out, the house rules convey guests need to report any damages (not once has a guest stepped up for obvious damage) among other things that need to be tended to, like locking up. Guest did not lock the door and so I had to send someone over to lock up. Had the guest revealed what had happened, steps of sanitation would have been implemented.",3,"James of San Diego, CA"
817,"My wife and I rented an Airbnb in Stavanger, Norway. The place literally made us both ill. There were rats, mold in the walls, mold in the wooden floor, furniture destroyed, appliances broken, no vacuum cleaner, bathroom illegally installed so rats had direct access to the unit, no lock on the entrance door. When we made Airbnb aware of the place we told them that we had both developed respiratory problems and headaches their reply was that this is not sufficient for a refund!!!",3,Michael of Norway
818,"I had a situation where I rented a house under specific ""house Rules"" and ""Security Deposit Amt."" The agreement was made ~2 months prior to rental. ~2.5 weeks prior to our rental date the owner changed the ""house rules,"" notifying us that there would be surveillance cameras inside the house and the security deposit was changed from $2000 to $3000. I had full documentation of the original terms of the rental agreement as well as the changes made. AirBNB customer service reps (located outside of the U.S.) neither understood Airbnb's own policies nor did they care about the violation of the renter. I tried speaking with reps from within the U.S. The company is extremely chaotic. Could never speak with same reps twice. It was a nightmare. I lost $1260.00. I WILL NEVER USE AIRBNB'S SERVICE AGAIN SO LONG AS I RESIDE ON THIS EARTH SO HELP ME GOD! They are a sham!",3,"Patrick of Sayville, NY"
819,"I’ve been hosting using Airbnb the last couple months and find the app and company policies to be quite unfair for us hosts. For example, anytime someone has an inquiry/question you as a host must pre-approve them staying with you in order to avoid penalties. I have had several guests ask to park at my place for up to 3 weeks while they travel & only book 1 night at my place. ",3,"M of City,City"
820,"Fist of all Airbnb did not follow their company refund policy to issue my refund. Second of all, the case manager erased all the communication record between me and her in my personal profile of Airbnb!!!! Third of all, Airbnb case manager refuse to post my review to the host SPI Rental South Padre Island which steals $1556.17 from me without providing a safe environment and created lots of issues which qualified for the refund to customers based on Airbnb refund policy. I spent two horrible night there and was charged for $1556.17. Airbnb helps those treating and disgusting host to fool customers to rent from Airbnb. Airbnb prevented a customer to review the terrible host and just put the good review for the terrible to help them fool people and make their commission fee!!!",3,"Emily of Pearland, TX"
821,"We rented a condo a month ahead of time. When we arrived, the lockbox code did not work. We called the host... Long voicemail saying he was out of town... Voice mailbox was full. Left text for host... no response after an hour. Called Airbnb... was on hold for 50 minutes. Agent said he would try to call host. Agent called back in 15 minutes saying that the host had finally answered but had then hung up on the agent! The agent canceled our reservation on the spot and said the host has the right to cancel at any time!! This is not the first time an Airbnb host has canceled at the last minute. I find that VRBO and HomeAway are much more professional and reliable and will continue to use them in the future.",3,"Jill of Greenville, SC"
822,"I am saddened to share my terrible experience with the Airbnb hosts. I have never ever in my entire life of traveling experience such terrible people.

My greatest unpleasant surprise was to find out that the first host has no house available for me and my family,",3,"akhona of Other, OTHER"
823,So Airbnb likes to ** with people too much. I normally don’t care to write reviews but I’ve had too much trouble with Airbnb and I just want everyone to know that they are the worst company. Let me tell you how. Bear with me because this is a long issue I’m about to complain about. In 2017 around June or July a friend and I took a trip to California. On the way to California about 2 hours out our Airbnb was cancelled. We felt with Airbnb for a long time and had a huge issue with customer service so we were told we would receive a credit for our next stay. Now this is a whole issue I’m not about to get into because it has nothing to do with this current issue but I want you to know before I took my trip on 11/14/2018 I called Airbnb since I never received credit from my trip in 2017. I called and they gave me 100$ credit FOR MY TROUBLES in 2017. Keep that in mind.,3,"Naturally of Scottsdale, AZ"
824,"We recently rented an apartment in Barcelona Spain, and the experience wasn't good at all, neither the support from Airbnb. The apartment was dirty, no sheets, no towels and the AC did not work. It is really frustrated and unfortunate for most customers as I went through the reviews here. Airbnb seems to care only about the money from the host and they take the side of the host, no matter what they say, I realize that they can say anything, and that is really troubling, not fair and not right at all, and gives you with a bad taste and awful experience that makes you question choosing Airbnb again.",3,"Belinda of Oviedo, FL"
825,"Airbnb warning. Just a warning that not all hosts are honest. I recently booked a home in Isla Mujeres in Mexico for the month of February and luckily enough was in Mexico in December and took a day out of my vacation to check out the rental. We hired a local cab driver to help us find the property. We not only never found the house but the street it was supposed to be on was in a slum and garbage lined the streets, bars on all the windows, nothing even close to the picture on the Airbnb listing. ",3,Antje of Canada
826,"If you are looking for renting a property through this booking site please read carefully and be aware. Hidden fees - The prices listed seem to be lower compared to some hotels, but that is misleading. Once you get to the check out you all of sudden notice that 1. They charge you booking fee for every day you book - that seems to be % of your booking so it can add up to $80-$100 extra. 2. Many hosts will charge you cleaning fee $30-$35. 3. Many hosts will want you to also pay for electricity and water. 4. Add to that you get no daily service. 5. No free breakfast. 6. No airport shuttle. 7. No 24 hrs front desk service since the host lives usually quite far or in different country. All added up you pay a lot more for the booking than in the hotel.",3,"Michael of Columbia, SC"
827,I have used AirBnB quite often and never had a complaint. This time the apartment we rented was not owned or rented by the host who listed it on the site. Someone else was occupying it. Seems it was a fraud case. While I had no issues with the AirBnB agent who was forthcoming and supportive it took us nearly two hours to get someone on the phone or chat. All three travelers were trying to contact AirBnB by phone and chat. Every time the system or someone (?) hung up after 40 to 60 minutes of listening to that awful music. Basically if you have a problem you are on your own. After nearly two hours we finally got someone on the line who authorized us to take a hotel which would be reimbursed. I hope that works.,3,"Udo of Denver, CO"
828,"I recently stayed at a room in a private home, with a shared bathroom and the experience wasn't good at all, neither the support from Airbnb, and it is really frustrated and unfortunate for most customers as I went through the reviews here.

829,"The experience overall was good as a host, But I do have an issue with not being informed/alerted that I had to provide an identity to withdraw the money! It's basically hidden info on the site while it should be very clear to me before I proceed to have a guest in my house. It's been a few months and the guest is gone and I still can't receive my money (That I started the whole thing because I was in need of it at that time), I can't do that because I don't own a passport and that's the only option they gave me to prove my identity so they made it even harder for me! That's an issue or that's what I think is an issue.",3,"Moustafa of Other, OTHER"

831,"An Airbnb host cancels unexpected two days prior to the check-in date for a family New Year's celebration. When ""working"" for over four hours with the Airbnb Customer Service, all of whom are shocked that the limited comps are so expensive so close to a major holiday. Airbnb provided poor alternatives for a family trip, stating that other options were too expensive. Their solution was to receive a partial reimbursement after the fact. Not to mention this was after four LONG phone calls and four hours of nothingness. I expected more. My fault for assuming anything good from Airbnb.",3,"Sean of Saint Louis, MO"
832,"I stayed in an Airbnb in this Nov 2018 for 16 days in a house in Canada, Toronto, Pintail Cres. The host entered my room without permission 3 times, or more. The host's wife, Olxa, informed me at night that the host Darxn was in my room to unplug my MP3 Player. There is no advanced notification for permission to enter my room. On the second last day of my stay, when I came back at night, I found a gift paper wrapped cookie on my desk. Nobody asked for permission to enter the room or notified me after the entering up to this Dec 22, 2018. My concern is that that day I was rushed out for training and forgot to lock my luggage which has my passport, ID cards, credit cards etc important personal info.",3,"Candie of San Jose, CA"
833,"I have been using Airbnb since 2016. Every time I encountered a problem, Airbnb takes the side of the host irrespective of the circumstances. They also hide or delete bad reviews at the request by the host. My recent experience was, I arrived at this house to find out the place is dirty and had cutlery with food particles on them. The floor infested with ants and there were a few flies, those large ones that appear during summer, in the house. The house was facing the host's backyard and the place was a mess. Due to these shortcomings I immediately notified Airbnb after attempting to contact the host. The Airbnb contacted the host. When the host arrived at the property, they were visibly upset and appeared aggressive. They tried to pick an argument which I tried hard to avoid, which made me really uncomfortable and felt threatened at the time. I was alone at their property and anything could happen when someone is upset.",3,Upul of Australia
834,They advertise that you can get a refund within 14 days before check-in. Please read the fine print because they don't. They have you pay for half the duration e.g 5 days if you will stay for 10 days. If you cancel after 38 hours but within the 14 days you get nothing back and they still advertise for the days you have paid for that you didn't get a refund. Talk about double payment.,3,Fibi of Other
835,"We have a trip planned in a week and just received a text cancelling our rental. They offer to refund our money, but getting something in a strange place with one week's notice is not easy. Not only are places more expensive with such short notice, we cannot get a great place for our vacation and have to settle for whatever we can get. Such a disappointment. How is this acceptable when we rented the place two months ago. No apology or explanation. I WILL NEVER TRUST THIS SERVICE AGAIN.",3,"Deborah of Reno, NV"
836,"We had booked a cabin for 12/28/2018-12/30/2018. Just two weeks before our trip, the host calls that the cabin isn’t available anymore due to the owners selling it, and not giving a 60 day notice. Just two weeks before my family arrives from Florida expecting a cabin, and in the busiest day of the year. There were no other selections in our price range so we don’t get any other cabin for that date due to the others being more expensive. Instead we get a measly credit of $101 for another booking, yet there are none left. This ruined our trip, especially since my family has been going through a hard time lately, and me and my wife wanted to treat them to a relaxing getaway. ",3,"M. of Dayton, TN"
837,I was visiting Lima Peru and booked a 1 bedroom apartment through Airbnb. (I have used my account with Airbnb in the past without any issue.) Upon arrival I was handed the keys from the landlord. She immediately explained the apartment wasn’t ready at the moment which was fine because I wasn’t going to be returning until The evening So I took the keys and left. I returned around 7 pm with my belongings and noticed the apartment was dirty particularly the bathroom since it clearly showed signs that it hadn’t been cleaned. There was a half used soap in the soap holder of the shower and a very dirty white rug to put your feet on after a shower. There was also no hand soap at all by the sink and there was one hand towel that was moist as if it had already been used. ,3,"Sandra of Hallandale, FL"
838,The assigned case manager hasn't contacted me for almost 24 hours on a time sensitive issue! They only care about making money and they usually side with the host.

I've been waiting since about December 2016 for a response on why my account was disabled. I've emailed & called them several times over the wait. They just sent a response December 2018. (TWO YEARS LATER!) Companies love throwing their 'terms of service' at you & telling you what they're not liable for when they are being **. Simply to remind you that they don't care about your frustrations & they are not there for you. ** AIRBNB!,3,"Ian of Brooklyn, NY"

On 8th December after the Paris violent protests, we asked for a cancellation and requested to change our booking to a safer location on 29 Dec. The roads to Ave Macmahon were blocked and metros around there were closed on 8 Dec. Tear gas and water cannons were fired right outside this apartment! After 3 days of email and multiple phone calls Airbnb has denied us a change even though we highlighted that it was unsafe especially for the kids. On their Airbnb website they have listed violence, inaccessibility and safety hazard as conditions for refund. Shouldn't they honor it? Their reply is, ""The host has refused a refund!""",3,Lim of Singapore
842,"They're a worst. I booked a trip like 5 days ahead. I wanted to cancel it the next day, which is still within 48 hour, since my schedule changed. They won't give me full refund, only 50% of it; they said the cancellation has to be within 48 hours AND 14 days ahead. How stupid is that? How can I have 14 days notice if I just book a room for a trip next week? They told me to go talk to the host as they can't do anything. I wish they're out of business soon. Heard they said they would go public, pray lord. The most irresponsible business model in the world. Use Booking.com instead. They help you cancel full refund even though it's not stated when you booked.",3,"Merry of Sugar Land, TX"

Capital One is trying to stick me with the full amount, even though Airbnb allows the host to not only insult guests that have stayed at her house, but also scam people with her rental, as there are numerous reviews stating that the host has roaches in her rental property. The fact that Airbnb allows this is beyond ridiculous, and Airbnb doesn't take care of its customers. They're in it for the host to rent locations to guests, sight unseen, fake pictures, fake reviews, unsafe locations, and unsanitary situations. Don't waste your money.

We checked in and we started seeing them everywhere!!! I contacted them and not only did they not move us but they only refunded $120 of the $950 we paid! We had to spend the trip in a cockroach infested place. I called, asked to speak to a manager and they did not care. They closed the case and told me it was my choice to stay there. I have used Airbnb for years and I cannot believe how they treated this situation.",3,"Sarah of Martinez, CA"
848,I booked a condo for a week in the Philippines and when we arrived to the condo it smelled like mold. The smell was really bad. I left immediately. Could not stay in an apartment that smelled so bad. I contacted Airbnb and asked for a refund. They were on the side of the host and only refunded me half. They did not protect me and were more on the side of the host. I posted a bad review about the host and it was never posted. There was no bad language used just being honest about my experience and it was not posted. No wonder the host has so many good reviews and no negative. I will not trust Airbnb anymore.

They declined to protect the host saying guest are free to say what they please so long as they aren't racist. I then explained I was not going to offer the guest money and instead provided Airbnb the plumber's note confirming the radiators were working and the house was above average hot, on top of which the guest had left windows open.

Just today, I wrote a bad review on Airbnb for an awful host and it was removed within the hour. I didn't break the guidelines, they didn't give me a valid reason for removing my review. I just guess that only good reviews sell. That is why I chose that host in the first place (all good reviews)… But if Airbnb removes the bad reviews, you have no way to know.

They did not want to reimburse us and they will not that the listing off, so beware when you plan your next vacation. They also edited your review and only post positive reviews.

Also the host showed up in our backyard in the dark with a flashlight unannounced during our stay and it made us feel extremely unsafe. So, there is the component of having a host that is dodgy. But the component that compelled me to write this review is the way Airbnb handled my concern. They sided with the host based on his rating overall rather than my individual experience. My experience was uniquely bad but because his reviews were ok from other guests my concern were not addressed and was minimized. There is no direct number to contact Airbnb and so all complaints are logged in an e-mail process. They called me back and that's when I got their number.

871,"Broken alarm system, smoke detectors missing, patchwork of leaks in ceiling unpainted, broken fridge, broken garage door, black grit in sink when water runs, balcony doors locked unable to sit out, filthy, old foods left in pantry. Sad experience for what we paid. Pictures available. Airbnb did not address my issues.",3,"Karan of Fort Worth, TX"
872,"I was looking to book a condo using Airbnb. This was my first time using their service. I wanted to make sure there were no other fees aside from the total shown during booking so I called the customer service number. I was reassured that there were no other fees to be collected as this was against Airbnb policy. I asked because I saw a mention of taxes were to be collected. I asked the same question and was given the same answer. This was around 11pm at night. The following day, the property manager called me about the taxes due. I called customer service and I was told I was to pay the taxes since it's listed on the website. Well, that's why I called prior to booking. ",3,"C of Houston, TX"
873,"with no excuse or reason why I have no payments like many others. They just tell me they are working on the problem, firstly they told me it was the Australian banking system so I call my bank and was told it was Airbnb changing their system with world pay. They just don’t seem to care.",3,Karleine of Australia
874,"Renters beware. Booking an Airbnb with Nina, Marais district, Paris France, was my first experience at booking an Airbnb, and consequently will be my only experience, booking anything through Airbnb. My trip was schedule and then Hurricane Irma hit (the largest hurricane to hit the state of Florida in history). Nina told me to reschedule but I had to contact her off Airbnb. (I later learned this was so she could still collect my payment and Airbnb would still get their kickback). She let me reschedule and then on the day I was supposed to fly out, she told me she double booked and that I would have to stay at a different location, for which she refused to disclose details.",3,"Sarah of Vero Beach, FL"
875,Beware booking with Airbnb far in advance of your trip. I just booked an apartment in Malta for a month in March and they charged me the full amount on Nov 7th rather than a deposit and the balance in February. When I phoned Customer Service there is of course nothing they can do. Just be careful when booking - make sure you are pre-approved for the rental then you will have the option of 2 payments.,3,Fred of Canada
876,"We booked a condo in Angel Fire, NM for 7 days over Christmas at a listed price of $168 per night. After our 50% deposit was accepted and our reservation confirmed the “Hosts” called me separately, emailed me and sent me a private message over Airbnb that they had accidentally posted the incorrect price and if we did not accept their “altered” price of $535 a night then they would cancel our reservation. Knowing they legally can’t make us pay for their mistake, the wife called me begging that we please cancel or they would not be able to make their mortgage. ",3,"Jennifer of Grand Prairie, TX"
877,"I and my wife rented a house in Lake Havasu for two weeks at a price of about $4,000.00. We were so eaten by bed bugs. We reported this to the owner and to Airbnb. We were told to take pictures to prove the bedbug. We took several pictures and sent them to the owner and Airbnb. We were told that the owner had supposedly taken care of the problem but my wife and my grandkids were bitten all over by the bed bugs. We were told that we should have reported it as soon as we got bit. We waited a couple of days to make sure what they were. We were offered a whole 10% off the rental rate. We will have bills for fixing our house and the houses of our children and their kids. I will never use this service again due to way we were treated. I highly encourage everyone not to use this service-ever!",3,"Dennis of Wilsonville, OR"
878,"I am and have been a Super Host with a Five star rating with Airbnb for over four years, I recently had a guest who came into my sparkling clean home and clog my toilet with his waste, he admitted to clogging the toilet and watching it drain onto the bathroom floor, and then he left my home for the day with no communication about the incident to me. When I came home later that day it was raining in my garage, the bathroom is right above the garage. He caused a lot of damage to my home and had the nerve to leave me a bad review. I contacted Airbnb support about the damage and the review, they put a case manager on my claim and his dishonest review, they will not support me as a host or remove the review.

879,"Not worth the bother or the money. I stayed in Copenhagen and was not at all satisfied with my room. I stayed in a basement where I couldn't lock the front door. The owner was not helpful at all, actually he was slightly hostile. And of course I didn't get some of the money back that I have paid. When I came home I was going to write a scathing review of this place but oh no. I had two weeks to do it they said, but after a few days it was too late. I contacted Airbnb about the review/deadline but that was like talking to a wall. It's extremely hard to get any response and when they finally answer they are of no help at all. Stay at a decent hotel or don't go at all is my suggestion.",3,Fred of Sweden
880,"I booked an apartment in Vancouver Canada through Airbnb and host charged me for the stay and also accept my reservation. I will get a notification from Host two days after that he wants to increase the price for 80% and I complain to Airbnb customer support about it (how would you let the host do this much increase after confirming my reservation). After a week, Airbnb did no do ANYTHING for me regarding this issue and they just cancel my reservation without any support. They let the host do whatever they want to the customers and they do not give any support to their customers. They even do not have any review system in their website after they cancel your reservation. Please share this with others so they know how Airbnb is acting in regard of customer service.",3,"Hesam of San Mateo, CA"
881,"I complained to Airbnb about cockroaches in my Toquerville, Utah, rental. The owner didn’t take accountability and Airbnb sides with her. They said they would only give me 1/2 of my money back, which I still have yet to see, because the roach photos I sent “didn’t prove an infestation."" What??? I didn’t realize a few cockroaches are a-ok when hosting tenants! (There were more than a few, but my pictures showed only several at once.)  Airbnb should be consumer-based, rather than siding with their hosts so much, judging by the other reviews. I’ll happily stay in hotels henceforth, as I KNOW a hotel would go above and beyond to make reparations for something as disgusting as this.",3,"Jessica of Clifton Park, NY"
882,"My friends booked an overnight stay in Brooklyn. I’ve never used Airbnb before. My friends, who are **, found this place in Brooklyn that was convenient and priced right. The owner was well rated, so there were no issues. I called him a week before the booking, to check on parking. We had two cars. I was concerned about on street parking. I asked if there was a lot nearby. He assured me that the neighborhood was safe and that we could get both our cars in his driveway. Ok, cool.",3,"Kim of Youngstown, OH"
883,So I moved provinces in Canada and before my son and I could settle down we booked into a *5 Star superhost* apartment in Toronto for 31 days. The pics were of a different apartment. The place was filthy dirty. The stove almost burnt us and the microwave was broken. The owner was out of the country and realized that he was renting the place and then *renting as an Airbnb* when he was away or staying at his girlfriend's. The owner of the place I mean my host's landlord one time stopped me and asked me what I was doing in his building. I explained to him and he almost kicked me out and I had already paid 1600$.,3,Jeri of Canada
884,"First and last time we use AIRBNB. The AC unit did not work in the apt, the beds had no linen, we received a nasty towel and the pillows had yellow stains all over and no pillow cases. We contacted the host and waited 24+ hours for an answer. We also contacted Airbnb, they were useless. The case manager was rude and did not offer any help other than to file a complain and to email pictures. We requested a refund and she denied our request. They took the word of the host over ours. Never again. STAY AWAY.",3,"Belinda of Oviedo, FL"
885,"Beware of Airbnb! We showed up to our “quaint” Victorian guest room in L.A.... 5 star ratings, great pics, and Airbnb “super host” do not mean much. Owner had us go through 3 security locks to get INTO the house only to find the back door wide open. Owners also did an oops and left the door to their hoarder room open, and then didn’t even have our room ready. I couldn’t get out quick enough and went to battle with Airbnb. They were difficult and wanted to charge 1/2 due to us “cancelling”. I insisted on sending pics to justify why we should get full refund. If I hadn’t taken pics, I’m sure I would have had to pay. After jumping through hoops, we got full refund.",3,"Lisa of Gilbert, AZ"
886,"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE! I used Airbnb for multiple years, multiple travel accommodations, I did not travel for 1 1/2 years, and stopped using Airbnb, I am now attempting to proceed with a booking and it's been 9 days since the initial booking request... With the same error message EVERY SINGLE time ""Oops, we're unable to complete this booking. Unable to perform action. Please try again through the website or contact support if you need immediate assistance."" I have called customer service EVERY SINGLE day, and NO ONE is documenting the issue, NO ONE is escalating the issue, NO ONE is telling me what the issue even is and why I can't even complete this booking. Multiple days and multiple hours on the phone with customer service, WASTED TIME and 9 days later, nothing is solved. TERRIBLE BUSINESS, TERRIBLE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH AIRBNB, go to VRBO or another reputable site.",3,"M of Santa Monica, CA"
887,"I booked a room knowing my travel situation could change, but the ad said full refund if cancellation prior to 24 hours before trip. I cancelled a month before the trip, and they kept $40 as a service fee. Nowhere was that made clear before I booked the room.

888,"I rented an apartment at **, On arrival I noticed 2 signs. One on the clothes dryer that said broken do not use and one on the dishwasher that said the same. Not a good start. I started to look around the apartment and had to take photos. 1. Carpet was filthy and stained. 2. Cooktop was absolutely filthy and not properly cleaned. 3. Griller door was broken and full of grease. 4. Countertops in kitchen were stained. 5. Walls were filthy, chipped and i=unclean. 6. Shower was absolutely filthy. Grouting had not been cleaned for months and was filthy.",3,"Ray of Australia, Other"
889,"The additional fees are a rip-off. In the end the total costs work out more expensive than staying at a good reliable hotel in more central location. Got charged $99 service fees and $60 cleaning fees on top of $600 accommodation fee for 4 nights stay in a small apartment in Shinjuku. When I found a good 3 star hotel with breakfast included at a more Tokyo central location, which is also part of Qantas travel program, I attempted cancelling the Airbnb reservation, only to find out that you could only do this on a computer not on your phone or iPad, and that the service fee is not refundable because it was already more than 48 hours when I made the booking. I felt extremely frustrated because it said nowhere when I made the booking that the service fee is non-refundable after 48 hours. Literally a ripoff and a scam. On a note bookings through Agoda or Booking.com are free, if hotels have free cancellation policies you get all your money back.",3,"Hannah of Cranbourne North, Other"
890,"I rented with my wife a "" luxury apartment "" off 5th Avenue, pay USD 850 per night for 9 nights. We checked in at 3 pm, and first thing we noticed was that the rug in the living room was seriously disgusting, red wine was spilled all over it, and it had cigarette burns. But really the worst was when we went to bed. After some minutes we realized the smell, and then it dawned on us that we were sleeping in very used sheets/bed covers/pillow cases. The next day we reported it to the owner, by Whatsapp, and he came and removed the rug, and attempted to change the linen, but he is a young lawyer, and had never changed a bed in his lifetime, so my wife ended up doing it.",3,christian of Argentina

I have screen prints that prove the discount did not exist and contacted Airbnb and let them know. One of their caseworkers admitted that there was a bug in the system and he reported to be fixed. I have a print screen of that conversation as well. I stopped hearing from him and the next person told me there was no bug and he misspoke and has been reprimanded.

892,"This company is the brand of highways robbers using and abusing people’s need in place to stay rung fully advertising about a place. The hosts are not that far behind with edited photos of their ** place called apartment, Airbnb is not a company but Rather bunch of drunken people with a junky’s appetite for people's money, these people simply should be out of Business not other way around, they don’t create anything but getting paid by hosts with the same distribution of junk than those who tuning the Airbnb.",3,"Bijan of Santa Monica, CA"
893,"Checked into an Airbnb in Lawndale, CA for 2 weeks. Immediately noticed the bathroom needed a thorough cleansing. No bowls in the cabinets, microwave filthy, etc. When I confronted the host I was told he had fired the maid and would be cleaning himself. No cleaning occurred despite the fact this was a shared bathroom and guests came and went. On a Sunday night, host had a party until 4 a.m. in which all the Airbnb guests stood in the hallway asking him to turn the music down. I moved out 1 week early and requested a full refund of unused days and supplied pictures of my issues. I was told by Airbnb that they would not be refunding me since I made the decision to leave on my own accord! I will never stay at an Airbnb again and am extremely disappointed with their customer service.",3,"Brenda of Dallas, TX"

Dead fish on the beach and unable to breathe on the beach. 2 days into the visit a mandatory evacuation was declared for our area. Airbnb and the owner refused any reimbursement. There are better companies out there to use - I would suggest doing so...,3,"Craig of Murfreesboro, TN"
895,"Airbnb pro host - No refunds whatsoever - no dispute resolution!!! Where do I begin - If I could leave no stars I would. Let's start with, we made the reservation at around 5pm. We told the host we would not be arriving until around midnight. He said no problem, just call when we got there and he would provide us a code to get in the door. When we arrived in Jersey City at midnight, I called Jason (the host) and got no answer. The neighborhood seems very sketchy. I had to call 5 or 6 times before he answered and gave us a code. We got into the place and it was about 95 degrees maybe more. There was no A/c in the apartment as described in the ad. There was 2 towels for 2 guys who were staying for 4 nights. There were no bowls, no plates and all these were mentioned in the amenities along with a coffee pot which did not exist.",3,"Glen of Andover, NY"

Our host canceled our reservation 1 hour prior to check-in to our NYC apartment rental. I was stranded in NYC with my 2 small children, on a Friday evening of a holiday weekend, with no place to stay, and no means of support other than my phone (with limited battery life).

We booked and on the day of check in we found the place to be unsuitable to stay with a foul smell and mold all over the home. We then found out the home was fumigated with poisons for rats, cockroaches and termites. The host wouldn't get refund us so we went to Airbnb to resolve our issue. We wrote to Airbnb and asked for their help to resolve our issue. They reached out to the host who refused to refund us even though we did not and could not stay in the home with the poisons.

899,"We reserved an Airbnb in Washington DC about 10 months before trip. While travelling, Airbnb cancelled our booking about 1 week prior to that visit... Reason? Because the house owner was not complying, with their rules... They were warned 3 times... Did not comply so were taken off the site. Instead of penalizing the apartment themselves they actually penalised us more as we are stuck with nowhere to stay. The American office then emailed us to give us other choices of accommodation then booked it for us. We are Canadian so unknowingly they booked it in US dollars without telling us. That was a natural mistake as the agent didn't even think of that. But for us it meant another 30% increase. Their office would not do anything, even was going to penalise us for cancelling. We will never use their service again.",3,"Stan of Kelowna, Canada"

I tried to get it to unlock and they asked for my ID photo. I sent it and then I got this horrible letter and now they won't respond back. How is it possible that they can block me when I have never even rented? I am not a criminal, nor have I ever been arrested or have even a parking ticket. I have a high powered career, am educated and have a family. ",3,"Sherri of Orange, CA"
901,"Terrible customer service. They say they'll call you back, but when they do, you'll still may wait on hold for 15+ minutes. Eventually, you'll get connected to a useless idiot in India who speaks in a fake American accent, has a fake American name, and doesn't listen to anything you say. They have a very poor interface with your local government, and when something goes wrong will not warn you in advance. Instead, they'll just cancel all your upcoming visitors. That'll BE your notice that something has gone wrong. You'll have to email your local government to find out what the actual problem is, because Airbnb's tech isn't good enough to determine the problem and convey it to you. ",3,"Joel of San Francisco, CA"
902,"I cancelled my booking 5 days after making the reservation and 3 weeks ahead of the reservation. My host was pleasant and offered a full refund if she could rebook, which she could. Airbnb charged me a service fee (although no service was provided) and despite their stated policy which reads: ""We may waive the cancellation fee, depending on how many times you’ve already canceled. After that, the following fee will be deducted from your first payout after a cancellation. The amount deducted will depend on when you accepted the reservation and how soon before check-in you canceled"". ",3,"Lisa of Greenwich, CT"
903,"The room was fine... Until we got kicked out of it because AirBnB double booked us, even though we paid through Monday. We got kicked out of our room on Sunday to accommodate the incoming guests. We sat in our truck for 6 hours waiting on Airbnb to resolve this issue, so our last day on our short vacation was ruined completely. Then to top it all off, Airbnb didn't help us out AT ALL. On a good note, Vacasa is going to reimburse us for having to pay for a hotel. I will never use Airbnb again! And I suggest to anyone booking with them to think again. I will only book with Vacasa from now on!",3,"Melody of Huntsville, AL"
904,"They are THIEVES! They blame the Host, but keep their portion of the fees. I am not unreasonable and understand the Cancellation Policy, but we had a Hurricane ruin wedding plans that involved an active Army Service member and they kept 50% (Thousands of Dollars) for nothing with months to go until the date. They are a website and nothing else. Many other Real Estate sites to choose from with the same properties that don't rob customers and then hide from their Customer Service responsibility. Absolute tragedy paying as much money as I did for literally nothing. Be careful with expensive booking... The fees are set on percentage and you could lose thousands for never even staying there after 48 hours even though the event was 4 months away. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!",3,"Lawrence of Raleigh, NC"
905,"As an Airbnb host, Airbnb completely let me down!!! When I rented my home to a customer, I never expected to come back home to a deserted party house. It was very obvious that the woman who stayed there over the weekend threw a party that got out of hand. We submitted pictures and invoices to Airbnb letting them know the damages and proof of what we paid in repairs. Airbnb declined to hold the woman accountable and/or help us to cover any of the costs themselves, with no explanation why. Since then, I’ve decided that the risk of allowing strangers to stay in my home is too risky when the company who is supposed to protect your home doesn't do the right thing. I encourage everyone to steer clear of Airbnb and find another source to rent out your home.",3,"Chris of Denver, CO"
906,"I booked a reservation over a month ago. 2-days before check-in, my Airbnb hosts says that they can't accommodate the booking anymore because they themselves have nowhere else to go???

907,"I've just finished up with more than 16 hours of customer support service and somehow we at no point were able to come to a resolution. I was fully made aware that your policy is to not help find listings for 3rd party bookings and was told several times that this was breaking protocol, but I did at this point let the staff know that I’d stay with my mom as well in order to void the seemingly insurmountable problem. Once we crossed this hurdle, I won't deny that your teams did try to assist us in finding listings we had already found on our own many times over (you have a very big staff, I may have spoken to more than half of them). I will admit that it would have been more helpful if the people helping us and looking at the maps happened to be familiar with the neighborhoods, the real life distances between them opposed to the perceived distances one sees on a map.",3,"Christina of Ridgewood, NY"

Week before the trip, contacted the owner and he said it was never for rent (at all, which makes no sense). Airbnb promised to rebook and would call me back with options. They never did. I had to call back multiple times. ""Someone will call you tomorrow"" - never did. I called back again (x3), ""I'll send you similar options in 15 minutes.""

Other guests during the same week are booking at $34.00 per night. I wrote this in my chat, AirBnB customer service response ""customers booking weekly or monthly stays are given a discount"". I again reiterated that these were 1-2 night stays. AirBnB responded that I had agreed to 10% discount for customers"".

Bank of America says Airbnb has to do a chargeback to retrieve the money and then refund to the correct card. Airbnb wrote that they DO NOT DO CHARGEBACKS. It is how their system is set up. They even put in writing that their system always uses the original card number no matter if it has been stolen, lost or cancelled. I am out my money.",3,"Kay of Oregon, WI"
911,"I am both a guest and host. For the most part Airbnb has been a good experience. However I have found they did not protect their hosts. I'm guessing maybe due to who pays them. I clearly offered a strict nonsmoking condo. My guest stayed 2-3 weeks and smoked inside the condo the entire time, to the point the cleaning crew went twice after their stay to try and remove the strong odor of cigarette smoke. In addition I had to change all filters, and clean any fabric, curtains, sofa, chairs, rugs, etc. that absorbed smoke. After the fact I found a cushion turned over on a chair with a cigarette burn in it. ",3,"Robert of Long Beach, CA"

First they dropped a number in my bank account which I noticed when the account wasn't showing a deposit, then they locked me out of making any changes to the account and told me they couldn't send the amount until I made the changes. I told them the changes had been made before I was locked out and the account is now set up and working. I have had no reply from them. The help person was no help at all and was saying sales speak with no meaning or relevance. I have found if you speak out they hold you to ransom. Poor service and a pack of thieves.

913,"I rented a cabin near Evergreen Colorado over Labor Day week. The host did not have an honest description of the property. The property did not have a driveway and you were forced to park on the side of a mountain, also the road that lead to the property was a freshly grated dirt road on a steep incline. When we contacted the site about this issue and how unsafe it was they did nothing about it. The host refused to refund any of the money even though we did not stay at cabin. I asked the site to look into this and they choose not to listen to me. The host called me a liar and said that any vehicle could make it to the location. I am out over $700 with no help from the site. It took them over 2 weeks to respond to my claim. The initial email that they sent me said that they would have it resolved in 72 hours.

Six weeks later after two requests from me for information I got another denial. I was not given a chance to make a case for my appeal. I have asked for an independent review. My plan for next steps is to make a complaint to the California Attorney General's office. This is something all complainants can do. Don't waste your time with customer service.

Although that's not what the steps of cancellation showed me on the website. Instead of €946,71 (total paid) - €133,96 (fee) it showed €421,39. Therefore I called Airbnb and by the first conversation the attendant wasn't helpful at all, he didn't know what to answer then he put the call on hold for several minutes. In the end he said ""you should be fine"" & that he would set the system to refund me the full price I paid (€946,71) minus the fee (€133,96), which I agreed.

I keep asking them to take it down but no, the same robotic answer, ""It doesn't violate our policies."" They are impossible to get in touch with, you can't call them only they can call you.

Yes I knew was 14 days after but had no clue was the time of checkout.

After the stay ended, I contacted Airbnb and they basically said that they never agreed to anything at all despite the apartment was in violation of safety and cleanliness Airbnb policies.",3,"Jason of Chestnut Hill, MA"
920,"Airbnb is a terrible customer service experience. They told my guest they will refund them without my permission. They had the guest occupy the space, agreed to the guest’s unreasonable request to get refunded and forcibly took money from my account. What did guest bring as an excuse? That the place wasn’t empty of my personal belongings. Like ** grow up and know this is a house not a hotel. Take your cheap ** to the hotel. Airbnb customer care is pure ** people with no appreciation that they are making money out of other people property. They believe they are obligated to issue refund and it is all at the cost of the host. I certainly like to sue them for this and love to get advice on how to do so. Customer care never responds and always promises to call you back but never does.",3,"Hami of Chicago, IL"
921,Refused to re-issue a refund to updated payment method. Refund is in limbo from the merchant to the bank ping-ponging back-and-forth and Airbnb refused to put the refund on the new payment method or mail us a check. They left in my face and refused to let me speak to a supervisor.,3,"Andrea of Palm Bay, FL"
922,"Posted your letter along with my response to our Facebook account and to our FOX NEWS affiliates in D.C. Our hope is that tens of thousands of Airbnb users will be as enraged by your flagrant violation and use of personal information as we are. Needless to say, it is doubtful we'll never hear from you. After all, we are the Deplorables and you are the all knowing, the elitists... called to correct our ignorant ways.",3,"Rob of Tampa, FL"
923,Just saw a story on the local news where Airbnb double booked another family. Thought I would share my story. They did the same thing to me back in Colorado this past June 2018. Never bothered to tell me the house had been double booked. Only way I found out was I saw credit on my credit card statement and I called. Neither Airbnb or host bothered to call and tell me. I had one month to scramble to try to find another house that accepted 2 dogs and everything was booked. I finally found one. No thanks to Airbnb and all they offered was $25 off. This company sucks and I will never do business with them again.,3,"Tanya of Bay City, TX"
924,"I signed up to be a host -- had to cancel (in plenty of time) due to extenuating circumstances. The guest was fine with it. Airbnb charged me $100, and it was totally unclear when I canceled that this charge would later be levied. This is a very shady company and I would recommend not doing business with them.",3,"Cal of Syracuse, NY"
925,"Absolutely the WORST company I've ever dealt with. When our host kicked us out for even daring to call Airbnb due to discrepancies in his listing, as well as having his wife verbally harass and threaten us, Airbnb did absolutely nothing. Completely unhelpful. They did give us a refund and an extra $40 but, at that point, everything in the area was booked or was 300+ a night. They didn't help us find another place to stay, leaving us without a home in Vancouver (we had to sit at the airport for 5 hours, refreshing the page to find another host), and only made matters worse by deciding to contact the wife AFTER we had expressed our concern for our safety. ",3,"Rebekah of Boise, ID"
926,"After staying at the Airbnb quite frequently while I was still looking for a permanent place in the new place I have moved to I started noticing that they will do ""anything"" to keep their business going. 1. They are not allowing any guest to stay continuously in a best ranked homes so that their service fee will add up. 2. They are not checking or validating the safety of the homes and they claim that they are not responsible for any unsafe condition of the homes in the listing. ",3,"Anitha of Charlotte, NC"
927,"My family and I with three kids aged between 1 and 8 years arrived to this ""resort"" yesterday. Immediately we noticed how ruined down the place was. Nothing like the pictures. We decided to walk around and see the rest of the facilities, the family pool in particular breaks any health and safety regulation, I have never seen anything like this before. So, the pool is located next to a drop of at least 50 meters, the edge of the pool (where your kids are meant to walk while playing) has nothing dividing the edge and the pool. If anyone falls into that drop someone will get seriously hurt. Having seen this we decided not to stay.",3,"Jorge of Great Britain, Other"
928,"When arriving at the Airbnb in London, the room was still not cleaned at the check in time. I let the owner know and he said the maid said it was cleaned but I was there and it was not; towels on the floor, bed with dirty linens, completely not cleaned. 30 min. Later still no maid and no clean room, so I left letting the owner know I was leaving not to return. I did not receive a complete refund because they say I didn't cancel and I didn't have proof of the dirty room. This was my first attempt with Airbnb and my last.",3,"Laura of Charlottesville, VA"
929,"We had booked a place to stay but had to cancel within 24 hours of making the booking because a few guests that were coming with us had to pull out. The terms and conditions stated we would be given a full refund in circumstances where bookings were cancelled within 48 hours. It has been four weeks later, four phone calls to Airbnb's customer service and several attempts to contact them on their feedback page but without luck. We are getting increasingly frustrated that the deposit has not been refunded, but what is worse is that the staff at Airbnb don't care. Terrible terrible terrible! Will never use again and advise you to do the same.",3,Steven of Australia
930,I spent a lot of time finding and booking a condo. The host asked a silly question that I did not immediately respond to because I was busy. The host canceled my reservation because I did not immediately respond to his stupid question.,3,"Nancy of Golden, CO"
931,"We have used Airbnb a lot in the past, but this time it was disgusting. Often, Airbnb rentals can be good - but more frequently than it should be, the rentals are not clean. In this case the sheets smelled, and there was visible hair - from the previous renter. We came in late, and Italy was having a heat wave; previously, my wife had gotten heat stroke, so we were just exhausted. So we did not report it to Airbnb right away. Since we waited, Airbnb refuses to help us. Kim, in their customer support department, is not sympathetic at all.",3,"Kevin of Campbell, CA"
932,"I referred another host to Airbnb before I had sufficient experience with their customer disservice department. I was promised in writing a $300 referral fee. This promise appeared on my referral page. All of the customer service people have stated that I am either an idiot or a liar and that this was only a progress bar. The notification on my page said you will receive your money in 15 business days not that my money was pending. Then after complaining to a customer service rep who denied I was entitled to the money I received an email saying, ""Don't lose hope refer another host to get a referral fee."" Having been defrauded one time why would I try it again? There is no way to directly contact the actual department that handles problems.",3,"Erica of Brooklyn, NY"
933,"I booked a room on Airbnb in Brooks, Maine. It said a ""loft"" on a farm. What I found was a dilapidated run down farmhouse with an attic space. A broken down fridge on the back porch, a door with a missing window pane and a filthy kitchen with piles of clothes. The room was almost 90 degrees so I turned on the a/c that was in the room. It blew out cold in front and hot in the back. It was a sauna. So I call Airbnb after speaking to our nonexistent hosts. What did I get - ""Well you should have taken pics."" I said it was 9 pm and I took pics of the room temperature and how the ""loft"" had no privacy door - forget a lock. ",3,"Graciela of Jackson, WY"
934,I had to cancel my vacation and no longer will need Airbnb accommodations. I canceled within the 48 hrs of cancellation policy and the host is refusing to give me a full refund. The host is not honoring the 48 hrs cancellation and full refund policy.,3,"Maris of Boca Raton, FL"
935,"We rented a home in an area near Omaha Nebraska. It looked very nice. The basement was storage and off limits. No problem, we paid hundreds of dollars for four nights and yay! In the first ten minutes we figure out the basement is inhabited by a drunk guy who does maintenance. He left the basement door ajar weaving his truck past our car in the driveway to get away then drove up and down the street. Really scary when he parked pointed into the backyard. Got pictures of piles of booze bottles etc. ",3,"walter of Mesa, AZ"
936,"As of this writing Airbnb and one of their partner hosts, Jacks Realty in West Palm Beach, Fl. have not refunded my money amounting to near $1,600. I booked a rental which turned out to be a health hazard and death trap which is typical of a slumlord type property. We could not stay in the place as it was so unfit and had to find a hotel in the area. I sent many photos as proof of my claim and Airbnb ignored them. The unit was not fit for human habitation and to say the least not as advertised. The property had just been fumigated with signs posted as warnings to occupants.",3,"Ronald of Palm Beach Gardens, FL"
937,Airbnb gave one of my guests a 50% refund - without my permission - because two hornets came into the property. The reason given was that I had not disclosed in advance that an animal was present. Hosts should be aware that Airbnb can refund with no good reason. I will be taking legal advice.,3,Caroline of US
938,Nothing but terrible experiences with Airbnb and their “services.” To say the least this company has poor customer service and does not take any responsibility for any mishaps that occur at their venues. They don’t care about their customers whatsoever or the fact that the places they post on their site could be a scam. They don’t check out any of the venues they post on their site to see if they are legit and meet their standards. ,3,Erin of USA
939,"I had made a reservation at an Airbnb in Quincy, IL. When I got to the place it was filthy dirty. I took about 50 pictures of the place, then sent a note to the host that I would not be staying and also contacted Airbnb with the situation and sent them pictures. After 6 weeks of trying to get my money back nothing has happened except for me getting the run around from Airbnb. The bedroom garbage can was full, bed looked like it was slept in. The towel and wash rags they left in my room for use we’re all stained green and yellow. ",3,"Vicki of Usa, USA"
940,"I have book a home to stay with my family of 5 in Canada but after 2 weeks we have found mice in home and inform Airbnb about it. They cancelled our staying home agreement without relocating us somewhere else. Actually recommended us a place 2000 mm always where we stayed. (Recommended from Ontario to Nova Scotia by a case manager, which I have proof in my email).",3,"Veysel of Usa, USA"
941,"We booked a home through Airbnb and paid the required amount. The next day payment was canceled by Airbnb and we were asked to contact customer service. We did so and the customer service staff we talked to was unfriendly and unprofessional. He did not give us enough details as to why the payment was canceled, especially after it had gone through flawlessly 24 house earlier with the same house. Clearly there was a glitch at their end, but once confronted, they did not give any satisfactory answer and instead canceled the account. As far as we are concerned, they don't have decent customer service skills. They need a lot of improvement and training on basic human service.",3,"E. of Nairobi, Other"
942,"I rented a boat (a 1980 Chris Craft) at the Jersey Shore (Wildwood, NJ). When we first arrived the boat was not was we expected it to be. However, I was ready for the adventure and was willing to overlook the lack of basic necessities as a result. But as time when on, we discovered there were many problems with the boat, for example we had no running water for the first week we were there, the host did not empty the commode from the previous guest prior to our arrival as he told me he still needed to do that (we arrived a day late so he had plenty of time to do this). It was more than a week after we arrived that he finally tended to the toilet and only after we complained of the stench on the boat as a result. ",3,"Cindy of Philadelphia, PA"
943,"Customer Service is unhelpful and degrading. Had an issue with a service they provided, which was a clear violation of their terms and policies, but the customer service agents failed to recognize it. And after several messages, just stopped responding. Seems like they will say anything to get out of actually providing real help.",3,"Benjamin of Los Angeles, CA"
944,"We have used Airbnb for the first time. We booked an apartment in Prague in August 2018. We were happy with the apartment... nice and clean, well equipped and quite central. Metro station, supermarkets and various restaurants at walking distance. The hosts were very helpful before we arrived at the apartment. However, things changed drastically once we arrived there. The apartment was so hot! We were fully aware that there was no air conditioning in the apartment and it happened to be a heatwave. So, we asked for two extra big fans (or at least one more) as there was only one small fan since the apartment was simply unbearable to stay in. ",3,"Kenneth of L-Imtarfa, Other"
945,On 24 July I requested a booking for 7 days with Airbnb. It was refused by the owner but AU $400 was still deducted from my PayPal account. Airbnb promised (by email) a refund within 7 days. Today is August 14 and still no refund. Any suggestions as to a course of action?,3,"Dianne of Paradise Waters, Other"
946,"First of all I’m sure there are amazing things about Airbnb, I was just unfortunate and didn’t have a great experience! We booked a stay through Airbnb for my dad's 50th birthday... the information included “sleeps 8 and has 3 bedrooms”. You could clearly see two rooms had queen beds, but then the 3rd looked like two twins beds. The host confirmed that it was twin beds, so I assumed (it sleeps 8) there must be a pull out couch. Thinking two couples could stay in the queen rooms, we could sleep on the pull out couch and my toddler (age 2) could sleep in the room with two twin beds.",3,"Caitlin of Gander, NL"
947,"Rude and unreliable. You might get lucky and have a good experience but you lose your hard earned money if you are not. Airbnb doesn’t take responsibility of an ill maintained home. Don’t go for it. I ended up in a listing where my father and I got sick within an hour of getting in because it smelled so bad, old and dusty. There was evidence of rodent infestation and the host sounded pretty unapologetic about it! I had to leave and go to a hotel. Upon contacting Airbnb they said since I didn’t give the host “a chance to fix the issues” I won’t be given any refund. Like, how can you fix the first impression of a guest who sees a book eaten at the corner by a rodent in a home you paid for?! Doesn’t it imply that you don’t maintain the house like you should have and now that you are caught, you want to try covering up? I didn’t get my money back - my hard earned money, but I am writing the review so that it can help at least one person!",3,"Piya of Column, OH"
948,"When I was looking to book a stay, Airbnb's website said I would not be charged at booking, which I wanted because I wanted to pay in cash. Well, I was charged. I canceled right away thinking I did something wrong, re-booked, and was charged a second time. I kept the second reservation. I also noticed I did not receive my $40 credit for being referred. My referring friend did not receive her $20 credit either. I tried contacting Airbnb which is a complete JOKE!!! If you're fluent in English, expect to not receive a fluent speaking associate if they even feel like returning your call at all. I was told my account has been activated for 2 years therefore, I was not eligible for a credit. ",3,"Sarah of Sheffield Lake, OH"
949,"When booking rentals through Airbnb. There isn't any explanations about the ""type"" cancellation your HOST has on their property, until you cancel, then that is when you find out WHAT TYPE you have on your stay. The site doesn't say 50% of the TOTAL RENTAL FEE DUE (even though you may have only paid the 1/2 that is required to hold your reservation), it just says 50% refund. Airbnb site also says cleaning fees are ALWAYS refunded, but that hasn't been the case either. VERY DISAPPOINTED in this as to I had 2 separate reservations I just cancelled (1 was not my choice but the other was because of this situation), lost $981.70 (only refunded $12.77 of $875.40 reservation and $31.68 of $1088 reservation))!!! GUYS, this is so unfair!!! RIDICULOUS!!",3,"Wendy of Alexandria, AL"
950,"I booked an apartment in Toronto on July 6, for six days in August. My account was charged for half the amount of the rental. Without notification, my reservation was cancelled. I only learned of this when I checked the Airbnb website yesterday, a few days before check in. I contacted Airbnb Customer Service, and after several attempts, I spoke to a representative. The representative said the host had cancelled (the host said Airbnb had cancelled). There was no explanation as to why, or why I hadn't been contacted. The representative said she was sending the file to a case manager in her group and I would hear from them. I haven't heard anything, even though I have followed up with the representative twice. Because it is so close to check in, it cost me 40% more to book a comparable apartment. Airbnb doesn't take responsibility for anything---it should be regulated the way hotels are. They should be accountable.",3,"Robert of Seattle, WA"
951,"I am currently visiting England from the US. Today, I found out that due to a “glitch” in their system Airbnb has cancelled my accommodations for tomorrow. I am now in a foreign country with no place to stay. I spent ALL day on the phone with them and they do completely admit it’s their fault. The case managers and supervisor said they were going to call me back and then they never did. They insisted on corresponding only through messaging on their app and would just stop responding. This has been an awful experience and after 6 hours they just texted me a $100 coupon. As if that could possibly make up for what they’ve done. I will NEVER use Airbnb again.",3,"Erin of Philadelphia, PA"
952,"Wow! After $877.00 later, hours on the phone, lots of correspondence with the Airbnb Caseworker, who can’t even seem to figure out how many days we actually booked or what actually happened, I’m amazed at the incompetence. I took photos of everything to prove our case. The place looked nothing like the photos and had not been kept up or maintained at all. Airbnb is not even able to negotiate with the host on behalf of a 5 star rated guest with Vacasa, a real estate company who is listing on Airbnb as a “host” who is mismanaging 91 thousand properties as stated by the host when we contacted them immediately upon arrival to the nightmare location. In all our years of traveling the world, we’ve never experienced anything like it. ",3,"Lydia of Flowery Branch, GA"
953,"I have usually been satisfied by the accommodations from Airbnb. Not this time. We were located close to the California town of Visalia. After a long drive, we checked in (Airbnb near Sequoia National Park). To our horror, the air conditioning was not working, and it was 100 degrees outside. Fortunately, they fixed it partially the next day. But then a swarm of ants and many mice greeted us. We left the place early. Clearly the home was not maintained at all. If you can't find a park lodge to live in, don't go at all. The distances are long and the Airbnb homes are not habitable.",3,"Godfrey of Long Beach, CA"
954,"I tried to cancel a reservation I made for Sept 28-30 in Worcester, Ma. I could not find the reservation or easily find a phone number for Airbnb. After three phone call and half an hour I finally found a person who would send me an email confirming that there was no reservation.",3,"John of Wilton, CT"
955,"As their new update policy, they force us to accept it and upload our government issued ID for identity verification. But they do not mention how they can protect our ID from being stolen. I don't believe they have this ability. Besides, including Amazon and any other website, no one ever requires government ID, they should not have the right to do so. It's unfair policy for customers. Thus, I canceled my account, and I will tell all my family and friends to cancel theirs as well.",3,"YANG of Fleming Island, FL"
956,"July 2018, a group of ladies booked an Airbnb in Atlanta. The place was unclean and in a less than desirable location. Upon calling the host and getting nowhere we contacted airbnb and reported the condition of the unit and expressed our concerns. After many phone calls back and forth we ended up at the Marriott and Airbnb did absolutely nothing for us. I would NOT recommend this business to anyone as it seems they back the hosts but do nothing for the patrons.",3,"Paula of Clarksville, TN"
957,"Guest showed up late, locked herself out and refused to take a full refund and go someplace else. Guest trashed me and the place and claimed things completely false or lies with the exception except perhaps in brain, obviously with issues!

Airbnb allowed a FALSE review to stand and then decided to ban me from their program when ""Safety and Security"" decided they did not want to deal with my persistence and disappointment in delayed payments!",3,"Sue of Kalamazoo, MI"
958,"I recently booked a reservation for a September trip to my hometown in Michigan, a trip I take yearly with my mother and my sister, all of us flying in from different locations. I used the 48-hour-cancel-for-free filter, and upon receiving the street address to the reserved listing, my 83-year-old mother determined the location was unfortunately too far from downtown for her to be able to walk to & from. So I cancelled this reservation within the 48 hours of having booked it and booked a different (and much more expensive) listing closer to downtown. To my surprise, my 48-hour-cancel-for-free refund did not include the $160.95 service fee, which I took to be a clear error on Airbnb’s part, as nowhere on their 48-hour-cancel-for-free filter is it specified that the service fee is non-refundable.

959,"First time user of Airbnb. HORRIBLE experience. Cannot recommend and will never reuse. Completed online registration. Booked room. Owner writes back that, ""I am not comfortable with you."" Taken aback as I was listed as ""verified"" by Airbnb, and he didn't KNOW me so how could he be uncomfortable with me? Then, searched the city to which we were traveling again. Booked. Only AFTER booking do I see that it isn't in the city I was searching but about 30 miles outside the city. Troubled by the fact that the company allows listing outside the listed destination to come up, but learned my lesson. Canceled the reservation without incident.",3,"Devon of Tampa, FL"
960,"We booked a condo through Airbnb for Sept 2018. From Ryan ** Of Indiana. We have a medical situation where our toddler granddaughter needs surgery, it is a have to for her health, we have to travel to Columbus Ohio in September, so we asked to cancel, Mr ** said it was not a reason to qualify for a refund. We canceled 2 months early, he can easily rerent the condo in Gulf Shores, Al. We were told there won't be a refund. That's not right, we were told to expect a refund the 26th of July, now today they said no refund. Airbnb refund policy is very unfair, be careful using this company, if something comes up, you will lose your money. I will never use this company again, nor will I recommend them to anyone, I hope Karma comes around.",3,"Dennis of Decherd, TN"
961,"I have to say, I am very disappointed with AIRBNB service as on 3 occasions, host has canceled my bookings which were made several weeks ago.

962,"As a new Airbnb user, I had some difficulty with two bookings. I had to cancel and rebook. I did rebook and followed thru with the booking. They counted those cancellations against me. My family had me book a family get together and when one of the grandsons was unable to come, they asked me to cancel the reservation. It was expensive. I talked to the homeowner, when I did the booking, explaining that I would cancel, if necessary, within a week, so that he would not lose the opening. When I cancelled, Airbnb charged me a significant amount of money.",3,"Susan of Truth Or Consequences, NM"
963,"Tried to book a property in Halifax with Monica. Never received booking confirmation so I moved on and booked a hotel. Four days later I see an Airbnb charge on my account for $1476. Note: cancellation policy is 48 hours and 50% refund. However, it is impossible to cancel a booking in 48 hours if you don't have it. Airbnb tells me I have 2 accounts and verified confirmation email was sent. Email they sent had invalid address ending in .ccom. They probably received unable to deliver notice.",3,"Jerry of New Braunfels, TX"

965,"Airbnb has no idea what a homeowner has to do in order to keep the home in perfect condition for the next client. And they do not care. As long as they advertise your property and take the money. My personal contract for our beach house clearly states that trashing the house or backyard is unacceptable and carries extra fees for cleaning. However, if you ever got your house or backyard dirty and trashed, to a point that it needs double time for the cleaning service to make it ready for the next client, you cannot get any extra payment - Airbnb claims that since there is no physical damage, they do not charge extra. On top of that, the communications from their agent are sharp, negative and totally inappropriate. My tenants had the backyard full of beer cans for 2 full days, and we had to clean it on Sunday. On my expense. I HAVE TAKEN MY PROPERTY OFF THEIR LIST. We have other agencies we work with who appreciate our business.",3,"Lia of Bethesda, MD"
966,"I had an account years ago that I used with no problem. I tried to log in today to find accommodations in Charleston, SC. The AirBNB site insisted I verify my account and suggested I do so through my cell phone. When I downloaded the phone app, the site wanted permission to access my contacts. REALLY!!?? For what possible legitimate purpose? No other booking site has ever asked me for that kind of access. The next step in the process would have been to send a copy of the front & back of my driver's license, passport or visa. I DON'T THINK SO!!! Can you spell: ""Identification theft""??? Message to President, Chairman of the Board, and CFO of AirBNB: ""I'll send you that information on myself right after you send me the same information on yourselves!"" Sorry AirBNB hosts. No business from my household!",3,"Suzanne of Huntersville, NC"
967,"I hosted for Airbnb and had some great experiences until this happened. One guest booked 7 nights. Then she contacted and asked to extend to 9 nights and would pay cash.

Point - Airbnb does not guarantee you will get paid.",3,"Charles of Point Roberts, WA"
968,"We showed up at this Airbnb house at 805 Red Oak Lane, Arlington, TX, 76012. When we arrived, the AC is totally non functional. It was 85 degrees downstairs and approximately 95 degrees upstairs. A sweatbox. The outside AC unit/compressor hadn't been serviced or cleaned in years as was evidenced by the build up of dirt around the vented metal panel that allows access to the capacitors. The maintenance people who showed up to fix the problem had to dig 3-5 inches down in the dirt just to get the door off because of years of erosion. ",3,"Jeff of Fortson, GA"
969,"The reason for the review is because we have been given vague and elusive behind account block. On 7/24/2018 we reverified our identities and we were reassured that once the transmittal from SSA was received funds would be available immediately. We received no notification or account alert of any ""unusual activity"" unless they count the numerous logins the past 72 hours. Who does not check their account constantly when bills are due. We received creditor extensions due to a security breach at our previous bank. This account ending card ending in ** had always been a mere back up account.",3,"ROBERT of Keller, TX"
970,Unpractical refund/cancellation policy. If canceled within 14 business days and owner is able to rent the unit refunds should be given. How is it that you have strict cancellation policy that only allows a consumer to cancel within 48 hours for a full refund when booked 3 months in advance. It’s best to use Airbnb for short notice hotel reservations. Otherwise you are screwed if owner decide to implement “strict refund policy” and will not accommodate unforeseen circumstances! I’ll stick with hotels going forward! Airbnb app DELETED!!!,3,"Shany of Houston, TX"
971,"I have only used Airbnb one time, in January 2018. About a week ago - July 2018 I noticed a charge for 156.01 with a confirmation number on my Visa dated June 29. I contacted Airbnb and after taking down my information I was told I would be refunded. When I asked how this would have happened, seeing as how I have no payment options saved on my account and my card hadn’t been compromised. I was told they would only release that information under government subpoena. I’m deleting my account.",3,"Matthew of Krestova, BC"
972,"I found recently especially that as a traveler, you feel intense pressure to only give, at worse, a lukewarm review or none at all. A few things everyone should know... your credit card is ""held hostage"" by Airbnb up to 2 weeks after your stay, in case host wants to accuse you of damages. How do we know they won't come up with some made-up problem if they don't like your review?

When I call the company they won't even talk to me without me giving them the last 4 digits of my debit card. I will not give them this information - I just had fraud committed on my account, why would I give them more financial information. I just spent another hour on the phone with Sheldon and Arvie and I not absolutely no help. Very sure I will never use this company again.",3,"Cindy of Goldendale, WA"
976,"I rented out my apartment to a guest. He broke a bed. I gathered the evidence that Airbnb required, they agreed to pay. They then rescinded their offer, no explanation. They also kept the damage/breakages insurance from the guest. That seems like fraud to me? Do not trust Airbnb.",3,"Stephen of Stratford Upon Avon, Other"
977,"After reading the 15-- 5 Star post and that the host was a Superhost we decided to Rent 911 Riverview Drive, Bullhead City for 4 nights. In the info pack that was sent we were told that the a/c was to be set to 75 degrees prior to our arrival- home was 96 degrees and a/c was off and it took from 5:30 in the evening until 11:30 at night to get temp down to a balmy 88. There were ants in the house, the flooring was torn out in the Kitchen, dining, living and bedrooms and basically a poorly stained and not very clean concrete floor. The oven (see photo) was one of the dirtiest we have ever come across (also the dishes- see photo) so we fixed no meals at the house (one of the reasons you rent a vacation rental). ",3,"Ron of Temecula, CA"
978,"I booked 3 nights stay with Airbnb in Florida. We stayed at an addition room from the main house, which is the owner live. The host is a nice man, no complaints! The reasons that I am writing this review is about Airbnb. We could not sleep on the first night because of the constant noises from the window ac in the unit, and from the ac condenser on the roof above the unit. We could hear the feel the vibration for the whole night. We tried to turn off the ac unit off, but it was too hot. We decided to leave on the next morning because it will ruin our vacation for the sleepless nights. We contacted the host to let him know our decision and left. We contacted Airbnb to ask for the refund of the remaining nights. They refused and claimed it was our fault to leave. If you are not happy with the products or services, it is our right to refuse to pay, although we were willing to pay for the first sleepless night! Airbnb just lost one customer!",3,"Loc of Garden Grove, CA"
979,"Reserved a place in Seattle two months ago for a trip that is now two weeks away. Got an email yesterday (less than two weeks from planned trip) saying that my background check didn't go through because of a criminal record. I have no criminal record. Needless to say I disputed it through the background check company they use and it was a simple mistake, same name, birthday and state, different person completely. They reversed their background check within two hours and my background check came back clean. ",3,"Joshua of Tallahassee, FL"
980,"We just stayed in the Palmer House in New Orleans. One of the beds was infested with wood beetles. We told our Super Host and she told us “they won’t bother you”. She never said “sorry” or “what can I do to make this right."" What she did say was let me sweep up the sawdust pile the beetles left on the floor. The couple staying in that room slept on the floor the next night. The next day when she saw the air mattress the floor she let us know “that we are from the north and just don’t understand bugs."" Not even an offer to get an exterminator in. Following Airbnb policy, we notified them when the issue happened. They notified the landlord and she promptly ordered us out of her lovely home. She even threatened to call the police. ",3,"Vicki of Medina, OH"
981,Airbnb is the most unprofessional and rude business that I ever came across in my entire life. They cancel people's reservations without advised them and without their approval. They like to spin and span their customers as they're pleased. They cancelled our reservations few days before our vacation to Italy. They were trying to get me for more money and give me different places. Of course a lot more expensive. I would urge you to stay away from these crooked people and please spread the word and let good people know how bad is Airbnb organization. ,3,"Nino of Gilroy, CA"
982,I am very upset and angry with the host referral programme. I have invited 4 hosts. And I have helped them to create their account. I gave a lot of time and effort. They have promised 250 for each hosts and gave only 86 euro for the first 2. And for the other 2 they told me the hosts I referred did not used the link I have sent while I am the one who clicked the links and create the accounts to help them. I really hope developers will create a new and ethical platform for hosts.,3,"Gözde of Athens, Other"
983,"I changed my phone number 3 years ago. Went to login into Airbnb account and from my computer and it said it had to verify my identity by sending me a text to my old phone number. Then locked me out of the account because I don't have that phone. No way to update phone number. No way to contact customer service because account is locked and they cannot be contacted without an account. Contacted them with a new account I created and the only response I got was an apology for how I ""felt"" but they apparently refuse to solve the problem or update the phone number. Two weeks have passed. Nothing. Apparently they are so profitable that servicing their paying customers is no longer a necessity.",3,"Gary of Seattle, WA"
984,"Booked an Airbnb in Los Angeles CA a month before my vacation. My family flew into Las Vegas from MD then drove to Los Angeles, a four hour drive. An hour prior to our arrival the host sends a text stating there are issues with the apartment. He suggests another one of his properties but is smaller that has only has 1 bedroom. The property we originally booked was a 2 bedroom. We opted for another property with a different host. Arrived at the newly booked property and apartment was not as listed. Listing stated king bed in one bedroom, was actually a queen and the other bedroom was listed as a queen, was actually a full bed. Wasn’t impressed with the unit but tried to make it work. ",3,"Kathy of Millersville, MD"
985,"I stayed in a house of an extremely conservative Christian Republican. It was so creepy. I think he had the house bugged and he listened to my conversations although I cannot prove it. He was just ok until he heard me without my knowledge having a conversation with my gay boyfriend. Ever since he stopped talking to me and that made me feel so scared. I thought he was going to kick me with guns and everything. But fortunately, he just ignored me which was good. I don't want to be his friend anyway. But my point is that I felt so anxious and stressed because I didn't know if he was going to act violent or what. I was in the middle of nowhere. I didn't have any motel or neighbors nearby. I wouldn't stay in Airbnb anymore. Just going to a stranger house is scary and you don't know what you are going to get, because the reviews are not always accurate.",3,"Pepito of New Bedford, MA"
986,"I'm a host, Air b and ** is forcing me to take all kinds of people with bad reviews. If I don't take them they penalize me by not showing my property when people search, or they fine me money. Disgusting company. They forcing me to host bad people who don't respect my place or other guests.",3,"James of London, Other"
987,"I've been trying to book an Airbnb for a night in Monterey, CA. Yes, it is a busy weekend and prices are at a premium. But it's the property owner's responsibility to do their own research on pricing. TWICE now I've booked a home and the price has been changed to a much higher rate - it's a bait and switch. The first time, I was TYPING IN MY CREDIT CARD NUMBER and the price TRIPLED while I was typing. Thank goodness I looked at the total one last time before I clicked to purchase. The second time, I booked and PAID FOR the home and got a confirmation and everything. An hour later, Airbnb contacted me and said the owner ""had a calendar mix up"" and now wanted to charge me double the rate I paid. I protested, but Airbnb cancelled my reservation, refunded my money and gave me a $25 coupon. Which I won't be using. I'll stick to hotels from now on, thanks.",3,"Maggie of Atascadero, CA"
988,"I used Airbnb for the first time to book a BNB for a planned trip. Airbnb sent a message stating the ""host"" had accepted the booking and then proceeded to bill my credit card for the booking. I made contact with the ""host"" to finalize the details only to be told they knew nothing about me or my booking. They further stated that they had family issues and were not taking any bookings this year. I have made attempts to contact Airbnb but they have no direct contact available and their site tells me to contact the host for a refund. The host was not paid, and as stated knows nothing about a booking. I am still attempting to obtain a full refund, but Airbnb's site policy states a refund minus their handling fees if I can find out how to contact them. The booking should never have been made by them and their practice is deceitful. They state the booking was accepted, when the ""host"" was not even taking bookings.",3,"George of Anchorage, AK"
989,"My mother signed up for Airbnb with a referral code I sent her. She accidentally entered her email as Gmail when it was another e-mail provider. They then changed the account appropriately but every time we tried to log in with her correct email/which they also had as correct on file it told her to please login with her “wrong email account.” The wrong email wouldn’t work either. There was no way to actually log into her account. We spent 2 hours on the phone Saturday, they route your call to Pakistan where the staff giggles at you under their breath and passively makes it harder to solve the problem (for which at heart they don’t want to fix and they find it funny because they hate westerners) and they just banter off the script and say I’m sorry Mr so and so over and over and I understand your frustration over and over.",3,"Joseph of Long Beach, CA"
990,"I am one of the 10 guests that stayed on June 20 and June 21, 2018 at 4 Tchernihovski St. Tel Aviv Israel provided by Airbnb. It is private home with 3 separated units. When we arrived we found that the units are not as shown in the pictures, the bathrooms had mold, the T.V. did not work at any of the units, there was no hot water in the second unit. The water heater in the second unit was hanging in the bathroom from the ceiling above the sink which is great dangerous and most likely against building code.",3,"Yoel of Los Angeles, CA"
991,"We were deceived by an Airbnb host. We wanted to find a place to stay in Niagara Falls, New York and entered that location in the search field of your website for the 7 of us. We looked at the results returned by the search criteria and located one we liked. We took a look at the property photos and description details and that's what convinced us to choose the property as well as the description stating how close it was to the falls. We knew the property had a strict cancelation policy and thought that wouldn't be an issue since we were not planning to change anything about our planned trip.",3,"Emad-ud-deen of Westford, MA"
992,"My husband and I just recently rented a unit on South Beach Florida. We had some real concerns about our accommodations when we arrived. Definitely not up to par for the money we were paying. After contacting the host, with no response, I called Airbnb customer service. I was lucky enough to have Macie answer the phone. Macie became my case manager and what a great one she is! She contacted the host on our behalf and within thirty minutes there was a call from the host. I will say the Host was quite responsive on fixing some of our concerns. However, in order to correct the problems, we had many people in our pad fixing the problems. ",3,"Vicki of Glen Allen, VA"
993,"I've used Airbnb at least 15 times but NEVER AGAIN. I've never been to New Orleans before and was so excited. Six of my girlfriends and I planned a fun weekend getaway. I booked us a house that listed as ""3 miles from French Quarter"" on Airbnb and paid over $1000 upfront (included $130 cleaning fee and $113 service fee and $45 tax fee).",3,"Karen of Davidson, NC"
994,I am a business professional. I have recently had the most horrible experience with an organization that calls themselves Airbnb. Their customer service representatives are rude and they tell the customers not to be rude to them. In that they will hang up on them if they even raise their voice. They have absolutely no respect for their customers none whatsoever. They cancel reservations on their own not their host but on their own and keep your money for up to three or four weeks before it is refunded. This company actions are criminal. In this organization needs to be investigated by the US government. This is the worst company I have ever dealt with in my life. I have never been so offended by an organization ever in my entire life and I hope that the owners of this organization pray to the good Lord for their souls for their criminal actions against their own customers.,3,"Douglas of Clermont, FL"
995,My husband and myself just had a horrible experience renting a place in Montreal Quebec through AirBNB. The pictures were lovely and the Host was a SuperHost meaning he had great reviews and verified by AirBNB. We found out from a person that works at an AirBNB office that someone could not have all those reviews since 2015. This was a scam artist that hacked into the system and is continuing to hack in as AirBNB keeps sending him or whoever money. We called the Host from the airport as arranged (as I had sent him arrival time previously through AirBNB) with the number AirBNB gave us and it went into some strange language. I tried texting the host who went by the name of Stephane but no response. ,3,"Carol of Shuniah, ON"
996,"I booked and paid for a month stay in Colombia through Airbnb. The host contacted me 22 days before arriving and literally blackmailed me; if I did not paid her an extra $450 dollars, she would cancel my stay and leave me without a place to stay. I DID NOT paid her ransom and I asked AirB&B to cancel my reservation and return my funds so I could make new arrangements. They said they CANNOT cancel the reservation until the fraudulent host do it themselves, YES. ",3,"Santiago of Calgary, AB"
997,"Had a horrible experience during our stay in Barcelona. We were victims of extortion and slander by our host who, out of nowhere, decided to accuse us of stealing from him and demanded compensation. We were completely shocked by his claims and reported him to Airbnb immediately. They were absolutely useless in mediating, especially given the seriousness of the situation. They even allowed him to give us a negative review. Needless to say, we will not be using Airbnb ever again! Once they have your money, they could care less about what happens.",3,"Hector of Minneapolis, MN"
998,"So we’re from Canada and made Airbnb booking in Mission, BC. Contacted the host, she gave me a link where I can continue with my booking, paid for everything, our stay with them was great, very accommodating and nice people. But, the night before we’re going to check out I found out that we’re charged almost $1k for 8 nights. From the receipt that Airbnb sent me, it was only $600++, as I was speaking to their customer service agent they couldn’t figure out why I was charged $732 plus a pending transaction of $181. ",3,"Judy of Calgary, AB"
999,"We had a 4 hour delay checking in because the host never answered, and the management took over four hours. Pressed for a review, I was honest, not mean or unreasonable. They never published my review, so I am unable to trust their reviews. Nothing is all positive.",3,"Ela of Enterprise, AL"
1000,"Recently I have had a very unexpected and disappointing experience using Airbnb. I made a booking to stay at a Airbnb in Seville, Spain, but my host cancelled the booking less than a week before our arrival. I did not receive any warning and only found out after logging in to check my Airbnb account. From their troubleshooting web page I was told I was to receive a credit voucher for my inconvenience but I never received any message or email as told on their website. When I went to book a new accommodation, all the prices had on average doubled in price compared to my original booking. But when I went to the check out page when making a new booking, I was happy to see they automatically deducted a credit voucher and charged the difference. But later when I went to check my credit card statement, I was shocked to see they had made another charge without my knowledge. ",3,"Minli of Auckland, Other"
1001,"We showed up at dusk to the address. The host did not specify that there was an apartment A and B at the same address. And most of the pictures of the unit were of the outside of the upstairs apartment. We went to the upstairs unit, which was the only one you could see at that time of day. When we tried the door a dog barked at us. I thought we might have the wrong address and had the Uber driver take us what ended up being around the block, where we ended up at the same address. I finally noticed there was a downstairs. It was really dark down there (Sam does not leave the light on for you). I had to turn on my phone and all I could see was a key lock, not the key pad we needed to put in the code.",3,"D of Seabrook, TX"
1002,"TWICE I have had reservations cancelled for no reason. The first was when I was relocating for a job. I had a Jeep full of belongings, and the guy who took my money for the week suddenly refunded it before my arrival and took his home off the Airbnb market. The next time, a week after starting my job, the reservation was cancelled again with no notice. I called and spent 30 minutes on the phone with the company only to be told that my account was ""under investigation for privacy"" and that my reservation was ""pending"" even though it had been confirmed (and now showed cancelled). The rep had an accent that made much of what he said unintelligible and when I asked for a supervisor, I got more minutes of hold with no one ever coming to the phone. ",3,"James of Portage, WI"
1003,"In February 2018 I booked an entire home in Oceanside CA. for three nights July 12-15. Paid over $1,100.00! Need to put my home up for sale the end of April. No idea it would sell in five days. Purchased a new home. Move in date July 8th. Four days before Oceanside stay. Canceled my reservations the start of May. I only received a 50% refund. Cancellation policy confusing as reads - ""FULL REFUND IF CANCELLATION IS WITHIN 48 HOURS OF BOOKING AND AT LEAST 14 FULL DAYS PRIOR TO LISTING'S LOCAL CHECK IN TIME."" ",3,"Mary of Waddell, AZ"
1004,"I live near an Airbnb and they are cropping up all over the neighborhood. I feel like I live in a commercial district with prostitution and drugs coming into the neighborhood from all directions. Temporary renters are loud, smoke pot, have disruptive parties, bring in escorts in mini skirts and don't care about permanent homeowners. Unfamiliar cars are strewn through the streets and loud music blasts until late at night. My neighbor reported renters having sex in the backyard where her girl in Kindergarten was playing.

1005,"I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND AIRBNB TO ANYONE!!! I had made a reservation with someone who was supposedly ""quick at responding"" which she wasn't. She was out of the country and it took Airbnb a couple days to hear back from her. Like way to communicate with your guests about your property and services and other questions we had. Her and the 3100 employees of Airbnb couldnt simply answer any questions or concerns I had. They will give the runaround for weeks about any issues that you may have. ",3,"Torie of Marietta, GA"

1008,"Basically, I found an acupuncture needle on my bed. I was disgusted with the situation and asking for a refund. Too bad I didnt take the photo.

They just simply denied the refund as I couldn't provided so called ""evidence""!!!",3,"Airbnb of Scarborough, ON"
1009,"I have several homes, and have hosted through Airbnb for several years. I have recruited other hosts, traveled using Airbnb, and have for many years spoken highly of Airbnb. BUT, now I have nothing good to say about the company. It started when I was out of town and a guest came carrying her bed bugs with her. Airbnb would have you believe that they have a policy on your property to help you if you have financial issues with a guest. This is a LIE.",3,"Allison of Okeechobee, FL"
1010,"I tried Airbnb a few times now, I don't like the time wasting of making a booking and then a host declines for no good reason, I was hoping it would be a good alternative to hotels as travel all the time, but I just booked a hotel instead of the unreliability of Airbnb.",3,"John of Select Or Enter, NH"
1011,"I first used Airbnb in April of 2017. I vacationed to Colorado and it went smooth and ideal. I left a positive review for the host and the host did the same for me. This was nice because after receiving a positive review, I was able to book instantly instead of waiting for owner to approve it. This came in handy for my next vacation, back to Colorado in April 2018 exactly one year later. I book a house for myself and 3 other guests (all of whom were also verified) in the middle of January 2018. I booked early in order to have a nice place to stay. Our flight left for Colorado on April 18th, 2018. ",3,"Justin of St. Petersburg, FL"
1012,"Airbnb is forcing my hand by having us stay at a property that is said to have MOLD, no fire alarms, broken items = UNLIVABLE CONDITIONS. The host, whose name I don’t know, who doesn’t even have a business website, and who is not very responsive says everything is fixed and that the review was fraudulent? Now a new review comes out yesterday stating there are still missing fire alarms, a leaky ceiling, and the worst of them... BED BUGS?!?!",3,"Crystal of Gilroy, CA"
1013,"I have used Airbnb to rent out my rooms not realizing that they are thieves. Airbnb stole money several times. I would host guests for four nights, guest will pay all the money, then Airbnb takes it all. I canceled two reservations due to family bereavement. I explained to Airbnb why I had canceled as I could not host the guests due to two family funerals. Airbnb promised to waived the cancellation and pay me back my money which they never did. Two more bookings were made, I clearly told the guest, I can not check you in coz Airbnb is not paying me for my services. Once again that waived fee was grabbed. Guests stay well clear away from Airbnb, families ask for payment before guest check in like any other hotel does! Airbnb are blood thieves! BEWARE!!!",3,"Beauty of Colchester, Other"
1014,"I rented a place in Napa Valley for my honeymoon and told the hosts exactly when I would be arriving and kept messaging them with updates. When I asked about a code to get in, they said I should just ring the doorbell. When we got to the rental, they were not there and had not sent over any instructions on how to get in. We called and called and waited and then eventually decided to leave and try to find a place to stay. Airbnb would not refund me for this, and when I disputed it with Bank of America, they refused the refund. I did not stay at the rental and did my part in showing up. I do not understand how I am not entitled to a refund. I will go with hotels from now on.",3,"Reema of Suwanee, GA"
1015,"My host decided to cancel my reservations 9 days prior to my stay in order to extend another customer's stay. What is Airbnb doing to protect its users like me who are booking through them? Nothing. They offered me $15.00 extra on top of a full refund to help re-book another Airbnb place or just refund all my money back into my credit card. They left ""host cancelled"" on the host's page, charge them a cancellation fee of $50.00 that benefits them and drop the super host. The worst part was that I wasn't able to leave a review of the host that cancelled on me.",3,"Ydnic of Tacoma, WA"
1016,"Airbnb is a joke!!! Not helpful at all. The ""customer service"" reps do not deserve to be paid for the poor service they provide. It's like a three-ring circus. The company advertises falsely.

I hope someone shuts this Mickey Mouse outfit down soon!",3,"Helen of Elk Grove Village, IL"
1017,"My wife and I immigrated to Canada from South Africa and made one month reservation with Airbnb, at 722 Queen Street, Kitchener.

Suddenly, last week, I get an email that our reservation has been canceled and our deposit returned. No explanation given, and when I emailed the host, he did not respond. I called Airbnb to say how upset I was and was told someone would expedite the issue and call me back. Long story short, three days later still no call from them, with an explanation, apology or anything. Can't find any good places now as most are sold out for the area we needed. We are beyond furious! We will NEVER use Airbnb again!",3,"Kip of Pleasanton, CA"
1019,"(2) We were locked out by the roommate. (3) Roommate answered the door with nothing on top and only a g-string on the bottom.

1020,"We've had a about twenty guests so far on Airbnb. The only issues that have come up is how Airbnb posts guest verification information and their lack of understanding of how it is viewed. We require a government ID from the guest to be provided to Airbnb and look for that information on the person's picture. When we drill down, several items are listed but infrequently, the government ID verification is not there. As a result, I have contacted the guest and Airbnb to find out what the story is. Almost without fail, Airbnb insists they are verified although I can find no proof thereof.",3,"Russ of Tucson, AZ"
1021,"Airbnb offers absolutely no protection for the customers in case the homeowner decides to cancel the booking. Even if you have reserved your place and paid all the money, there's no guarantee whatsoever that the owner will keep it for you, up till the very day of your stay. In my case, the homeowner of a NYC apartment deliberately canceled my booking 2 weeks before my $1400 worth stay, so I had to urgently seek a hotel in the vicinity - which turned out to cost me $700 more. On their end, Airbnb couldn't do much, and after a painstaking phone call with their customer representative, the best they could do was to offer me a paltry $15 discount on my ""NEXT"" stay. NEXT STAY?! Well, they are bold enough to think I will ever go back to their website again after that shameful incident.",3,"Olga of Costa Mesa, CA"
1022,"When I first signed up with AIRBNB I was excited. I had heard good things. As I used the service more, I started encountering discrimination due to traveling with a toddler in Phoenix area of AZ. One host kicked me out after one night without proper notice because my child was fussy. I was paying 100 dollars per night. When I asked him his name as I was checking in he answered me like he was someone in authority. Not friendly or down to earth. I have had two hosts accuse me of being extremely messy and in violation of house rules. ",3,"Christine of Carefree, AZ"
1023,"It is hard to understand how Airbnb stays in business with their non-existent customer service and total lack of concern for people simply trying to do business with them. I chose an available property, emailed the property owner and submitted my payment information. After giving all of my info, I got a vague popup notice from Airbnb saying there was some problem in accepting my credit card information advising me to use their HELP desk if I wanted immediate help. Of course I wanted immediate help, I am trying to book a property for a vacation and the clock is ticking. I tried submitting my credit card information again, getting the same error message. I tried using another credit card and got the same error message.",3,"Steven of San Antonio, TX"
1024,"In what other business, are you allowed to charge half the fee within SECONDS of a person hitting the ""request"" button... and it's non-refundable. I believe that is a direct violation of New York State's ""Buyers' Remorse"" laws and I intent to file complaints with everyone I can. Airbnb is nothing more than a free-for-all platform that doesn't protect the consumers who use it.",3,"Frances of New York, NY"
1025,"We have used Airbnb for a couple of trips and have had a great experience. Both hosts commented about how quiet we were and how clean we left everything. So we were shocked to receive a refund for the property with no explanation as to why the reservation had been canceled. In December or January, I booked a townhouse in La Jolla for June, as we will be attending a wedding in the area. Now, with the wedding soon approaching, we have to scramble to find accommodations. Airbnb should have the courtesy to tell us why our reservation is canceled. I will not be booking with them, again, any time soon.

They put me on hold for 5-7 minutes and came back saying I could not, I had to pay the rest with credit card. I said that was ridiculous and unacceptable, let me speak with someone that could help me. They said no one could help me. ",3,"Noah of San Diego, CA"
1029,"My experience similar to others below. Booked a room, but when checked in, place was filthy, it looked like someone else was living there unregistered, and generally had a really creepy feel. Couldn't stay there, but when attempting to get refund from Airbnb, they will always defer to the host. Because I didn't have enough documentation, they wouldn't give me a total refund. I actually had pictures of the dirty bathroom clearly showing dirty linens, but they claimed they couldn't see anything. So you take a big risk - if your host is a good one, you're lucky. If they're not and misrepresent their place, you're on your own - the host can just lie to Airbnb and they'll defer to them - they are host-friendly, not renter friendly. Not for lone travelers concerned about safety - residence mentioned above (""Parsa"", in Northridge, CA) would have been unsafe, because host never showed up with a key, and there were unregistered guests.",3,"Chad of Clovis, CA"
1030,"Booked the entire first week at a cottage in Sarasota, Florida. Place was filthy but since it was Easter weekend AND spring break there was nowhere else to go. Host refuses to acknowledge her place was filthy and publicly called us nitpicky as well as flat-out lied to Airbnb about us. Airbnb has completely ignored our complaints to them even when we pointed out that the host received 2 more 5 star reviews from other people during the same time we were at the property! Since we had the whole property to ourselves, I am curious where these other guests were staying. It's a scam and I will never use Airbnb again and I will tell everyone who will listen about our experience. The name of the cottage is ""Bayou Get-Away Cabin"" in Sarasota, Florida.",3,"Kelly of Welland, ON"
1031,"This is for all the folks that has ever thought about using Airbnb.com. I just left a place that was too nasty to stay in. Because I didn't cancel before check in, I only got a sixth of what I paid refunded. Because I canceled I can't leave a review. Keep that in mind when you see awesome reviews. Perhaps current photos of the bathroom would be wise to ask for in advance. As a disclaimer, my first two experiences were great, the last two has been so awful. I will never use this again.",3,"jeni of Plain City , UT"
1032,"DON'T USE Airbnb! I requested to book a 3-bed apartment that by the description and pictures on Air BnB looked wonderful. The host asked me to confirm the ages of the people traveling with me before he confirmed the booking. I did just as he asked. He then confirmed the booking, charging my credit card. 5 minutes later he messages me and tells me I will have to share 2 beds and the place is under renovation, unsafe for teenagers. I told him immediately that would not work. Then he tried to backtrack and say it's not really under construction but the rooftop was unsecured and not safe for teenagers. He knew I was traveling with teenagers as he had asked me twice. I told him I booked the place for the view and the fact it had 3 beds. He told me too bad if I cancel. It's my choice and there is no cancelation so I still pay. I canceled immediately. ",3,"Melanie of Lehi, UT"
1033,"For the first time I wanted to book an apartment with Airbnb in San Diego downtown but ended with a bad experience. The apartment is given in my search results when I searched for the listings with 2 adults plus 2 children. Airbnb showed this apartment as 'Rare found' and also showed a beautiful view of the downtown as if it is from the apartment. When we actually checked in the apartment, it is not at all child-friendly apartment, no child lock, our 2 year old can easily open the main door and go out, also scary patio from where you can see the down floors from the rails which got the big spaces. There is no view at all from the apartment.",3,"Srinivas of Newark, CA"
1034,"Upon gaining access to the rental site we discovered a leaking kitchen ceiling, dangling light fixtures in kitchen and bathroom and no working lights in any living areas. Within a half hour we notified the host that the premises were unsafe and unacceptable and we were canceling. We had to go to a hotel for the 7day trip; this cost a great deal more. Within 12 hours we notified Airbnb of the situation and they assigned a customer support ""agent"" to work on the case. We indicated we were not going to cancel on the Airbnb website because, per their policy statement, doing so within 24 hours of our rental would result in forfeiture of all fees. He assured us ""we were doing the right thing"". A day later Airbnb said they would only refund half the rental/cleaning fees with the other half going to the host! It was obvious that Airbnb kept their service fees and tried to serve two masters, satisfying none!",3,"Nicholas of Woolwich, ME"
1035,"After the host of our reservation, I tried to work with a case manager to find a new host, but had a nightmare. Case managers as well as supervisors didn’t call me back for days, on multiple occasions. We ended up having to get a hotel and I was told by a case manager she could reimburse me up to $200 to help cover the difference in the cost of the hotel and my reservation. A supervisor then reneged on that and wouldn’t give me a dime. The supervisor also took several days off while we were trying to resolve this, without notifying me, which would be fine except Airbnb wouldn’t let another case manager or supervisor help. Be prepared to work around their schedules rather than them working around ours. Or just don’t do business with them, I never will again.",3,"Wade of South Bend, IN"
1036,"My friends and I booked an apartment with Airbnb about 2 months in advance. When we arrived, it was a scam. The apartment had been rented out to another group. Airbnb support did nothing to help us and did not take our situation seriously. They stranded 3 young females in a foreign city and have refused to refund the $173 we spend on the rental. DO NOT USE this company!",3,"Diana of Littleton, CO"
1037,"My wife, two year old daughter and I stayed in Miami last year using one of Airbnb's listings. Upon arriving, the unit had an over flooded bathroom and disgusting sheets. The property manager kept moving us from one unit to the other to accommodate his other guests, and when we complained he threatened us - taking advantage of our situation with a child - and told us any complaints will make us end up on the streets. Airbnb made us leave the location for our safety, and the matter was considered resolved when we were offered a coupon to use and in return we would not file an official complaint with authorities. We now want to use this coupon (which is under my wife's name), but my wife is unable to travel. Airbnb refused to have me use the coupon which expires in 1 month, thus rendering the situation unresolved. We wasted our vacation and money, and it seems like legal action should have been the right solution.",3,"Ashraf of Winchester, MA"
1038,"As a host I have brought many concerns to the staff of Airbnb over the years only to be contradicted or told that ""nothing can be done"" about my issues. The latest of them concerned a very satisfied couple who had stayed with us for 3 nights prior to leaving on a cruise. When they returned, they were very disappointed to learn that their 5 star review was not accepted because it exceed the Airbnb's timeframe for reviews of 14 days from the close of their stay. THEY WERE ON A CRUISE! They were having fun and they figured they'd wait till they were back in the comfort of their own home to compose a nice review. No such luck...another one of Airbnb's ridiculous policies (of which there are many more).",3,"Caesar of Wilton Manors, FL"
1039,"Two days before my travel date, Airbnb canceled my reservation because of a past offense in the background check. I’ve been renting from different hosts for a year, given and received positive reviews, never had complaints from hosts, and never had issues with them. Even though I got a refund, I still have to scramble to find a place to stay at the last minute. I did not attempt to contact Airbnb because I’ve read that they give no help or response to people whose accounts they deactivated or banned. Airbnb say they don’t discriminate, but they judge people by their past. An offense 10 years ago will get you banned. It’s only a matter of time.",3,"Terence of San Antonio, TX"
1040,"I have been cancelled by Airbnb twice as an active guest in less than 30 days. I booked one In San Francisco then another to Jenner beach For the remainder of my stay in Cali to visit my sick mother. Less than 1 week of my travel dates I get an email cancelling my Jenner Beach reservation that has been charged to my account/cc already. Instead of telling the truth that someone made a mistake of posting such the wrong price instead they tried to claim that the host was contacting me outside the website. Which is a lie, because the host never responded to me but manage to approve only the reservation with no words of hey or how. “Deep breath house” hosted by Jacqui. ",3,"LAILANI of Concord , GA"
1041,"Booked a vacation on my debit card, instead of my credit card which overdrew my account. I got the notification within 2 seconds of clicking confirm on Airbnb and called them immediately (waited on hold for 15 minutes before talking to someone). I asked if they could stop the transaction and if I could just give a new credit card number. They said no, they could not. I asked if they could cancel the booking and just rebook over the phone with a different credit card, they told me I had to cancel online and rebook but pay all the cancellation fees. What a ** joke! So I had to spend an hour out of my workday to drive up to my boyfriend's work, get his card, withdraw money from his account, go to my bank, make the deposit to cover the overdraft. Such a hassle!",3,"Ashley of Encinitas, CA"
1042,"They keep your money if you cancel a transaction. Instead of sending your money back to the credit card, they keep it as a COUPON. If you don't check and don't ask, the ""coupon"" aka your money expires after 1 year and you lose it!!! Also, if you see a room but are not sure and don't book it, when you get back, the price is much higher. The taxes they charge the host and the guest are not clear. I spoke to hosts who told me they were charged much more. WE NEED SOME AGENCY TO INVESTIGATE AIRBNB.",3,"Roberto of Bronx, Other"
1043,This past week I had a tenant stop their monthly payment to Airbnb and skip out in the middle of the night. This violates my cancellation policy. Airbnb told me they would take care of the money and that particular Airbnb staff member never documented anything. The second Airbnb staff member said after three attempts to collect they would send the case to collections. That was several days ago and of course Airbnb has no phone number that they can give me to talk to the collections department. I am receiving no support or assistance in spite of their claims that they do so. Homeowner beware. If the tenant skips out it does not appear that Airbnb provides any assistance with collecting the rent.,3,"Marie of La Mesa, CA"

I woke up this morning to an email saying that every one of my rooms had been refunded. I leave tomorrow so I did the natural thing and panicked. I tried to log into my account but could not. I then received an email stating that not only was my account deleted but that I'm also screwed out of all my reservations. Turns out that, my probation that I had completed on deferred judification made it where, I did meet their requirements to stay with any of the lodgings.",3,"John of Liberty Hill, TX"
1045,I booked an apartment through Airbnb for an extended stay in Italy. The host could not meet for check-in because he stated he was going to be out of town. I had a friend that lived locally to pick up the keys for me. My stay was shortened due to credit card fraud. I left the key with the same person that picked them up since he was not available for checkout. The host called me at 2am demanding keys which I did not have. I was already out of the country but the host wanted me to call his relatives to make arrangements. A few hours after that call I received a bill for over $500.00 to have a lock replaced.,3,"Suzanna of Las Vegas, NV"
1046,"We stayed in ""Ueno Sharehouse for Backpackers"" last March 21, 2018. We checked out at 10 am the next day. At around 2:30 pm, host is accusing us of breaking the cup/glass in which we even did not use as we have our own bottled water. Host is asking us to pay additional JPY 800. We appealed to Airbnb and the only thing they said is: ""We feel this is fair as your host reported the damage before the next guest checked in"". Clearly, they just take the side of the host. They did not review the guests' appeal carefully. What if the host is just doing that for its random guests just to take extra money.",3,"Joanne of Santa Rosa, Other"
1047,"I have stayed at various Airbnb places over several years, and while most all of them have been ok or some very nice, others simply do not live up to what is advertised and end up being ""disasters"". And when there have been OBVIOUS issues with customer service and the places...i.e. filthy carpets, bathroom and zero amenities as you would expect from a bnb...oh wait, even the name is Airbnb, I am told that many places are just rooms in homes for rent with many other permanent renters already living there. Not really bnb's. Well, that is false advertising. ",3,"Fabian of Grants Pass, OR"
1048,I was headed to Columbia for a bachelor party. Booked the wrong place due to location and also a friend that visited the location and informed me the looks were nothing like the pictures. Also was in a unlicensed building. So I called claims and tried to cancel. Airbnb informed it was the host decision and of course the host declined due to very little bookings. The full payment was 9k. They took 50 percent. I cancelled 30 minutes after booking. Their claims manager took days to respond and took the side of the host. I live check to check and they wouldn’t even accommodate a common mistake. Their concern is for their hosts not their guests because that’s their money maker. They by far have the worst customer service information. I will be reporting them to the Better Business Bureau and recommend that no one use this company. Please spread the word.,3,"Nathanil of Cerritos, CA"
1049,"I booked an apartment on Airbnb 3 months ago. Apartment was shown available on Airbnb. Just after booking and paying I got information from host, that it was a mistake and apartment was overbooked. Airbnb didn't help to refund my money. Above all they refused to refund service fee, even though they wrongly offered an already booked room. Fortunately I had a honest host who refunded me completely. Comment of Airbnb: ""It's illegal!!"" NEVER AGAIN. I deleted my account. Can't recommend Airbnb.",3,"Thomas of Wallisellen, Other"
1050,"I feel that the main problem with Airbnb is that it allows a lot of bad hosts to get business that they would otherwise not get if not for the visibility that the Internet provide them. Many bad hosts are just very good at manipulating their image and reviews on the Internet so that they can take advantage of guests to make a quick profit. I am referring to the hosts which most guests would not decide to choose if they had been able to see the place in person, that is, in those cases where there are pretty obvious gaps between perception and reality. I also had hosts giving me false names, contact information, or pretending to be medical doctors or something else about them difficult to verify and I was surprised to find out that there is no Airbnb policy to discourage that. On the other hand though, Airbnb policies are tough on guests. Not fair. Airbnb policies are too biased in favor of hosts in my opinion.",3,"Steve of Toronto, ON"
1051,"When I booked my accommodation with Airbnb I saw the big print ""Free Cancellation"" (up to a week before arrival). Unfortunately, I didn't read the fine print that the cancellation does not apply to the service fee. Very disappointing that no watchdog is reviewing this type of deceptive practice. What would it take to have small print directly near the words Free Cancellation? Unfortunately, Airbnb has several ways to hide information that they don't want others to see.",3,"Klaus of Vancouver, BC"
1052,"Airbnb Hawaii. A ""charming cottage"" from hell at AirBnB. We sweated it (never used Airbnb before and won’t again) it as the owner would not release the address until the day before. As a group of three (one being my 18 year old son) we came to Oahu on business in Sept 2016 for 18 days. We felt getting a group lodging might be less expensive compared to getting 2-3 hotel rooms in Waikiki.",3,"Al of Murrieta, CA"
1053,"This is the original email I sent to Airbnb after I called them and they asked me to type up my complaint. ""I will send pics to follow after this email. I wanted to first describe the experience with Joseph in Siesta Key. This was a two day reservation totaling $3650. It was a completely overrated stay. This is a 1.8 million dollar house that should have been in pristine condition. There were many red flags upon arriving. But upon arrival we overlooked some looking forward to a weekend for my best friend of 20 yrs getaway before she gets married. So rather than a bridal shower we decided to find a place to stay where we could all gather and hang out without going anywhere. This house was definitely not what we expected. There were Cheerios on the floor by the front door. Fingerprints on all the siding glass doors. It was clear the countertops of the kitchen were not wiped down before our stay dispute the $250 cleaning fee that is required.",3,"Angelica of Lutz, FL"
1054,My business partner booked 2 different accommodations for a week long trip in London. Both locations were rated as 5 stars and both were unacceptable-less than 1 star. I could not stay at either for fear of bedbugs or worse. As a woman I feared for my safety in both locations. Both reservations were cancelled upon arrival and yet we charged full price for both locations. Airbnb's response to resolve the issue was equally unacceptable. We were forced to pay for the full 5 nights even though we cancelled and did not stay in either then we had to find last minute hotels at 350CDN a night. The stress was unbelievable. I will never recommend Airbnb to anyone. Hotels have spent years gaining their stars whereas any Joe can operate a bug infested rooming house. Call it a house with a private room for rent and have who knows who to write up phoney reviews for them. BUYER BEWARE. Airbnb is a scam.,3,"Barbara of Beaumont, AB"
1055,Airbnb will take your money when it should be refunded. I was not informed where the keys were located to enter my reservation so I cancelled with the host before I arrived due to not feeling safe to travel there without an understanding of how to securely lock the unit. I did not stay there for reason of safety and the lame customer service and host decided to keep my money and ignore the good faith effort to cancel before I arrived and my concerns for safety. Do not trust Airbnb... They will steal your money and they have hosts who ignore obvious reason to refund money.,3,"Brenda of Ross, CA"
1056,"I was a host on Airbnb with 7 apartments in the busiest location in the world for 2016- Osaka, Japan. Over the course of 3 years, I gradually scaled down the operation to just 1 and transferred to different website. Just now, I removed my last apartment from Airbnb and I cannot describe how relieved do I feel now, when I don't need to deal with these ** anymore. At first, they had great customer service and call centers. Then the sudden expanding of the company caught them unprepared for the size of their operation and the problems they haven't thought could appear. All in all, partnering with them cost me a lot of money, loss of business partners and respect from local community. They would randomly take side with clients, trying to cancel reservations with BS excuses, so they will not have to pay cancellation fee.",3,"Ivaylo of Varna, Other"

1058,"Airbnb refused to refund what I paid for renting a condo unit that was not suitable for rent or even for staying in it for one free night. We paid near 150 USD for three nights and I got refunded only 40 USD. I had both legal and ethical reasons to cancel upon checking in and viewing the place: The only aircon in the large condo was not working properly. The host representative who checked us in advised us to just restart the aircon every time it ""dies"" and it did stop within 10 minutes after we checked in. The host expected us to get up throughout the night to restart the aircon when it ""dies"". The host later denied what her rep told us and claimed that the aircon was working fine, although two people witnessed what the rep said. ",3,"Samuel of Sanford, NC"
1059,"The house was supposed to sleep 8 and only slept 6, it was supposed to be 15 min from French Quarter, it was 30 and sometimes more depending on traffic. The refrigerator did not work so all our food ruined and the owner never sent anyone out. The garbage disposal was also broken. We had to buy a air mattress and ice chest which was an extra expense and time from our vacation. Then a code enforcement officer shows up and says that this Home is being rented out illegally! I will never use Airbnb again!",3,"April of Fort Worth, TX"
1060,"I had a reservation at this room from 3/9- 3/12. We could only stay one night because the conditions were so deplorable. We were promised a rollaway bed and air mattress because there were 3 men staying. When we checked in neither was there upon check in, they finally dropped off air mattress with no blankets or pillows, then it didnt fit on the floor flat as room was too small, bathroom was full of mold, tiles caved in and falling off walls. These are not safe or healthy living conditions. They refused to refund me for the night we could not stay, they also refused to refund me for a future stay 6 months from now!! Do not use this company!",3,"Charles of Orlando, FL"
1061,"On the 11th of March, I booked an apartment in Poland. The response of the host was that the price was higher for the period (Christmas) that I booked. I filed a complaint at Airbnb stating that the EU Directive for Consumer Rights does not allow traders to change prices. It states: ""Traders are obliged to display correct and complete pricing information before a customer makes a purchase online"". Additionally, Article 7.12. of the terms and conditions of Airbnb for hosts states: ""You are solely responsible for setting a price (including any Taxes if applicable) for your Listing (“Listing Fee”). Once a guest requests a booking of your listing, you may not request that the guest pays a higher price than in the booking request.""",3,"Ralph of Nieuwegein, Other"
1062,"I don't know if Airbnb recently outsourced their call center or what but their service has gone way downhill. As a host that has two properties on Airbnb and VRBO I used to think Airbnb was much easier to do business with but that is not the case anymore. They changed my cancellation policy without notice, they've refunded my guests without consulting me, and after 5 years and hundreds of thousands of $ in bookings, they recently notified me that I am at risk of having my account suspended for ""only"" having a 4.7 Star rating while 81% of 170 reviews are 5 Star reviews. Besides the fact that math does not work, I'm not sure it's possible to get much better rating than 4.7 and I don't appreciate being their aggressive and condescending threats. They are so tone deaf and their customer service sucks. Better to use VRBO as host or traveler.",3,"John of Santa Cruz, CA"

We left without comment.",3,"Philip of Vienna, VA"
1064,When I first started using Airbnb I felt their services were excellent. In the last year I have noticed a complete change of customer service toward hosts. Last night trying to resolve a very simple problem of a guest requesting staying another night and trying to pay - it took 3 hours and at least 5 people to talk to. I was actually yelled at by one rep and told I should not charge them at all! Excuse me - why the heck not! I had some guests who were just filthy and had the house smelling like a garbage can.,3,"Donna of San Jose, CA"
1065,My family and I rented a condo through Airbnb which got broken into. The owner did nothing about it or the items that we had lost so we wrote a review on his page. He flagged it and it got removed. We followed the company’s review policy and did not violate it. I have lost confidence in Airbnb if they will not allow the negative posts along with the positive ones.

On the third day, we came back from an all-day fishing trip and several of our electronic and personal items had been stolen from the condo, approx $1800. Property owner strongly discouraged us from calling the police, advising that he would check it out. He did absolutely nothing. Airbnb would not accept our review due to their policy that no negative feedback is allowed. We will not recommend Airbnb because they do not allow honest reviews that reflect negatively on their property owners, even when it involves theft and personal safety.",3,"Carolyn of Bloomfield, NM"
1067,"I have always been a pleasant guest at any Airbnb I've stayed at, and have never had a single negative review.

1068,"The customer service is now past terrible. Airbnb is making adjustments on payments on their own, holding payments and doing it in a sinister manner where host and co-host are each unaware of each other's transaction which makes it easy for the payments disappear. Airbnb didn't honor a simple cancellation policy more than just once. Today I find out that I have a guest coming in few days, but I'm gonna end up owing Airbnb 250$+ after all transaction, because they claim I may owe them some money from March 2017??? If you are one of those owners that need to know when and how you are getting paid, this is gonna be nerve racking altogether.",3,"Mike of Lancaster, CA"
1069,Airbnb has denied to pay any money to me against the guest insurance claim. The house where I stayed burned to the ground which was caused by overheated wiring in the walls due to improper installation. I have been chasing Airbnb customer care for past 2 months and finally they have sent an email saying that they do not pay insurance for these type of incidents. If not for FIRE incident then I am curious for what type of incidents they pay the insurance and why they charge money for insurance. This incident could have been avoided if proper inspection was done by Airbnb. The American guests who stayed at the same house got the insurance money from Airbnb 3 weeks ago without any pain. This is a complete torture and racial discrimination by Airbnb. Please advise what I can do in this country as an immigrant to claim for my loss. I can share more proofs on request.,3,"Priya of Seattle, WA"

1073,DO NOT BOOK WITH AIRBNB. We booked a reservation with a host SEVEN months in advance. We went to confirm our stay with the host a week before leaving and they said they were not going to honor our reservation. Apparently they were not allowed to offer Airbnb in the residence anymore. They failed to tell us that. So we call Airbnb and request a refund and compensation to pay for a hotel (as we are 4 days from the trip - spring break in Cancun) they offer TEN PERCENT of the original stay. Trying to find a place to stay in this location and time is IMPOSSIBLE AND EXPENSIVE. I guess their customer service thinks that an extra $40 is enough to pay for a last minute reservation. THEN the refund was supposed to take 5-10 days when we leave in 4... Only after talking to 4 customer service reps and a manager was I able to get an extra $100 (which I'm not even sure I will be getting). ,3,"Cassie of Duluth, MN"

They will NOT Pay me for extreme damage that my guest has also admitted to me through messages that I showed them. They are telling me to resort through other options and wished me future luck with future guests. Their responses came on graveyard hours which is a scam because they only give a week to get estimates. I gave them an estimate from a reputable contractor that is licensed and sent them the messages from the guest and it still wasn’t enough for them. Scam company. Do not use them unless you are prepared to pay for any and all damages. This is the third time I’ve had damage and not one was paid. Enough is enough. I will no longer be hosting for a company that doesn’t take responsibility. Avoid from hosting!,3,"Rio of Carmichael, CA"
1078,"I worry about Airbnb insufficiently screening hosts. And I would not book an Airbnb by myself. But we've stayed in some very convenient locations, like Brooklyn near Prospect Park.",3,"Victoria of Austin, TX"
1079,When Airbnb changed their calendar format it cancelled all my blocked dates. I did not know about this until a guest made a booking on a blocked date. Of course I had to regret and apologize to the guest. Airbnb only arrogantly warned me that they would remove my listing if it happened again. I explained what had happened but no apology... US companies never apologize... must be their lawyers. Also I get guests that ask for contact information and I have to tell them that Airbnb does not allow it. Airbnb puts all the onus on the hosts. Their model is good but fading fast. I would love to have other business to work with.,3,"Al of Shemlan, Other"
1080,"Last year during the summer I rented an RV in Winter Haven in order to take the family to Legoland. We arrived at the RV and from outside it seemed nice next to a pond. We stepped inside the RV and the family got hit in the face with a poop stench. We couldn’t get ahold of the owner until a few hours later. Wife and kids couldn’t breathe because of the horrific ODOR emitting from the toilet which engulfed the entire RV. Finally, we jumped back into our car and drove to a nearby hotel.",3,"Miguel of Pompano Beach, FL"
1081,"The biggest crooks and the worst business ever. They removing reviews of bad guests with no reasons because they know bad reviews gonna demolish people accounts and they not gonna use Airbnb and go to hotels, because hosts wouldn't host them. It happened at least 3 times with me when Airbnb always could find something in my negative review to guest that violates their policy. The last case was literally catching off guard when the guy who stayed in our hostel made a drama on his last night staying when police almost came over because the girl he hang out with accused him in putting illegal substances in the drink and this screwed up idiot lost his wallet under the bed accusing people in stealing it. We saved that idiot from police almost coming for him because we talked to the girl and calmed her down. ",3,"Sergii of Miami Beach, FL"
1082,I would give it a zero if I could. The room at the Fontainebleau that was reserved 6 mos in advance and paid in full with receipt and reservation number was not cancelled by the owner the day of arrival.

1083,"Found a great home on Whidbey Island ""Anchors away"" right on the beach. Will be there for a wedding later this summer. After inputting all my info, they then decide my ID is not a match with my picture. Hello. That's me. What can you do? They thought it was OK enough to take my $1000 payment for the rental! Then cancelled my reservation at 2 am the next morning, stating they couldn’t ID me! Never called, never gave me a chance to submit another picture.",3,"Colette of Stevensville, MT"
1084,"Rented home in Cape Coral, Florida thru Airbnb. The host was Michelle of MHB Property Management. The house **. When we arrived we couldn't get in. The host had to be called, the host didn't return the call. Another person we had not dealt with did, after we go in there were no directions to operate the pool or hot tub. Again we called the host but no one returned our call, the stove was leaking gas so bad the women were scared to use it (very dangerous situation). The maid service left a note apologizing for not completing the cleaning of the house which we paid $325.00 for the cleaning service. Contacted Airbnb and the host company and they blew us off because THEY WERE ALREADY PAID! Sad state of affairs!",3,"Terry of Gaylord, MI"
1085,We rented a house from Airbnb for 3 days. The description never said it was a trailer/modular home. First arrived and there was a garage right by the back patio. Man came out wearing a pair of jeans and no shirt. He was not the host. He worked most of the day. Customer service said that since I didn’t have a picture of the man it was out of their hands. Dining room light was missing 3 light bulbs and kitchen ceiling fluorescent light did not work. Call host and they brought us over light bulbs but kitchen light was never fixed. Pulled a baking pan out and it was full of rust. Stove burners did not work. There was food under the couch cushions. Description said House was walking distance to wineries. Not true. Contacted customer service when I got home to requests refund and sent them some of the pictures I took. ,3,"Monica of Lapalma, CA"
1086,"I booked a place for my husband to stay for a month. What transpired was horrible. The place was cluttered. The bed had missing planks and you fell through sometimes. Fridge was filthy. The worst part was the bathtub screen was broken, so to get in and out of the bathtub/shower you had to sit on a ledge and squish your feet around. My husband hurt his back getting out and he finally checked out. The air conditioner doesn't work in the room he booked and in Australian heat this is unacceptable.",3,"Anne of Docklands, Other"
1087,Last week I booked a place for my family to stay for a week through Airbnb. After a couple of hours I received my reservation confirmation. Within a few minutes I received a text from the owners stating that the amount was not right and that it would be several hundred more dollars per night if I wanted to stay there. I thought it was some kind of a scam! I had to leave my home for the evening within a few minutes of getting this text. I thought I would wait and see if anything more would come of it. When I got home I immediately went to bed. After I was asleep someone from Airbnb called me and woke me up. I heard them say something about an emergency. I said I was sleeping and they had woken me up. And I knew it was not an emergency!,3,"Garnet of Backus, MN"
1088,I was part of an adult and professional family who rented an expensive house through AIRBNB for four weeks so I speak from bitter and first hand experience. On both sides of the house we rented through AIRBNB there were major construction works being carried out. Let me be clear - these were not renovations or extensions or repairs - but brand new builds. THEY DID NOT COME ABOUT AFTER OUR BOOKING BUT WERE KNOWN TO THE HOST AT THE TIME OF BOOKING. They were major building sites - in what was described as a quiet residential area. At NO time whatsoever did the host point this issue out to us. The overriding comment I am making is this. Problems within a rented AIRBNB can crop up after the 24 hour period. They do not always happen within the first 24 hours.,3,"Joan of Hebden Bridge, Other"
1089,"I recently went on our first trip to Europe, just my 10 year old and myself. One stop was in Denmark for 3 days in December. The apartment we rented from Jaroslav and Lina ** had no heat and wasn't as described. Upon entering, there was an unusual smell, but we just figured that different countries cook different foods and not every place smells like home.",3,"Cristie of Leetsdale, PA"
1090,We have had 2 cancellations with Airbnb. Last one they had $2000 of our money for almost 5 months and cancelled with no interest or bonus at all. Of course no other places or I would have picked them initially. We booked VRBO for years and never had an issue.,3,"Darlene of Regina, SK"
1091,"My daughter and I both tried to take pictures of our government issued IDs and our faces, in order that we might make a reservation. We are not stupid. We have both graduated from high school which should be all one would need in order to fill out a reservation. In addition, we have between us two Bachelor of Art degrees, two Master degrees, and one Ph. D. But could we make a reservation? Why no, we couldn't. It seems neither of us was capable of taking pictures that were up to Airbnb's standards.",3,"Judy of Brooklyn, NY"
1092,"Very troublesome and deceitful - I booked an accommodation with AirBnB. They sent a confirmation number confirming complete and paid reservation. The next morning they canceled my reservation, saying I needed a new photo and government ID. They should not have confirmed and charged me if they didn't have all the information they required. This happened once before as well.",3,"Pamela of Rockport, MA"
1093,"I was a host on Airbnb and the guest completely ruined my home. I wrote a negative review of the guest but Airbnb removed it. Airbnb does not what negative reviews to impact your profit margin. That means you don't see negative reviews of guests, Which means you are unprotected. That means that guest will destroy someone else's home. Airbnb is unethical and hypocritical. They talk about community but it's a lie.",3,"Ann of Dundas, ON"
1094,"Recently, the Trust and Security Dept. took my account offline because some unknown source may have hacked it.

1096,"My family and I wanted to visit Montreal for 3 days and decided to book a place through Airbnb, instead of paying for hotel. The booking process was easy and simple as usual, so no problem there. The day we were supposed to arrive, our host told us that there is a leak in his condo and is unable to host us. He was extremely nice and offered us a free stay at another condo, however we wanted something different so we declined the offer. We went on Airbnb AGAIN, because we thought we just had a bad luck and it was nobody's fault.",3,"Natalia of Ottawa, ON"
1097,I am a homeowner listing on Airbnb. Their customer service is horrible. My listing is corrupted so that I can't respond to requests for bookings. I have spent hours on hold with a series of reps who haven't helped. One rep refused to believe my story and I had to send her screenshots of the problems on the site. After spending 20 minutes on hold each time I got cut off twice. Supervisor was supposed to call me back. He never did. They redact emails and phone numbers so you and potential guest can't contact each other directly. So far I have lost 2 bookings. And don't know what to do next.,3,"Lorna of Brookline, MA"
1098,"Rented what was billed as a ""very nice condo on a golf course"". When I arrived it was actually a filthy trailer soaked in cigarette residue uninhabitable. The pictures used in the ad were not even the same property. The host persuades you to pay her directly on PayPal, then when you arrive offers a refund when you can't tolerate staying there. She never provides the refund & Airbnb won't help you because you've paid the host directly (at her urging of course). This is the listing, in Cathedral City CA: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4949043. Beware of this listing. Airbnb continues to provide listing for this fraud. In person she appears with her elderly mother & the 2 of them are extremely charming. The charm ends when you attempt the promised refund and the host begins hurling insults via text & email.",3,"George of Rio Nido, CA"

Property filthy in places especially kitchen- oven and fridge, bed at point of collapse, prescription drugs for owner in drawer in the kitchen accessible to anyone (we had children with us). Owner refusing 1 night's refund as we left without giving them notice or chance to rectify?! Would have taken them longer than the 2 nights we had booked to rectify! Airbnb NO help!

1100,"I had what I thought was a confirmed reservation for Ken's condo in Bangkok. And, about one month out, I received an email that Ken had ""canceled"". I could not believe it. Host are able to cancel. And, while Airbnb claims the host is penalized... The renter receives NONE of that penalty (it goes to Airbnb). So, you are simply left out in the cold to find another condo. Well, I suppose I could just ""search"" for a different condo. But, what happens when that host cancels? And, Airbnb claims to put notification on the host's page that he/she has canceled. One week later there is still no notification for other potential renters on Ken's page. Simply, BEWARE.",3,"Ben of Goddard, KS"
1101,"Guys be careful when you book on Airbnb next time. I made a booking No. **. I purchased air tickets and packed my bags for next days travel - only to hear that the host has cancelled my booking. And Airbnb does not take any responsibility to provide me alternative booking. Since it is the last minute - now they are demanding me to shell out 300% MORE so that I can get similar property. It is such a huge disappointment that I never expected from Airbnb. They charge you 20% booking fee, but when things don't go right, they just wash off their hands blaming the host. Come on, do we book with Airbnb because we know the host prior to booking?",3,"Ramesh of Taguig, Other"
1102,"SHAME ON AIRBNB. SHAME ON AIRBNB. I tried very hard to get help less than 24 hours after I had booked a room and wanted to change due to lack of trust of the host. Airbnb made no effort to make things right for me. You have NO advocate with Airbnb if things go bad... I had until now booked with them with a false sense of security that their customer service would handle things fairly if needed, however my experience with Maria at Airbnb was proof that they put ill educated and poorly trained people in charge of handling (if you call it that!) issues.",3,"Ma of Calabasas, CA"

I followed Airbnb guidelines and contacted a representative at their Help number, which took all of my information and the specifics revolving around the incident and damages. The rep said she would email me a form that I needed to fill out to report such damages to my property. 24 hours later I called the Help number again because I had not received the form as promised and a new rep said there were no notes in their system of my incident report.

So we rated our trips with one and two stars with a note about its infestation of unwanted bed bugs. First response from Airbnb next day was: ""Reconsider your evaluation"". We did not do it- nothing to reconsider. Second day response from Airbnb: ""You are not in compliance with the rules therefore we cannot post your comments"". When we tried to response and include a photo of our bites we found out that we were blocked out from the system.

Just a terrible representation of a business.",3,"Forrest of Bloomington, MN"
1106,Airbnb is getting extremely unreliable. A few months ago my husband booked a place in Paris. It was canceled. He rebooked a place again and that one was cancelled less than 2 weeks before he was leaving. A few months ago I thought I would give it a try again and booked a house in Barcelona for a very reasonable price. Dec 19th I get a notice that the booking was canceled.

After one night, we were forced to leave because the smell of natural gas and mildew permeated the apartment leaving us all feeling nauseous. We first addressed our concerns with the owner, who seemed to think we should just keep the main doors open (keep in mind, the doors faced a street with heavy traffic). We then addressed our concerns with Airbnb customer service and finally submitted a detailed review to notify other Airbnb users of our disturbing experience in hopes that the owner would rectify the situation for all future guests. This was one week ago. ",3,"Jayme of St Louis, MO"
1108,I made the following complaint to Airbnb about a fraudulent listing of a two bedroom apartment and they denied my complaint... there is no standard as to what someone can list a room as a bedroom: BEWARE!!! I have one simple question: What standard does AIRBNB use when allowing owners of properties to define a room as a BEDROOM? Is it the IBC (International Building Code) The ICC (International Construction Code) The IRC (International Residential Code)? OR Do you just take the owners word for it without any defined standard?,3,"Robert of Camarillo, CA"
1109,I want to love Airbnb. In 4 stays over 4 mos - average $100/night I found some very aggravating things hosts could easily fix. My suggestions: Check your cleaning service! 2 coffee pots were filthy - one impacted with moldy grounds - Clean often with white vinegar! 2 places had coffee pots - no filters. I'll bring coffee but the correct size filters provided by host would be nice. 1 had awesome espresso machine - that didnt work. Dust! Sneezed all night at a $100 guest house - in the AM I found the wall at the head of the bed was covered in dust! Under the bed same (Same place with moldy coffee pot).,3,"Susan of Gardnerville, NV"

I had to request a refund which can take up to 5 days to go back to my card. Luckily we have plenty of funds. However, what about people who can't afford to book another place without that money? This is a scam. Should not trust your card with these people. Hopefully the refund will show up and we don't have to go through a dispute process. I will not book with Airbnb again.",3,"Dusty of Joplin, MO"
1112,I booked an Airbnb home from host S.F. Maple in Jupiter Fl. After full payment they canceled our reservation a week prior to our stay with no explanation.

Well the picture of the cabin we chose was really cute and it looked so nice that I booked it for 3 days. When we got to the cabin it was NOT what it seemed on the Airbnb site and not what it was described as being. The cabin was only about 100 feet off a country road with 2 other cabins right in front of it. The people in the both of the front cabins looked like they owned their cabins and the front cabin had parking right up to the front of our cabin. There was no ""mountain views"" and the people in the front cabin made noise up to 10 pm. ",3,"KC of Cocoa, FL"
1116,I was having a major issue verifying my payment option which lead to a delay in my reservation. I had no other options and hadn't heard back from the host. I spoke with James ** who remained on the line while navigated the system and waited for a response from the host. He then offered to contact host in a attempt to make sure I booked the location time and price I wanted. James ** went over and beyond and was literally a guardian angel and prevented me from being on the streets that night.

According to the rules on the website there was NO charge for extra people, $100 cleaning fee, and check out time was Monday at 11:00 am.

1119,I went to NYC this summer through a private room that I booked in Manhattan for a really good deal. I had been traveling from Penn station to the apartment since it was relatively close by foot so I walked. I had been contacting the host all day but I had no answer. And I even messaged her the days before and nothing. I arrive to the location and still I have not received any information from the host as to what apartment number. This was my first experience with Airbnb in NYC and I am 18 years old in this city. I contacted Airbnb after two hours of no contact with the hostess. She had read my texts but no answers.

1121,"I contacted the host to ensure I did not have a reservation within 24 hours of my inquiry. The reason why is the site said his place was inactive.

I responded and reminded him of our previous conversation only to be told no, I was wrong. I have a long string of emails to prove I am right.

My first experience in an ""urban"" location turned out to be a room in an very inconvenient location where I was kept awake most of the night by barking dogs and then awoken in the early morning by roosters! The bathroom was pretty dirty. Fortunately, I was only staying there one night so I held my tongue and coped. On the next two trips which were longer, I found dirty rooms full of mosquitoes, no hot water to shower and no air conditioning even though it was listed as an amenity.

1137,"As a property owner listing my property on Airbnb for rentals, it’s a miserable, unfair, experience. They get payments wrong, pause your listing for various unfair or mistaken reasons, and are difficult to deal with. I recommend you stay away and use other major rental sites that I’m sure you’ve heard of. Those are fine, imo.",4,"Brian of Plano, TX"
1138,"Airbnb is a total scam. They canceled my acct on vacation and left me living in the streets for complaining.

1140,I booked at house in February and needed to cancel in March for a stay in August. The refund policy is very misleading. Cancel within 48 hours of booking and 14 days before check in to get full refund. Cancel up to 7 days before check in and get a 50 percent refund minus service charge. Cancel within 7 days of your trip and the reservation is non refundable. The host tells you they think you get back the amount. Airbnb tell you different. Service charges taken. Out of $393.28 I’m getting back $8.22 cents. ,4,"Sally of Calgary, AB"
1141,"I canceled a reservation 60 days prior to a house with Strict cancellation policy. Guess what, I still have to refund from the host for money. The host told me that my cancellation excuse is ""lame"", and she has the right to decide not to refund my money. How ridiculous? What is the point with a definition of Strict cancellation policy? On AirBnb web page, it sad that ""cancellation before 14 days will get full refund except service fee"". AirBnb is getting worse and worse each year. I won't use it again.",4,"Zoe of Davis, CA"
1142,"My first and only experience was horrible. I booked a house and made a down payment in January for a trip in March. There was an issue with payment because of my account being hacked into. They canceled my reservation without informing me that they were doing so. When I realized this days before our trip, I called and received the worst customer service in my life, specifically from Raven. They claimed that they emailed me to let me know but I never received it. They said I did not verify my email and that’s why. How were they able to take almost $400 from me if I hadn’t verified my email? ",4,"Tabatha of Saint Petersburg, FL"
1143,Whatever you do don't book Airbnb. They cancelled my trip the day before and said I was locked out for security issues out of the blue the day before. I wish I read the reviews first. I now not only have to find a place for myself but my whole crew.,4,"Joseph of Myrtle Beach, SC"
1144,"My first experience with Airbnb was one of a bait and switch tactic. Instead of a hotel, I decided to stay in an apartment. The rate was $201 per night. During the booking process, the rate increased to $250 per night. Luckily, I double checked everything before submitting payment. I ended up booking the reservation through another well known website for the original price of $201 per night, plus I saved a little due to the booking fees being lower. Since, I've received multiple emails from Airbnb encouraging me to complete the booking even though it's no longer available. I'm very disappointed and don't understand why companies participate in such unethical practices.",4,"Dawn of Birmingham, AL"
1145,"After months of struggling with Airbnb...I gave up and then easily booked my vacation at VRBO! No more shock and disappointment discovering the difference between Airbnb’s hosts’ posted and actual price of rentals! No more delayed, confusing communications from hosts’ reneging on pricing and rental availability! And perhaps best of all no more suffering through Airbnb’s so called customer reps insisting that hosts are too busy to post accurate information and renters just need to waste as much time as it takes trying to get accurate rental info or who arbitrarily cancel an Airbnb customer’s account because the customer objects to such a woefully lacking customer service model.

So I hurry up and canceled the reservation, but they said the cancellation policy is very strict, you may cancel the reservation within 48 hours and 14 days before check in to get a full refund. It is very tricky, I canceled my reservation 100 days before I check in but they still charged me 50 percent of my deposit which is $468.75.

Well, I am trying to cancel a 28 day booking I made in Budapest, but I am starting to get a really bad feeling about this host. I am afraid this host might be a scam, and I didn't want to risk getting to a faraway land in a country I’ve never been before, and risk not being able to get in the apartment with a child. I changed my mind and I was thinking to stay in another city instead, but since I paid $792.00 I wanted to get a refund so I could use it for another booking in another city.

I have read and re-read their policies on Host cancellations and have been going back and forth with Airbnb to get this resolved. I am going on three months now and they keep putting it to a different customer care department. I have copied all my correspondences with them and have shown them their own policies in regards to a Host cancellation.

I don't understand how they cancel my reservations hours before arrival then trick me into another reservation under false pretenses.

Knowing it was going to be a long stay, I called Airbnb prior, to let them know I was concerned about the utilities being included in the price. Utilities are paid per use and it is hard to anticipate what the guest will be using, mainly in summer with AC units. Airbnb told me not to worry because I would be covered by their standard agreement. After the guest had left, I received the electrical bill and it was 3 times more than what I had anticipated. I brought it up to Airbnb and the only thing they had to say was they are sorry but the security deposit can not be applied to utilities. Utilities are always included in the price. How are we supposed to estimate the electrical use for extended stays? It does not feel fair to estimate a really high number and make some people overpay.",4,"Yolanda of New York, NY"

Again I investigated. This was also false. Lastly it was a simple matter unrelated to what Airbnb support told me.

1193,"I rented lodging through Airbnb in Belize. The manager started running scams on me, and I vacated the (not very nice) facilities and settled up with the owner, including paying an early cancellation fee and getting a document from the owner that all disputes had been settled. Three days later a new charge showed up on my credit card showing a $150 charge from them. They blame the owner. The owner says I have to work through them, and I'm still working on getting that charge reversed, 3 months later. These guys are rip off artists. Never, ever again.",4,"David of Plano, TX"
1194,The house we rented through Airbnb was nasty with some blood and with spots on duvets and bed sheets. Towels were never cleaned and condoms under the couch. I forward all the photos to them and asked for a refund and their response was what I provided wasn’t enough. Never again.,4,"Amin of Northridge, CA"
1195,"Airbnb is a nightmare of a company. After walking into a loft that was vacated by Airbnb guests I was confronted with a bed that a guest had vomited and defecated on. In an attempt to conceal the damages, the guest wrapped the soiled sheets in clean towels, turned the pillow cases inside out, and ""made the bed"" with the soiled duvet. Upon check out, the house rules convey guests need to report any damages (not once has a guest stepped up for obvious damage) among other things that need to be tended to, like locking up. Guest did not lock the door and so I had to send someone over to lock up. Had the guest revealed what had happened, steps of sanitation would have been implemented.",4,"James of San Diego, CA"
1196,"My wife and I rented an Airbnb in Stavanger, Norway. The place literally made us both ill. There were rats, mold in the walls, mold in the wooden floor, furniture destroyed, appliances broken, no vacuum cleaner, bathroom illegally installed so rats had direct access to the unit, no lock on the entrance door. When we made Airbnb aware of the place we told them that we had both developed respiratory problems and headaches their reply was that this is not sufficient for a refund!!!",4,Michael of Norway
1197,"I had a situation where I rented a house under specific ""house Rules"" and ""Security Deposit Amt."" The agreement was made ~2 months prior to rental. ~2.5 weeks prior to our rental date the owner changed the ""house rules,"" notifying us that there would be surveillance cameras inside the house and the security deposit was changed from $2000 to $3000. I had full documentation of the original terms of the rental agreement as well as the changes made. AirBNB customer service reps (located outside of the U.S.) neither understood Airbnb's own policies nor did they care about the violation of the renter. I tried speaking with reps from within the U.S. The company is extremely chaotic. Could never speak with same reps twice. It was a nightmare. I lost $1260.00. I WILL NEVER USE AIRBNB'S SERVICE AGAIN SO LONG AS I RESIDE ON THIS EARTH SO HELP ME GOD! They are a sham!",4,"Patrick of Sayville, NY"
1198,"I’ve been hosting using Airbnb the last couple months and find the app and company policies to be quite unfair for us hosts. For example, anytime someone has an inquiry/question you as a host must pre-approve them staying with you in order to avoid penalties. I have had several guests ask to park at my place for up to 3 weeks while they travel & only book 1 night at my place. ",4,"M of City,City"
1199,"Fist of all Airbnb did not follow their company refund policy to issue my refund. Second of all, the case manager erased all the communication record between me and her in my personal profile of Airbnb!!!! Third of all, Airbnb case manager refuse to post my review to the host SPI Rental South Padre Island which steals $1556.17 from me without providing a safe environment and created lots of issues which qualified for the refund to customers based on Airbnb refund policy. I spent two horrible night there and was charged for $1556.17. Airbnb helps those treating and disgusting host to fool customers to rent from Airbnb. Airbnb prevented a customer to review the terrible host and just put the good review for the terrible to help them fool people and make their commission fee!!!",4,"Emily of Pearland, TX"
1200,"We rented a condo a month ahead of time. When we arrived, the lockbox code did not work. We called the host... Long voicemail saying he was out of town... Voice mailbox was full. Left text for host... no response after an hour. Called Airbnb... was on hold for 50 minutes. Agent said he would try to call host. Agent called back in 15 minutes saying that the host had finally answered but had then hung up on the agent! The agent canceled our reservation on the spot and said the host has the right to cancel at any time!! This is not the first time an Airbnb host has canceled at the last minute. I find that VRBO and HomeAway are much more professional and reliable and will continue to use them in the future.",4,"Jill of Greenville, SC"
1201,"I am saddened to share my terrible experience with the Airbnb hosts. I have never ever in my entire life of traveling experience such terrible people.

My greatest unpleasant surprise was to find out that the first host has no house available for me and my family,",4,"akhona of Other, OTHER"
1202,So Airbnb likes to ** with people too much. I normally don’t care to write reviews but I’ve had too much trouble with Airbnb and I just want everyone to know that they are the worst company. Let me tell you how. Bear with me because this is a long issue I’m about to complain about. In 2017 around June or July a friend and I took a trip to California. On the way to California about 2 hours out our Airbnb was cancelled. We felt with Airbnb for a long time and had a huge issue with customer service so we were told we would receive a credit for our next stay. Now this is a whole issue I’m not about to get into because it has nothing to do with this current issue but I want you to know before I took my trip on 11/14/2018 I called Airbnb since I never received credit from my trip in 2017. I called and they gave me 100$ credit FOR MY TROUBLES in 2017. Keep that in mind.,4,"Naturally of Scottsdale, AZ"
1203,"We recently rented an apartment in Barcelona Spain, and the experience wasn't good at all, neither the support from Airbnb. The apartment was dirty, no sheets, no towels and the AC did not work. It is really frustrated and unfortunate for most customers as I went through the reviews here. Airbnb seems to care only about the money from the host and they take the side of the host, no matter what they say, I realize that they can say anything, and that is really troubling, not fair and not right at all, and gives you with a bad taste and awful experience that makes you question choosing Airbnb again.",4,"Belinda of Oviedo, FL"
1204,"Airbnb warning. Just a warning that not all hosts are honest. I recently booked a home in Isla Mujeres in Mexico for the month of February and luckily enough was in Mexico in December and took a day out of my vacation to check out the rental. We hired a local cab driver to help us find the property. We not only never found the house but the street it was supposed to be on was in a slum and garbage lined the streets, bars on all the windows, nothing even close to the picture on the Airbnb listing. ",4,Antje of Canada
1205,"If you are looking for renting a property through this booking site please read carefully and be aware. Hidden fees - The prices listed seem to be lower compared to some hotels, but that is misleading. Once you get to the check out you all of sudden notice that 1. They charge you booking fee for every day you book - that seems to be % of your booking so it can add up to $80-$100 extra. 2. Many hosts will charge you cleaning fee $30-$35. 3. Many hosts will want you to also pay for electricity and water. 4. Add to that you get no daily service. 5. No free breakfast. 6. No airport shuttle. 7. No 24 hrs front desk service since the host lives usually quite far or in different country. All added up you pay a lot more for the booking than in the hotel.",4,"Michael of Columbia, SC"
1206,I have used AirBnB quite often and never had a complaint. This time the apartment we rented was not owned or rented by the host who listed it on the site. Someone else was occupying it. Seems it was a fraud case. While I had no issues with the AirBnB agent who was forthcoming and supportive it took us nearly two hours to get someone on the phone or chat. All three travelers were trying to contact AirBnB by phone and chat. Every time the system or someone (?) hung up after 40 to 60 minutes of listening to that awful music. Basically if you have a problem you are on your own. After nearly two hours we finally got someone on the line who authorized us to take a hotel which would be reimbursed. I hope that works.,4,"Udo of Denver, CO"
1207,"I recently stayed at a room in a private home, with a shared bathroom and the experience wasn't good at all, neither the support from Airbnb, and it is really frustrated and unfortunate for most customers as I went through the reviews here.

1208,"The experience overall was good as a host, But I do have an issue with not being informed/alerted that I had to provide an identity to withdraw the money! It's basically hidden info on the site while it should be very clear to me before I proceed to have a guest in my house. It's been a few months and the guest is gone and I still can't receive my money (That I started the whole thing because I was in need of it at that time), I can't do that because I don't own a passport and that's the only option they gave me to prove my identity so they made it even harder for me! That's an issue or that's what I think is an issue.",4,"Moustafa of Other, OTHER"

1210,"An Airbnb host cancels unexpected two days prior to the check-in date for a family New Year's celebration. When ""working"" for over four hours with the Airbnb Customer Service, all of whom are shocked that the limited comps are so expensive so close to a major holiday. Airbnb provided poor alternatives for a family trip, stating that other options were too expensive. Their solution was to receive a partial reimbursement after the fact. Not to mention this was after four LONG phone calls and four hours of nothingness. I expected more. My fault for assuming anything good from Airbnb.",4,"Sean of Saint Louis, MO"
1211,"I stayed in an Airbnb in this Nov 2018 for 16 days in a house in Canada, Toronto, Pintail Cres. The host entered my room without permission 3 times, or more. The host's wife, Olxa, informed me at night that the host Darxn was in my room to unplug my MP3 Player. There is no advanced notification for permission to enter my room. On the second last day of my stay, when I came back at night, I found a gift paper wrapped cookie on my desk. Nobody asked for permission to enter the room or notified me after the entering up to this Dec 22, 2018. My concern is that that day I was rushed out for training and forgot to lock my luggage which has my passport, ID cards, credit cards etc important personal info.",4,"Candie of San Jose, CA"
1212,"I have been using Airbnb since 2016. Every time I encountered a problem, Airbnb takes the side of the host irrespective of the circumstances. They also hide or delete bad reviews at the request by the host. My recent experience was, I arrived at this house to find out the place is dirty and had cutlery with food particles on them. The floor infested with ants and there were a few flies, those large ones that appear during summer, in the house. The house was facing the host's backyard and the place was a mess. Due to these shortcomings I immediately notified Airbnb after attempting to contact the host. The Airbnb contacted the host. When the host arrived at the property, they were visibly upset and appeared aggressive. They tried to pick an argument which I tried hard to avoid, which made me really uncomfortable and felt threatened at the time. I was alone at their property and anything could happen when someone is upset.",4,Upul of Australia
1213,They advertise that you can get a refund within 14 days before check-in. Please read the fine print because they don't. They have you pay for half the duration e.g 5 days if you will stay for 10 days. If you cancel after 38 hours but within the 14 days you get nothing back and they still advertise for the days you have paid for that you didn't get a refund. Talk about double payment.,4,Fibi of Other
1214,"We have a trip planned in a week and just received a text cancelling our rental. They offer to refund our money, but getting something in a strange place with one week's notice is not easy. Not only are places more expensive with such short notice, we cannot get a great place for our vacation and have to settle for whatever we can get. Such a disappointment. How is this acceptable when we rented the place two months ago. No apology or explanation. I WILL NEVER TRUST THIS SERVICE AGAIN.",4,"Deborah of Reno, NV"
1215,"We had booked a cabin for 12/28/2018-12/30/2018. Just two weeks before our trip, the host calls that the cabin isn’t available anymore due to the owners selling it, and not giving a 60 day notice. Just two weeks before my family arrives from Florida expecting a cabin, and in the busiest day of the year. There were no other selections in our price range so we don’t get any other cabin for that date due to the others being more expensive. Instead we get a measly credit of $101 for another booking, yet there are none left. This ruined our trip, especially since my family has been going through a hard time lately, and me and my wife wanted to treat them to a relaxing getaway. ",4,"M. of Dayton, TN"
1216,I was visiting Lima Peru and booked a 1 bedroom apartment through Airbnb. (I have used my account with Airbnb in the past without any issue.) Upon arrival I was handed the keys from the landlord. She immediately explained the apartment wasn’t ready at the moment which was fine because I wasn’t going to be returning until The evening So I took the keys and left. I returned around 7 pm with my belongings and noticed the apartment was dirty particularly the bathroom since it clearly showed signs that it hadn’t been cleaned. There was a half used soap in the soap holder of the shower and a very dirty white rug to put your feet on after a shower. There was also no hand soap at all by the sink and there was one hand towel that was moist as if it had already been used. ,4,"Sandra of Hallandale, FL"
1217,The assigned case manager hasn't contacted me for almost 24 hours on a time sensitive issue! They only care about making money and they usually side with the host.

1218,MY AIRBNB ACCOUNT WAS DISABLED FOR NO VALID REASON!!! I was a regular Airbnb user for years until they put my account under review. I've been waiting since about December 2016 for a response on why my account was disabled. I've emailed & called them several times over the wait. They just sent a response December 2018. (TWO YEARS LATER!) Companies love throwing their 'terms of service' at you & telling you what they're not liable for when they are being **.

On 8th December after the Paris violent protests, we asked for a cancellation and requested to change our booking to a safer location on 29 Dec. The roads to Ave Macmahon were blocked and metros around there were closed on 8 Dec. Tear gas and water cannons were fired right outside this apartment! After 3 days of email and multiple phone calls Airbnb has denied us a change even though we highlighted that it was unsafe especially for the kids. On their Airbnb website they have listed violence, inaccessibility and safety hazard as conditions for refund. Shouldn't they honor it? Their reply is, ""The host has refused a refund!""",4,Lim of Singapore
1221,"They're a worst. I booked a trip like 5 days ahead. I wanted to cancel it the next day, which is still within 48 hour, since my schedule changed. They won't give me full refund, only 50% of it; they said the cancellation has to be within 48 hours AND 14 days ahead. How stupid is that? How can I have 14 days notice if I just book a room for a trip next week? They told me to go talk to the host as they can't do anything. I wish they're out of business soon. Heard they said they would go public, pray lord. The most irresponsible business model in the world. Use Booking.com instead.

Capital One is trying to stick me with the full amount, even though Airbnb allows the host to not only insult guests that have stayed at her house, but also scam people with her rental, as there are numerous reviews stating that the host has roaches in her rental property. The fact that Airbnb allows this is beyond ridiculous, and Airbnb doesn't take care of its customers. They're in it for the host to rent locations to guests, sight unseen, fake pictures, fake reviews, unsafe locations, and unsanitary situations. Don't waste your money. Get a hotel room, you'll be way better off.",4,"Kristy of Burbank, IL"

I contacted Airbnb and they told me they were false reviews and I had nothing to worry about. They assured me that if I saw any when I checked in that they would move us. We checked in and we started seeing them everywhere!!! I contacted them and not only did they not move us but they only refunded $120 of the $950 we paid! We had to spend the trip in a cockroach infested place. I called, asked to speak to a manager and they did not care. They closed the case and told me it was my choice to stay there. I have used Airbnb for years and I cannot believe how they treated this situation.",4,"Sarah of Martinez, CA"
1227,I booked a condo for a week in the Philippines and when we arrived to the condo it smelled like mold. The smell was really bad. I left immediately. Could not stay in an apartment that smelled so bad. I contacted Airbnb and asked for a refund. They were on the side of the host and only refunded me half. They did not protect me and were more on the side of the host. I posted a bad review about the host and it was never posted. There was no bad language used just being honest about my experience and it was not posted. No wonder the host has so many good reviews and no negative. I will not trust Airbnb anymore. It's a gamble. Imagine traveling far away and when you get there it's not what you expected. Who has your back because Airbnb won't.,4,"Hector of Union City, NJ"

They declined to protect the host saying guest are free to say what they please so long as they aren't racist. I then explained I was not going to offer the guest money and instead provided Airbnb the plumber's note confirming the radiators were working and the house was above average hot, on top of which the guest had left windows open.

Just today, I wrote a bad review on Airbnb for an awful host and it was removed within the hour. I didn't break the guidelines, they didn't give me a valid reason for removing my review. I just guess that only good reviews sell. That is why I chose that host in the first place (all good reviews)… But if Airbnb removes the bad reviews, you have no way to know. I stopped using Airbnb because Airbnb is nothing without the honest reviews.",4,"Michael of Lebanon, Other"

They did not want to reimburse us and they will not that the listing off, so beware when you plan your next vacation. They also edited your review and only post positive reviews.

1233,"The place I rented did not have the amenities it promised (heated pool) and was dirty. Also the host showed up in our backyard in the dark with a flashlight unannounced during our stay and it made us feel extremely unsafe. So, there is the component of having a host that is dodgy. But the component that compelled me to write this review is the way Airbnb handled my concern. They sided with the host based on his rating overall rather than my individual experience. My experience was uniquely bad but because his reviews were ok from other guests my concern were not addressed and was minimized. There is no direct number to contact Airbnb and so all complaints are logged in an e-mail process. They called me back and that's when I got their number.

Most of the time the electricity in the common areas is blacked out making it impossible to see where you're going and also impossible to know if you are being followed.

While I understand I have a record from when I was young and dumb but if this keeps me from getting a place shouldn't it be looked into before you take my money and give me codes for the house?

1248,"I'm not even sure where to begin. My girlfriend and I stayed at a cabin in Greenbank Whidbey Island, WA. The water was shut off on us in the midst of a shower and no water worked in the cabin at all. The chimney must not have been cleaned in a century. We were smoked out but the host claimed the wood was wet...which wasn't true. We traveled to Walmart 30 miles away because they left us two huge pieces of wood and nothing to start it with. The wood wasn't wet because it was inside the store. I use my own fireplace quite often.",4,"michelle of Renton, WA"
1249,"Airbnb says last 4 digits of SS# is ""wrong"" which is BS! Can't upload pics of driver's license because site keeps saying the pics are ""too big"" even tho' I kept resizing the pics smaller and smaller. On chat for an hour... Last 30 min got NO replies to messages, so I finally told them to screw it! I had no problems whatsoever booking something this past October... So why all the crap now? So much for trying to save some money on places to stay when I travel now! >:-(",4,"Judy of Parkersburg, WV"

1251,"I was looking to book a condo using Airbnb. This was my first time using their service. I wanted to make sure there were no other fees aside from the total shown during booking so I called the customer service number. I was reassured that there were no other fees to be collected as this was against Airbnb policy. I asked because I saw a mention of taxes were to be collected. I asked the same question and was given the same answer. This was around 11pm at night. The following day, the property manager called me about the taxes due. I called customer service and I was told I was to pay the taxes since it's listed on the website. Well, that's why I called prior to booking. ",4,"C of Houston, TX"

Booking an Airbnb with Nina, Marais district, Paris France, was my first experience at booking an Airbnb, and consequently will be my only experience, booking anything through Airbnb. My trip was schedule and then Hurricane Irma hit (the largest hurricane to hit the state of Florida in history). Nina told me to reschedule but I had to contact her off Airbnb. (I later learned this was so she could still collect my payment and Airbnb would still get their kickback). She let me reschedule and then on the day I was supposed to fly out, she told me she double booked and that I would have to stay at a different location, for which she refused to disclose details.",4,"Sarah of Vero Beach, FL"
1254,Beware booking with Airbnb far in advance of your trip. I just booked an apartment in Malta for a month in March and they charged me the full amount on Nov 7th rather than a deposit and the balance in February. When I phoned Customer Service there is of course nothing they can do. Just be careful when booking - make sure you are pre-approved for the rental then you will have the option of 2 payments.,4,Fred of Canada

After our 50% deposit was accepted and our reservation confirmed the “Hosts” called me separately, emailed me and sent me a private message over Airbnb that they had accidentally posted the incorrect price and if we did not accept their “altered” price of $535 a night then they would cancel our reservation. Knowing they legally can’t make us pay for their mistake, the wife called me begging that we please cancel or they would not be able to make their mortgage. ",4,"Jennifer of Grand Prairie, TX"
1256,"I and my wife rented a house in Lake Havasu for two weeks at a price of about $4,000.00. We were so eaten by bed bugs. We reported this to the owner and to Airbnb. We were told to take pictures to prove the bedbug. We took several pictures and sent them to the owner and Airbnb. We were told that the owner had supposedly taken care of the problem but my wife and my grandkids were bitten all over by the bed bugs. We were told that we should have reported it as soon as we got bit. We waited a couple of days to make sure what they were. We were offered a whole 10% off the rental rate. We will have bills for fixing our house and the houses of our children and their kids. I will never use this service again due to way we were treated. I highly encourage everyone not to use this service-ever!",4,"Dennis of Wilsonville, OR"

When I came home later that day it was raining in my garage, the bathroom is right above the garage. He caused a lot of damage to my home and had the nerve to leave me a bad review.

The owner was not helpful at all, actually he was slightly hostile. And of course I didn't get some of the money back that I have paid. When I came home I was going to write a scathing review of this place but oh no. I had two weeks to do it they said, but after a few days it was too late. I contacted Airbnb about the review/deadline but that was like talking to a wall. It's extremely hard to get any response and when they finally answer they are of no help at all.

After a week, Airbnb did no do ANYTHING for me regarding this issue and they just cancel my reservation without any support. They let the host do whatever they want to the customers and they do not give any support to their customers. They even do not have any review system in their website after they cancel your reservation.

1260,"I complained to Airbnb about cockroaches in my Toquerville, Utah, rental. The owner didn’t take accountability and Airbnb sides with her. They said they would only give me 1/2 of my money back, which I still have yet to see, because the roach photos I sent “didn’t prove an infestation."" What??? I didn’t realize a few cockroaches are a-ok when hosting tenants! (There were more than a few, but my pictures showed only several at once.)  Airbnb should be consumer-based, rather than siding with their hosts so much, judging by the other reviews.

I asked if there was a lot nearby. He assured me that the neighborhood was safe and that we could get both our cars in his driveway. Ok, cool.",4,"Kim of Youngstown, OH"
1262,So I moved provinces in Canada and before my son and I could settle down we booked into a *5 Star superhost* apartment in Toronto for 31 days. The pics were of a different apartment. The place was filthy dirty. The stove almost burnt us and the microwave was broken. The owner was out of the country and realized that he was renting the place and then *renting as an Airbnb* when he was away or staying at his girlfriend's. The owner of the place I mean my host's landlord one time stopped me and asked me what I was doing in his building.

Owners also did an oops and left the door to their hoarder room open, and then didn’t even have our room ready. I couldn’t get out quick enough and went to battle with Airbnb. They were difficult and wanted to charge 1/2 due to us “cancelling”. I insisted on sending pics to justify why we should get full refund. If I hadn’t taken pics, I’m sure I would have had to pay.

1268,"The additional fees are a rip-off. In the end the total costs work out more expensive than staying at a good reliable hotel in more central location.

When I found a good 3 star hotel with breakfast included at a more Tokyo central location, which is also part of Qantas travel program, I attempted cancelling the Airbnb reservation, only to find out that you could only do this on a computer not on your phone or iPad, and that the service fee is not refundable because it was already more than 48 hours when I made the booking. I felt extremely frustrated because it said nowhere when I made the booking that the service fee is non-refundable after 48 hours. Literally a ripoff and a scam.

But really the worst was when we went to bed. After some minutes we realized the smell, and then it dawned on us that we were sleeping in very used sheets/bed covers/pillow cases. The next day we reported it to the owner, by Whatsapp, and he came and removed the rug, and attempted to change the linen, but he is a young lawyer, and had never changed a bed in his lifetime, so my wife ended up doing it.",4,christian of Argentina

On a Sunday night, host had a party until 4 a.m. in which all the Airbnb guests stood in the hallway asking him to turn the music down. I moved out 1 week early and requested a full refund of unused days and supplied pictures of my issues.

We told the host we would not be arriving until around midnight. He said no problem, just call when we got there and he would provide us a code to get in the door. When we arrived in Jersey City at midnight, I called Jason (the host) and got no answer. The neighborhood seems very sketchy. I had to call 5 or 6 times before he answered and gave us a code. We got into the place and it was about 95 degrees maybe more. There was no A/c in the apartment as described in the ad. There was 2 towels for 2 guys who were staying for 4 nights.

1278,"We reserved an Airbnb in Washington DC about 10 months before trip. While travelling, Airbnb cancelled our booking about 1 week prior to that visit... Reason? Because the house owner was not complying, with their rules... They were warned 3 times... Did not comply so were taken off the site. Instead of penalizing the apartment themselves they actually penalised us more as we are stuck with nowhere to stay. The American office then emailed us to give us other choices of accommodation then booked it for us. We are Canadian so unknowingly they booked it in US dollars without telling us. That was a natural mistake as the agent didn't even think of that. But for us it meant another 30% increase. Their office would not do anything, even was going to penalise us for cancelling.

They have a very poor interface with your local government, and when something goes wrong will not warn you in advance. Instead, they'll just cancel all your upcoming visitors. That'll BE your notice that something has gone wrong. You'll have to email your local government to find out what the actual problem is, because Airbnb's tech isn't good enough to determine the problem and convey it to you.

They are a website and nothing else. Many other Real Estate sites to choose from with the same properties that don't rob customers and then hide from their Customer Service responsibility.

It was very obvious that the woman who stayed there over the weekend threw a party that got out of hand. We submitted pictures and invoices to Airbnb letting them know the damages and proof of what we paid in repairs. Airbnb declined to hold the woman accountable and/or help us to cover any of the costs themselves, with no explanation why. Since then, I’ve decided that the risk of allowing strangers to stay in my home is too risky when the company who is supposed to protect your home doesn't do the right thing.

Once we crossed this hurdle, I won't deny that your teams did try to assist us in finding listings we had already found on our own many times over (you have a very big staff, I may have spoken to more than half of them).

I again reiterated that these were 1-2 night stays. AirBnB responded that I had agreed to 10% discount for customers"".

Bank of America says Airbnb has to do a chargeback to retrieve the money and then refund to the correct card. Airbnb wrote that they DO NOT DO CHARGEBACKS. It is how their system is set up.

1290,"I am both a guest and host. For the most part Airbnb has been a good experience. However I have found they did not protect their hosts. I'm guessing maybe due to who pays them. I clearly offered a strict nonsmoking condo. My guest stayed 2-3 weeks and smoked inside the condo the entire time, to the point the cleaning crew went twice after their stay to try and remove the strong odor of cigarette smoke. In addition I had to change all filters, and clean any fabric, curtains, sofa, chairs, rugs, etc. that absorbed smoke.

I told them the changes had been made before I was locked out and the account is now set up and working. I have had no reply from them.

When we contacted the site about this issue and how unsafe it was they did nothing about it. The host refused to refund any of the money even though we did not stay at cabin. I asked the site to look into this and they choose not to listen to me. The host called me a liar and said that any vehicle could make it to the location. I am out over $700 with no help from the site. It took them over 2 weeks to respond to my claim. The initial email that they sent me said that they would have it resolved in 72 hours.

1297,"Airbnb sends email reminder to review your stay, which is good but misleading. My email reminder was ""Sep 14 is the last day you can review your stay..."" I went on to review the stay only to realize I couldn't. I called customer service & after speaking to 3 persons I then was told that it's at the time you checked out that your review was until then 14 days after. Yes I knew was 14 days after but had no clue was the time of checkout. Had I known this or if the email was clearly stated I could have review on time cause the homeowners were very great with us during our stay. The email reminder should had stated more clearly since that was the main purpose. As with any other company, the date I expected was at the end of the day. My intention was to give a 5 star review for the stay.",4,"Neil of South Richmond Hill, NY"
1298,"I recently stayed at an Airbnb property in Hong Kong. When I arrived, the floor was had noticeable shards of glass across the floor, the kitchen has roaches and bathroom had other bugs, washing machine was broken, kitchen door handle kept falling off, shower knob fell off and place was just dirty overall. I worked with a case manager at Airbnb who promised me a refund on the phone after the stay was over. After the stay ended, I contacted Airbnb and they basically said that they never agreed to anything at all despite the apartment was in violation of safety and cleanliness Airbnb policies.",4,"Jason of Chestnut Hill, MA"
1299,"Airbnb is a terrible customer service experience. They told my guest they will refund them without my permission. They had the guest occupy the space, agreed to the guest’s unreasonable request to get refunded and forcibly took money from my account. What did guest bring as an excuse? That the place wasn’t empty of my personal belongings. Like ** grow up and know this is a house not a hotel. Take your cheap ** to the hotel. Airbnb customer care is pure ** people with no appreciation that they are making money out of other people property. They believe they are obligated to issue refund and it is all at the cost of the host. I certainly like to sue them for this and love to get advice on how to do so. Customer care never responds and always promises to call you back but never does.",4,"Hami of Chicago, IL"
1300,Refused to re-issue a refund to updated payment method. Refund is in limbo from the merchant to the bank ping-ponging back-and-forth and Airbnb refused to put the refund on the new payment method or mail us a check. They left in my face and refused to let me speak to a supervisor.,4,"Andrea of Palm Bay, FL"
1301,"Posted your letter along with my response to our Facebook account and to our FOX NEWS affiliates in D.C. Our hope is that tens of thousands of Airbnb users will be as enraged by your flagrant violation and use of personal information as we are. Needless to say, it is doubtful we'll never hear from you. After all, we are the Deplorables and you are the all knowing, the elitists... called to correct our ignorant ways.",4,"Rob of Tampa, FL"
1302,Just saw a story on the local news where Airbnb double booked another family. Thought I would share my story. They did the same thing to me back in Colorado this past June 2018. Never bothered to tell me the house had been double booked. Only way I found out was I saw credit on my credit card statement and I called. Neither Airbnb or host bothered to call and tell me. I had one month to scramble to try to find another house that accepted 2 dogs and everything was booked. I finally found one. No thanks to Airbnb and all they offered was $25 off. This company sucks and I will never do business with them again.,4,"Tanya of Bay City, TX"
1303,"I signed up to be a host -- had to cancel (in plenty of time) due to extenuating circumstances. The guest was fine with it. Airbnb charged me $100, and it was totally unclear when I canceled that this charge would later be levied. This is a very shady company and I would recommend not doing business with them.",4,"Cal of Syracuse, NY"
1304,"Absolutely the WORST company I've ever dealt with. When our host kicked us out for even daring to call Airbnb due to discrepancies in his listing, as well as having his wife verbally harass and threaten us, Airbnb did absolutely nothing. Completely unhelpful. They did give us a refund and an extra $40 but, at that point, everything in the area was booked or was 300+ a night. They didn't help us find another place to stay, leaving us without a home in Vancouver (we had to sit at the airport for 5 hours, refreshing the page to find another host), and only made matters worse by deciding to contact the wife AFTER we had expressed our concern for our safety. ",4,"Rebekah of Boise, ID"
1305,"After staying at the Airbnb quite frequently while I was still looking for a permanent place in the new place I have moved to I started noticing that they will do ""anything"" to keep their business going. 1. They are not allowing any guest to stay continuously in a best ranked homes so that their service fee will add up. 2. They are not checking or validating the safety of the homes and they claim that they are not responsible for any unsafe condition of the homes in the listing. ",4,"Anitha of Charlotte, NC"
1306,"My family and I with three kids aged between 1 and 8 years arrived to this ""resort"" yesterday. Immediately we noticed how ruined down the place was. Nothing like the pictures. We decided to walk around and see the rest of the facilities, the family pool in particular breaks any health and safety regulation, I have never seen anything like this before. So, the pool is located next to a drop of at least 50 meters, the edge of the pool (where your kids are meant to walk while playing) has nothing dividing the edge and the pool. If anyone falls into that drop someone will get seriously hurt. Having seen this we decided not to stay.",4,"Jorge of Great Britain, Other"
1307,"When arriving at the Airbnb in London, the room was still not cleaned at the check in time. I let the owner know and he said the maid said it was cleaned but I was there and it was not; towels on the floor, bed with dirty linens, completely not cleaned. 30 min. Later still no maid and no clean room, so I left letting the owner know I was leaving not to return. I did not receive a complete refund because they say I didn't cancel and I didn't have proof of the dirty room. This was my first attempt with Airbnb and my last.",4,"Laura of Charlottesville, VA"
1308,"We had booked a place to stay but had to cancel within 24 hours of making the booking because a few guests that were coming with us had to pull out. The terms and conditions stated we would be given a full refund in circumstances where bookings were cancelled within 48 hours. It has been four weeks later, four phone calls to Airbnb's customer service and several attempts to contact them on their feedback page but without luck. We are getting increasingly frustrated that the deposit has not been refunded, but what is worse is that the staff at Airbnb don't care. Terrible terrible terrible! Will never use again and advise you to do the same.",4,Steven of Australia
1309,I spent a lot of time finding and booking a condo. The host asked a silly question that I did not immediately respond to because I was busy. The host canceled my reservation because I did not immediately respond to his stupid question.,4,"Nancy of Golden, CO"
1310,"We have used Airbnb a lot in the past, but this time it was disgusting. Often, Airbnb rentals can be good - but more frequently than it should be, the rentals are not clean. In this case the sheets smelled, and there was visible hair - from the previous renter. We came in late, and Italy was having a heat wave; previously, my wife had gotten heat stroke, so we were just exhausted. So we did not report it to Airbnb right away. Since we waited, Airbnb refuses to help us. Kim, in their customer support department, is not sympathetic at all.",4,"Kevin of Campbell, CA"
1311,"I referred another host to Airbnb before I had sufficient experience with their customer disservice department. I was promised in writing a $300 referral fee. This promise appeared on my referral page. All of the customer service people have stated that I am either an idiot or a liar and that this was only a progress bar. The notification on my page said you will receive your money in 15 business days not that my money was pending. Then after complaining to a customer service rep who denied I was entitled to the money I received an email saying, ""Don't lose hope refer another host to get a referral fee."" Having been defrauded one time why would I try it again? There is no way to directly contact the actual department that handles problems.",4,"Erica of Brooklyn, NY"
1312,"I booked a room on Airbnb in Brooks, Maine. It said a ""loft"" on a farm. What I found was a dilapidated run down farmhouse with an attic space. A broken down fridge on the back porch, a door with a missing window pane and a filthy kitchen with piles of clothes. The room was almost 90 degrees so I turned on the a/c that was in the room. It blew out cold in front and hot in the back. It was a sauna. So I call Airbnb after speaking to our nonexistent hosts. What did I get - ""Well you should have taken pics."" I said it was 9 pm and I took pics of the room temperature and how the ""loft"" had no privacy door - forget a lock. ",4,"Graciela of Jackson, WY"
1313,I had to cancel my vacation and no longer will need Airbnb accommodations. I canceled within the 48 hrs of cancellation policy and the host is refusing to give me a full refund. The host is not honoring the 48 hrs cancellation and full refund policy.,4,"Maris of Boca Raton, FL"
1314,"We rented a home in an area near Omaha Nebraska. It looked very nice. The basement was storage and off limits. No problem, we paid hundreds of dollars for four nights and yay! In the first ten minutes we figure out the basement is inhabited by a drunk guy who does maintenance. He left the basement door ajar weaving his truck past our car in the driveway to get away then drove up and down the street. Really scary when he parked pointed into the backyard. Got pictures of piles of booze bottles etc. ",4,"walter of Mesa, AZ"
1315,"As of this writing Airbnb and one of their partner hosts, Jacks Realty in West Palm Beach, Fl. have not refunded my money amounting to near $1,600. I booked a rental which turned out to be a health hazard and death trap which is typical of a slumlord type property. We could not stay in the place as it was so unfit and had to find a hotel in the area. I sent many photos as proof of my claim and Airbnb ignored them. The unit was not fit for human habitation and to say the least not as advertised. The property had just been fumigated with signs posted as warnings to occupants.",4,"Ronald of Palm Beach Gardens, FL"
1316,Airbnb gave one of my guests a 50% refund - without my permission - because two hornets came into the property. The reason given was that I had not disclosed in advance that an animal was present. Hosts should be aware that Airbnb can refund with no good reason. I will be taking legal advice.,4,Caroline of US
1317,Nothing but terrible experiences with Airbnb and their “services.” To say the least this company has poor customer service and does not take any responsibility for any mishaps that occur at their venues. They don’t care about their customers whatsoever or the fact that the places they post on their site could be a scam. They don’t check out any of the venues they post on their site to see if they are legit and meet their standards. ,4,Erin of USA
1318,"I had made a reservation at an Airbnb in Quincy, IL. When I got to the place it was filthy dirty. I took about 50 pictures of the place, then sent a note to the host that I would not be staying and also contacted Airbnb with the situation and sent them pictures. After 6 weeks of trying to get my money back nothing has happened except for me getting the run around from Airbnb. The bedroom garbage can was full, bed looked like it was slept in. The towel and wash rags they left in my room for use we’re all stained green and yellow. ",4,"Vicki of Usa, USA"
1319,"I have book a home to stay with my family of 5 in Canada but after 2 weeks we have found mice in home and inform Airbnb about it. They cancelled our staying home agreement without relocating us somewhere else. Actually recommended us a place 2000 mm always where we stayed. (Recommended from Ontario to Nova Scotia by a case manager, which I have proof in my email).",4,"Veysel of Usa, USA"
1320,"We booked a home through Airbnb and paid the required amount. The next day payment was canceled by Airbnb and we were asked to contact customer service. We did so and the customer service staff we talked to was unfriendly and unprofessional. He did not give us enough details as to why the payment was canceled, especially after it had gone through flawlessly 24 house earlier with the same house. Clearly there was a glitch at their end, but once confronted, they did not give any satisfactory answer and instead canceled the account. As far as we are concerned, they don't have decent customer service skills. They need a lot of improvement and training on basic human service.",4,"E. of Nairobi, Other"
1321,"I rented a boat (a 1980 Chris Craft) at the Jersey Shore (Wildwood, NJ). When we first arrived the boat was not was we expected it to be. However, I was ready for the adventure and was willing to overlook the lack of basic necessities as a result. But as time when on, we discovered there were many problems with the boat, for example we had no running water for the first week we were there, the host did not empty the commode from the previous guest prior to our arrival as he told me he still needed to do that (we arrived a day late so he had plenty of time to do this). It was more than a week after we arrived that he finally tended to the toilet and only after we complained of the stench on the boat as a result. ",4,"Cindy of Philadelphia, PA"
1322,"Customer Service is unhelpful and degrading. Had an issue with a service they provided, which was a clear violation of their terms and policies, but the customer service agents failed to recognize it. And after several messages, just stopped responding. Seems like they will say anything to get out of actually providing real help.",4,"Benjamin of Los Angeles, CA"
1323,"We have used Airbnb for the first time. We booked an apartment in Prague in August 2018. We were happy with the apartment... nice and clean, well equipped and quite central. Metro station, supermarkets and various restaurants at walking distance. The hosts were very helpful before we arrived at the apartment. However, things changed drastically once we arrived there. The apartment was so hot! We were fully aware that there was no air conditioning in the apartment and it happened to be a heatwave. So, we asked for two extra big fans (or at least one more) as there was only one small fan since the apartment was simply unbearable to stay in. ",4,"Kenneth of L-Imtarfa, Other"
1324,On 24 July I requested a booking for 7 days with Airbnb. It was refused by the owner but AU $400 was still deducted from my PayPal account. Airbnb promised (by email) a refund within 7 days. Today is August 14 and still no refund. Any suggestions as to a course of action?,4,"Dianne of Paradise Waters, Other"
1325,"First of all I’m sure there are amazing things about Airbnb, I was just unfortunate and didn’t have a great experience! We booked a stay through Airbnb for my dad's 50th birthday... the information included “sleeps 8 and has 3 bedrooms”. You could clearly see two rooms had queen beds, but then the 3rd looked like two twins beds. The host confirmed that it was twin beds, so I assumed (it sleeps 8) there must be a pull out couch. Thinking two couples could stay in the queen rooms, we could sleep on the pull out couch and my toddler (age 2) could sleep in the room with two twin beds.",4,"Caitlin of Gander, NL"
1326,"Rude and unreliable. You might get lucky and have a good experience but you lose your hard earned money if you are not. Airbnb doesn’t take responsibility of an ill maintained home. Don’t go for it. I ended up in a listing where my father and I got sick within an hour of getting in because it smelled so bad, old and dusty. There was evidence of rodent infestation and the host sounded pretty unapologetic about it! I had to leave and go to a hotel. Upon contacting Airbnb they said since I didn’t give the host “a chance to fix the issues” I won’t be given any refund. Like, how can you fix the first impression of a guest who sees a book eaten at the corner by a rodent in a home you paid for?! Doesn’t it imply that you don’t maintain the house like you should have and now that you are caught, you want to try covering up? I didn’t get my money back - my hard earned money, but I am writing the review so that it can help at least one person!",4,"Piya of Column, OH"
1327,"When I was looking to book a stay, Airbnb's website said I would not be charged at booking, which I wanted because I wanted to pay in cash. Well, I was charged. I canceled right away thinking I did something wrong, re-booked, and was charged a second time. I kept the second reservation. I also noticed I did not receive my $40 credit for being referred. My referring friend did not receive her $20 credit either. I tried contacting Airbnb which is a complete JOKE!!! If you're fluent in English, expect to not receive a fluent speaking associate if they even feel like returning your call at all. I was told my account has been activated for 2 years therefore, I was not eligible for a credit. ",4,"Sarah of Sheffield Lake, OH"
1328,"When booking rentals through Airbnb. There isn't any explanations about the ""type"" cancellation your HOST has on their property, until you cancel, then that is when you find out WHAT TYPE you have on your stay. The site doesn't say 50% of the TOTAL RENTAL FEE DUE (even though you may have only paid the 1/2 that is required to hold your reservation), it just says 50% refund. Airbnb site also says cleaning fees are ALWAYS refunded, but that hasn't been the case either. VERY DISAPPOINTED in this as to I had 2 separate reservations I just cancelled (1 was not my choice but the other was because of this situation), lost $981.70 (only refunded $12.77 of $875.40 reservation and $31.68 of $1088 reservation))!!! GUYS, this is so unfair!!! RIDICULOUS!!",4,"Wendy of Alexandria, AL"
1329,"I booked an apartment in Toronto on July 6, for six days in August. My account was charged for half the amount of the rental. Without notification, my reservation was cancelled. I only learned of this when I checked the Airbnb website yesterday, a few days before check in. I contacted Airbnb Customer Service, and after several attempts, I spoke to a representative. The representative said the host had cancelled (the host said Airbnb had cancelled). There was no explanation as to why, or why I hadn't been contacted. The representative said she was sending the file to a case manager in her group and I would hear from them. I haven't heard anything, even though I have followed up with the representative twice. Because it is so close to check in, it cost me 40% more to book a comparable apartment. Airbnb doesn't take responsibility for anything---it should be regulated the way hotels are. They should be accountable.",4,"Robert of Seattle, WA"
1330,"I am currently visiting England from the US. Today, I found out that due to a “glitch” in their system Airbnb has cancelled my accommodations for tomorrow. I am now in a foreign country with no place to stay. I spent ALL day on the phone with them and they do completely admit it’s their fault. The case managers and supervisor said they were going to call me back and then they never did. They insisted on corresponding only through messaging on their app and would just stop responding. This has been an awful experience and after 6 hours they just texted me a $100 coupon. As if that could possibly make up for what they’ve done. I will NEVER use Airbnb again.",4,"Erin of Philadelphia, PA"
1331,"Wow! After $877.00 later, hours on the phone, lots of correspondence with the Airbnb Caseworker, who can’t even seem to figure out how many days we actually booked or what actually happened, I’m amazed at the incompetence. I took photos of everything to prove our case. The place looked nothing like the photos and had not been kept up or maintained at all. Airbnb is not even able to negotiate with the host on behalf of a 5 star rated guest with Vacasa, a real estate company who is listing on Airbnb as a “host” who is mismanaging 91 thousand properties as stated by the host when we contacted them immediately upon arrival to the nightmare location. In all our years of traveling the world, we’ve never experienced anything like it. ",4,"Lydia of Flowery Branch, GA"
1332,"I have usually been satisfied by the accommodations from Airbnb. Not this time. We were located close to the California town of Visalia. After a long drive, we checked in (Airbnb near Sequoia National Park). To our horror, the air conditioning was not working, and it was 100 degrees outside. Fortunately, they fixed it partially the next day. But then a swarm of ants and many mice greeted us. We left the place early. Clearly the home was not maintained at all. If you can't find a park lodge to live in, don't go at all. The distances are long and the Airbnb homes are not habitable.",4,"Godfrey of Long Beach, CA"
1333,"I tried to cancel a reservation I made for Sept 28-30 in Worcester, Ma. I could not find the reservation or easily find a phone number for Airbnb. After three phone call and half an hour I finally found a person who would send me an email confirming that there was no reservation.",4,"John of Wilton, CT"
1334,"As their new update policy, they force us to accept it and upload our government issued ID for identity verification. But they do not mention how they can protect our ID from being stolen. I don't believe they have this ability. Besides, including Amazon and any other website, no one ever requires government ID, they should not have the right to do so. It's unfair policy for customers. Thus, I canceled my account, and I will tell all my family and friends to cancel theirs as well.",4,"YANG of Fleming Island, FL"
1335,"July 2018, a group of ladies booked an Airbnb in Atlanta. The place was unclean and in a less than desirable location. Upon calling the host and getting nowhere we contacted airbnb and reported the condition of the unit and expressed our concerns. After many phone calls back and forth we ended up at the Marriott and Airbnb did absolutely nothing for us. I would NOT recommend this business to anyone as it seems they back the hosts but do nothing for the patrons.",4,"Paula of Clarksville, TN"
1336,"Guest showed up late, locked herself out and refused to take a full refund and go someplace else. Guest trashed me and the place and claimed things completely false or lies with the exception except perhaps in brain, obviously with issues! Airbnb had photos and confirmation of issues and FAILED any conflict resolution! Airbnb allowed a FALSE review to stand and then decided to ban me from their program when ""Safety and Security"" decided they did not want to deal with my persistence and disappointment in delayed payments!",4,"Sue of Kalamazoo, MI"
1337,"I recently booked a reservation for a September trip to my hometown in Michigan, a trip I take yearly with my mother and my sister, all of us flying in from different locations. I used the 48-hour-cancel-for-free filter, and upon receiving the street address to the reserved listing, my 83-year-old mother determined the location was unfortunately too far from downtown for her to be able to walk to & from. So I cancelled this reservation within the 48 hours of having booked it and booked a different (and much more expensive) listing closer to downtown. To my surprise, my 48-hour-cancel-for-free refund did not include the $160.95 service fee, which I took to be a clear error on Airbnb’s part, as nowhere on their 48-hour-cancel-for-free filter is it specified that the service fee is non-refundable.

1338,"First time user of Airbnb. HORRIBLE experience. Cannot recommend and will never reuse. Completed online registration. Booked room. Owner writes back that, ""I am not comfortable with you."" Taken aback as I was listed as ""verified"" by Airbnb, and he didn't KNOW me so how could he be uncomfortable with me? Then, searched the city to which we were traveling again. Booked. Only AFTER booking do I see that it isn't in the city I was searching but about 30 miles outside the city. Troubled by the fact that the company allows listing outside the listed destination to come up, but learned my lesson. Canceled the reservation without incident.",4,"Devon of Tampa, FL"

We have a medical situation where our toddler granddaughter needs surgery, it is a have to for her health, we have to travel to Columbus Ohio in September, so we asked to cancel, Mr ** said it was not a reason to qualify for a refund. We canceled 2 months early, he can easily rerent the condo in Gulf Shores, Al. We were told there won't be a refund. That's not right, we were told to expect a refund the 26th of July, now today they said no refund. Airbnb refund policy is very unfair, be careful using this company, if something comes up, you will lose your money.

1340,"I have to say, I am very disappointed with AIRBNB service as on 3 occasions, host has canceled my bookings which were made several weeks ago.

1341,"As a new Airbnb user, I had some difficulty with two bookings. I had to cancel and rebook. I did rebook and followed thru with the booking. They counted those cancellations against me. My family had me book a family get together and when one of the grandsons was unable to come, they asked me to cancel the reservation. It was expensive. I talked to the homeowner, when I did the booking, explaining that I would cancel, if necessary, within a week, so that he would not lose the opening. When I cancelled, Airbnb charged me a significant amount of money.",4,"Susan of Truth Or Consequences, NM"
1342,"Tried to book a property in Halifax with Monica. Never received booking confirmation so I moved on and booked a hotel. Four days later I see an Airbnb charge on my account for $1476. Note: cancellation policy is 48 hours and 50% refund. However, it is impossible to cancel a booking in 48 hours if you don't have it. Airbnb tells me I have 2 accounts and verified confirmation email was sent. Email they sent had invalid address ending in .ccom. They probably received unable to deliver notice.",4,"Jerry of New Braunfels, TX"

1344,"Airbnb has no idea what a homeowner has to do in order to keep the home in perfect condition for the next client. And they do not care. As long as they advertise your property and take the money. My personal contract for our beach house clearly states that trashing the house or backyard is unacceptable and carries extra fees for cleaning. However, if you ever got your house or backyard dirty and trashed, to a point that it needs double time for the cleaning service to make it ready for the next client, you cannot get any extra payment - Airbnb claims that since there is no physical damage, they do not charge extra. On top of that, the communications from their agent are sharp, negative and totally inappropriate. My tenants had the backyard full of beer cans for 2 full days, and we had to clean it on Sunday. On my expense. I HAVE TAKEN MY PROPERTY OFF THEIR LIST. We have other agencies we work with who appreciate our business.",4,"Lia of Bethesda, MD"
1345,"I had an account years ago that I used with no problem. I tried to log in today to find accommodations in Charleston, SC. The AirBNB site insisted I verify my account and suggested I do so through my cell phone. When I downloaded the phone app, the site wanted permission to access my contacts. REALLY!!?? For what possible legitimate purpose? No other booking site has ever asked me for that kind of access. The next step in the process would have been to send a copy of the front & back of my driver's license, passport or visa. I DON'T THINK SO!!! Can you spell: ""Identification theft""??? Message to President, Chairman of the Board, and CFO of AirBNB: ""I'll send you that information on myself right after you send me the same information on yourselves!"" Sorry AirBNB hosts. No business from my household!",4,"Suzanne of Huntersville, NC"

1347,"We showed up at this Airbnb house at 805 Red Oak Lane, Arlington, TX, 76012. When we arrived, the AC is totally non functional. It was 85 degrees downstairs and approximately 95 degrees upstairs. A sweatbox. The outside AC unit/compressor hadn't been serviced or cleaned in years as was evidenced by the build up of dirt around the vented metal panel that allows access to the capacitors. The maintenance people who showed up to fix the problem had to dig 3-5 inches down in the dirt just to get the door off because of years of erosion. ",4,"Jeff of Fortson, GA"
1348,"The reason for the review is because we have been given vague and elusive behind account block. On 7/24/2018 we reverified our identities and we were reassured that once the transmittal from SSA was received funds would be available immediately. We received no notification or account alert of any ""unusual activity"" unless they count the numerous logins the past 72 hours. Who does not check their account constantly when bills are due. We received creditor extensions due to a security breach at our previous bank. This account ending card ending in ** had always been a mere back up account.",4,"ROBERT of Keller, TX"
1349,Unpractical refund/cancellation policy. If canceled within 14 business days and owner is able to rent the unit refunds should be given. How is it that you have strict cancellation policy that only allows a consumer to cancel within 48 hours for a full refund when booked 3 months in advance. It’s best to use Airbnb for short notice hotel reservations. Otherwise you are screwed if owner decide to implement “strict refund policy” and will not accommodate unforeseen circumstances! I’ll stick with hotels going forward! Airbnb app DELETED!!!,4,"Shany of Houston, TX"

I contacted Airbnb and after taking down my information I was told I would be refunded. When I asked how this would have happened, seeing as how I have no payment options saved on my account and my card hadn’t been compromised. I was told they would only release that information under government subpoena. I’m deleting my account.",4,"Matthew of Krestova, BC"
1351,"I found recently especially that as a traveler, you feel intense pressure to only give, at worse, a lukewarm review or none at all. A few things everyone should know... your credit card is ""held hostage"" by Airbnb up to 2 weeks after your stay, in case host wants to accuse you of damages. How do we know they won't come up with some made-up problem if they don't like your review? I currently am debating on how to review a host who I can tell from prior reviews takes GREAT offense at ANY negative comments or suggestions. ",4,"Jane of Carlsbad, CA"

I spoke with Toni only to find that this company only confers with email!!! My information can only be expedited and someone will email me!!! Really?? How can this company stay in business??? I have barely seen any good reviews. This business is nothing but a fraud!!!,4,"Audrey of Staten Island, NY"
1353,"What you are about to read you most likely will not believe. This is truly a script for a movie. This is my firsthand experience with not just Airbnb but many life lessons in a very short amount of time. I hope this helps at least 1 person. In mid-June 2018, I decided to relocate from Northern New Jersey to the Palm Beach County area in Florida. The past year and half I experienced the loss of my father on January 11, 2017, the loss of my mother on January 2, 2018, job loss, fighting for unemployment for months, fighting for jobs, fighting to save my apartment and not get evicted for 8 months straight, having my entire network hacked by a family member who destroyed my business that I put years into building, attacked me in front of my mother 4 days before she went into open-heart surgery... the list goes on.",4,"M. of Hackensack, NJ"
1354,"I had 4 charges come out of my account this week and this is day 3 of calling Airbnb and being told their fraud department would call me to take care of this and no one has called. When I call the company they won't even talk to me without me giving them the last 4 digits of my debit card. I will not give them this information - I just had fraud committed on my account, why would I give them more financial information. I just spent another hour on the phone with Sheldon and Arvie and I not absolutely no help. Very sure I will never use this company again.",4,"Cindy of Goldendale, WA"
1355,"I rented out my apartment to a guest. He broke a bed. I gathered the evidence that Airbnb required, they agreed to pay. They then rescinded their offer, no explanation. They also kept the damage/breakages insurance from the guest. That seems like fraud to me? Do not trust Airbnb.",4,"Stephen of Stratford Upon Avon, Other"
1356,"After reading the 15-- 5 Star post and that the host was a Superhost we decided to Rent 911 Riverview Drive, Bullhead City for 4 nights. In the info pack that was sent we were told that the a/c was to be set to 75 degrees prior to our arrival- home was 96 degrees and a/c was off and it took from 5:30 in the evening until 11:30 at night to get temp down to a balmy 88. There were ants in the house, the flooring was torn out in the Kitchen, dining, living and bedrooms and basically a poorly stained and not very clean concrete floor. The oven (see photo) was one of the dirtiest we have ever come across (also the dishes- see photo) so we fixed no meals at the house (one of the reasons you rent a vacation rental). ",4,"Ron of Temecula, CA"
1357,"I booked 3 nights stay with Airbnb in Florida. We stayed at an addition room from the main house, which is the owner live. The host is a nice man, no complaints! The reasons that I am writing this review is about Airbnb. We could not sleep on the first night because of the constant noises from the window ac in the unit, and from the ac condenser on the roof above the unit. We could hear the feel the vibration for the whole night. We tried to turn off the ac unit off, but it was too hot. We decided to leave on the next morning because it will ruin our vacation for the sleepless nights. We contacted the host to let him know our decision and left. We contacted Airbnb to ask for the refund of the remaining nights. They refused and claimed it was our fault to leave. If you are not happy with the products or services, it is our right to refuse to pay, although we were willing to pay for the first sleepless night! Airbnb just lost one customer!",4,"Loc of Garden Grove, CA"
1358,"Reserved a place in Seattle two months ago for a trip that is now two weeks away. Got an email yesterday (less than two weeks from planned trip) saying that my background check didn't go through because of a criminal record. I have no criminal record. Needless to say I disputed it through the background check company they use and it was a simple mistake, same name, birthday and state, different person completely. They reversed their background check within two hours and my background check came back clean. ",4,"Joshua of Tallahassee, FL"
1359,"We just stayed in the Palmer House in New Orleans. One of the beds was infested with wood beetles. We told our Super Host and she told us “they won’t bother you”. She never said “sorry” or “what can I do to make this right."" What she did say was let me sweep up the sawdust pile the beetles left on the floor. The couple staying in that room slept on the floor the next night. The next day when she saw the air mattress the floor she let us know “that we are from the north and just don’t understand bugs."" Not even an offer to get an exterminator in. Following Airbnb policy, we notified them when the issue happened. They notified the landlord and she promptly ordered us out of her lovely home. She even threatened to call the police. ",4,"Vicki of Medina, OH"
1360,Airbnb is the most unprofessional and rude business that I ever came across in my entire life. They cancel people's reservations without advised them and without their approval. They like to spin and span their customers as they're pleased. They cancelled our reservations few days before our vacation to Italy. They were trying to get me for more money and give me different places. Of course a lot more expensive. I would urge you to stay away from these crooked people and please spread the word and let good people know how bad is Airbnb organization. ,4,"Nino of Gilroy, CA"
1361,I am very upset and angry with the host referral programme. I have invited 4 hosts. And I have helped them to create their account. I gave a lot of time and effort. They have promised 250 for each hosts and gave only 86 euro for the first 2. And for the other 2 they told me the hosts I referred did not used the link I have sent while I am the one who clicked the links and create the accounts to help them. I really hope developers will create a new and ethical platform for hosts.,4,"Gözde of Athens, Other"
1362,"I changed my phone number 3 years ago. Went to login into Airbnb account and from my computer and it said it had to verify my identity by sending me a text to my old phone number. Then locked me out of the account because I don't have that phone. No way to update phone number. No way to contact customer service because account is locked and they cannot be contacted without an account. Contacted them with a new account I created and the only response I got was an apology for how I ""felt"" but they apparently refuse to solve the problem or update the phone number. Two weeks have passed. Nothing. Apparently they are so profitable that servicing their paying customers is no longer a necessity.",4,"Gary of Seattle, WA"
1363,"Booked an Airbnb in Los Angeles CA a month before my vacation. My family flew into Las Vegas from MD then drove to Los Angeles, a four hour drive. An hour prior to our arrival the host sends a text stating there are issues with the apartment. He suggests another one of his properties but is smaller that has only has 1 bedroom. The property we originally booked was a 2 bedroom. We opted for another property with a different host. Arrived at the newly booked property and apartment was not as listed. Listing stated king bed in one bedroom, was actually a queen and the other bedroom was listed as a queen, was actually a full bed. Wasn’t impressed with the unit but tried to make it work. ",4,"Kathy of Millersville, MD"
1364,"I stayed in a house of an extremely conservative Christian Republican. It was so creepy. I think he had the house bugged and he listened to my conversations although I cannot prove it. He was just ok until he heard me without my knowledge having a conversation with my gay boyfriend. Ever since he stopped talking to me and that made me feel so scared. I thought he was going to kick me with guns and everything. But fortunately, he just ignored me which was good. I don't want to be his friend anyway. But my point is that I felt so anxious and stressed because I didn't know if he was going to act violent or what. I was in the middle of nowhere. I didn't have any motel or neighbors nearby. I wouldn't stay in Airbnb anymore. Just going to a stranger house is scary and you don't know what you are going to get, because the reviews are not always accurate.",4,"Pepito of New Bedford, MA"
1365,"I'm a host, Air b and ** is forcing me to take all kinds of people with bad reviews. If I don't take them they penalize me by not showing my property when people search, or they fine me money. Disgusting company. They forcing me to host bad people who don't respect my place or other guests.",4,"James of London, Other"
1366,"I've been trying to book an Airbnb for a night in Monterey, CA. Yes, it is a busy weekend and prices are at a premium. But it's the property owner's responsibility to do their own research on pricing. TWICE now I've booked a home and the price has been changed to a much higher rate - it's a bait and switch. The first time, I was TYPING IN MY CREDIT CARD NUMBER and the price TRIPLED while I was typing. Thank goodness I looked at the total one last time before I clicked to purchase. The second time, I booked and PAID FOR the home and got a confirmation and everything. An hour later, Airbnb contacted me and said the owner ""had a calendar mix up"" and now wanted to charge me double the rate I paid. I protested, but Airbnb cancelled my reservation, refunded my money and gave me a $25 coupon. Which I won't be using. I'll stick to hotels from now on, thanks.",4,"Maggie of Atascadero, CA"
1367,"I used Airbnb for the first time to book a BNB for a planned trip. Airbnb sent a message stating the ""host"" had accepted the booking and then proceeded to bill my credit card for the booking. I made contact with the ""host"" to finalize the details only to be told they knew nothing about me or my booking. They further stated that they had family issues and were not taking any bookings this year. I have made attempts to contact Airbnb but they have no direct contact available and their site tells me to contact the host for a refund. The host was not paid, and as stated knows nothing about a booking. I am still attempting to obtain a full refund, but Airbnb's site policy states a refund minus their handling fees if I can find out how to contact them. The booking should never have been made by them and their practice is deceitful. They state the booking was accepted, when the ""host"" was not even taking bookings.",4,"George of Anchorage, AK"
1368,"My mother signed up for Airbnb with a referral code I sent her. She accidentally entered her email as Gmail when it was another e-mail provider. They then changed the account appropriately but every time we tried to log in with her correct email/which they also had as correct on file it told her to please login with her “wrong email account.” The wrong email wouldn’t work either. There was no way to actually log into her account. We spent 2 hours on the phone Saturday, they route your call to Pakistan where the staff giggles at you under their breath and passively makes it harder to solve the problem (for which at heart they don’t want to fix and they find it funny because they hate westerners) and they just banter off the script and say I’m sorry Mr so and so over and over and I understand your frustration over and over.",4,"Joseph of Long Beach, CA"
1369,"I am one of the 10 guests that stayed on June 20 and June 21, 2018 at 4 Tchernihovski St. Tel Aviv Israel provided by Airbnb. It is private home with 3 separated units. When we arrived we found that the units are not as shown in the pictures, the bathrooms had mold, the T.V. did not work at any of the units, there was no hot water in the second unit. The water heater in the second unit was hanging in the bathroom from the ceiling above the sink which is great dangerous and most likely against building code.",4,"Yoel of Los Angeles, CA"
1370,"We were deceived by an Airbnb host. We wanted to find a place to stay in Niagara Falls, New York and entered that location in the search field of your website for the 7 of us. We looked at the results returned by the search criteria and located one we liked. We took a look at the property photos and description details and that's what convinced us to choose the property as well as the description stating how close it was to the falls. We knew the property had a strict cancelation policy and thought that wouldn't be an issue since we were not planning to change anything about our planned trip.",4,"Emad-ud-deen of Westford, MA"
1371,"My husband and I just recently rented a unit on South Beach Florida. We had some real concerns about our accommodations when we arrived. Definitely not up to par for the money we were paying. After contacting the host, with no response, I called Airbnb customer service. I was lucky enough to have Macie answer the phone. Macie became my case manager and what a great one she is! She contacted the host on our behalf and within thirty minutes there was a call from the host. I will say the Host was quite responsive on fixing some of our concerns. However, in order to correct the problems, we had many people in our pad fixing the problems. ",4,"Vicki of Glen Allen, VA"
1372,"I've used Airbnb at least 15 times but NEVER AGAIN. I've never been to New Orleans before and was so excited. Six of my girlfriends and I planned a fun weekend getaway. I booked us a house that listed as ""3 miles from French Quarter"" on Airbnb and paid over $1000 upfront (included $130 cleaning fee and $113 service fee and $45 tax fee).",4,"Karen of Davidson, NC"
1373,I am a business professional. I have recently had the most horrible experience with an organization that calls themselves Airbnb. Their customer service representatives are rude and they tell the customers not to be rude to them. In that they will hang up on them if they even raise their voice. They have absolutely no respect for their customers none whatsoever. They cancel reservations on their own not their host but on their own and keep your money for up to three or four weeks before it is refunded. This company actions are criminal. In this organization needs to be investigated by the US government. This is the worst company I have ever dealt with in my life. I have never been so offended by an organization ever in my entire life and I hope that the owners of this organization pray to the good Lord for their souls for their criminal actions against their own customers.,4,"Douglas of Clermont, FL"
1374,My husband and myself just had a horrible experience renting a place in Montreal Quebec through AirBNB. The pictures were lovely and the Host was a SuperHost meaning he had great reviews and verified by AirBNB. We found out from a person that works at an AirBNB office that someone could not have all those reviews since 2015. This was a scam artist that hacked into the system and is continuing to hack in as AirBNB keeps sending him or whoever money. We called the Host from the airport as arranged (as I had sent him arrival time previously through AirBNB) with the number AirBNB gave us and it went into some strange language. I tried texting the host who went by the name of Stephane but no response. ,4,"Carol of Shuniah, ON"
1375,"I booked and paid for a month stay in Colombia through Airbnb. The host contacted me 22 days before arriving and literally blackmailed me; if I did not paid her an extra $450 dollars, she would cancel my stay and leave me without a place to stay. I DID NOT paid her ransom and I asked AirB&B to cancel my reservation and return my funds so I could make new arrangements. They said they CANNOT cancel the reservation until the fraudulent host do it themselves, YES. ",4,"Santiago of Calgary, AB"
1376,"Had a horrible experience during our stay in Barcelona. We were victims of extortion and slander by our host who, out of nowhere, decided to accuse us of stealing from him and demanded compensation. We were completely shocked by his claims and reported him to Airbnb immediately. They were absolutely useless in mediating, especially given the seriousness of the situation. They even allowed him to give us a negative review. Needless to say, we will not be using Airbnb ever again! Once they have your money, they could care less about what happens.",4,"Hector of Minneapolis, MN"
1377,"So we’re from Canada and made Airbnb booking in Mission, BC. Contacted the host, she gave me a link where I can continue with my booking, paid for everything, our stay with them was great, very accommodating and nice people. But, the night before we’re going to check out I found out that we’re charged almost $1k for 8 nights. From the receipt that Airbnb sent me, it was only $600++, as I was speaking to their customer service agent they couldn’t figure out why I was charged $732 plus a pending transaction of $181. ",4,"Judy of Calgary, AB"
1378,"We had a 4 hour delay checking in because the host never answered, and the management took over four hours. Pressed for a review, I was honest, not mean or unreasonable. They never published my review, so I am unable to trust their reviews. Nothing is all positive.",4,"Ela of Enterprise, AL"
1379,"Recently I have had a very unexpected and disappointing experience using Airbnb. I made a booking to stay at a Airbnb in Seville, Spain, but my host cancelled the booking less than a week before our arrival. I did not receive any warning and only found out after logging in to check my Airbnb account. From their troubleshooting web page I was told I was to receive a credit voucher for my inconvenience but I never received any message or email as told on their website. When I went to book a new accommodation, all the prices had on average doubled in price compared to my original booking. But when I went to the check out page when making a new booking, I was happy to see they automatically deducted a credit voucher and charged the difference. But later when I went to check my credit card statement, I was shocked to see they had made another charge without my knowledge. ",4,"Minli of Auckland, Other"
1380,"We showed up at dusk to the address. The host did not specify that there was an apartment A and B at the same address. And most of the pictures of the unit were of the outside of the upstairs apartment. We went to the upstairs unit, which was the only one you could see at that time of day. When we tried the door a dog barked at us. I thought we might have the wrong address and had the Uber driver take us what ended up being around the block, where we ended up at the same address. I finally noticed there was a downstairs. It was really dark down there (Sam does not leave the light on for you). I had to turn on my phone and all I could see was a key lock, not the key pad we needed to put in the code.",4,"D of Seabrook, TX"
1381,"TWICE I have had reservations cancelled for no reason. The first was when I was relocating for a job. I had a Jeep full of belongings, and the guy who took my money for the week suddenly refunded it before my arrival and took his home off the Airbnb market. The next time, a week after starting my job, the reservation was cancelled again with no notice. I called and spent 30 minutes on the phone with the company only to be told that my account was ""under investigation for privacy"" and that my reservation was ""pending"" even though it had been confirmed (and now showed cancelled). The rep had an accent that made much of what he said unintelligible and when I asked for a supervisor, I got more minutes of hold with no one ever coming to the phone. ",4,"James of Portage, WI"
1382,"In February 2018 I booked an entire home in Oceanside CA. for three nights July 12-15. Paid over $1,100.00! Need to put my home up for sale the end of April. No idea it would sell in five days. Purchased a new home. Move in date July 8th. Four days before Oceanside stay. Canceled my reservations the start of May. I only received a 50% refund. Cancellation policy confusing as reads - ""FULL REFUND IF CANCELLATION IS WITHIN 48 HOURS OF BOOKING AND AT LEAST 14 FULL DAYS PRIOR TO LISTING'S LOCAL CHECK IN TIME."" ",4,"Mary of Waddell, AZ"
1383,"I live near an Airbnb and they are cropping up all over the neighborhood. I feel like I live in a commercial district with prostitution and drugs coming into the neighborhood from all directions. Temporary renters are loud, smoke pot, have disruptive parties, bring in escorts in mini skirts and don't care about permanent homeowners. Unfamiliar cars are strewn through the streets and loud music blasts until late at night. My neighbor reported renters having sex in the backyard where her girl in Kindergarten was playing. ",4,"dave of Aurora, CO"
1384,"I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND AIRBNB TO ANYONE!!! I had made a reservation with someone who was supposedly ""quick at responding"" which she wasn't. She was out of the country and it took Airbnb a couple days to hear back from her. Like way to communicate with your guests about your property and services and other questions we had. Her and the 3100 employees of Airbnb couldnt simply answer any questions or concerns I had. They will give the runaround for weeks about any issues that you may have. ",4,"Torie of Marietta, GA"
1385,"Made a reservation on or around May 1st 2018, confirmed reservation with a reservation number (**) spoke with the apartment hostess, everything was in good standing, got a phone call from the host on May 22 asking me why I canceled reservation, I didn’t know my reservation was canceled, called Airbnb couldn’t get an answer on why they canceled my reservation, has a reservation for a flight I had to miss the flight cause there was no place to stay in Connecticut, could not get in contact with anybody from Airbnb finally spoke to someone today after flight was missed and was told I would receive an email from the TRUST AND SAFTEY Dept, no phone call no email nothing, they just cancelled my stay in Connecticut with out my knowledge, I was supposed to be in Connecticut for a wedding which I am apart of on June 2nd.

1386,will not use them again.,4,"Silo of Riverstone, Other"
1387,"Basically, I found an acupuncture needle on my bed. I was disgusted with the situation and asking for a refund. Too bad I didnt take the photo. Apparently, Airbnb didn't even bother investigate the issue to verify what I said, which I wouldn't mind as I swear every single word I said is true. They just simply denied the refund as I couldn't provided so called ""evidence""!!!",4,"Airbnb of Scarborough, ON"
1388,"I have several homes, and have hosted through Airbnb for several years. I have recruited other hosts, traveled using Airbnb, and have for many years spoken highly of Airbnb. BUT, now I have nothing good to say about the company. It started when I was out of town and a guest came carrying her bed bugs with her. Airbnb would have you believe that they have a policy on your property to help you if you have financial issues with a guest. This is a LIE.",4,"Allison of Okeechobee, FL"
1389,"I tried Airbnb a few times now, I don't like the time wasting of making a booking and then a host declines for no good reason, I was hoping it would be a good alternative to hotels as travel all the time, but I just booked a hotel instead of the unreliability of Airbnb.",4,"John of Select Or Enter, NH"
1390,"I first used Airbnb in April of 2017. I vacationed to Colorado and it went smooth and ideal. I left a positive review for the host and the host did the same for me. This was nice because after receiving a positive review, I was able to book instantly instead of waiting for owner to approve it. This came in handy for my next vacation, back to Colorado in April 2018 exactly one year later. I book a house for myself and 3 other guests (all of whom were also verified) in the middle of January 2018. I booked early in order to have a nice place to stay. Our flight left for Colorado on April 18th, 2018. ",4,"Justin of St. Petersburg, FL"
1391,"Airbnb is forcing my hand by having us stay at a property that is said to have MOLD, no fire alarms, broken items = UNLIVABLE CONDITIONS. The host, whose name I don’t know, who doesn’t even have a business website, and who is not very responsive says everything is fixed and that the review was fraudulent? Now a new review comes out yesterday stating there are still missing fire alarms, a leaky ceiling, and the worst of them... BED BUGS?!?!",4,"Crystal of Gilroy, CA"
1392,"I have used Airbnb to rent out my rooms not realizing that they are thieves. Airbnb stole money several times. I would host guests for four nights, guest will pay all the money, then Airbnb takes it all. I canceled two reservations due to family bereavement. I explained to Airbnb why I had canceled as I could not host the guests due to two family funerals. Airbnb promised to waived the cancellation and pay me back my money which they never did. Two more bookings were made, I clearly told the guest, I can not check you in coz Airbnb is not paying me for my services. Once again that waived fee was grabbed. Guests stay well clear away from Airbnb, families ask for payment before guest check in like any other hotel does! Airbnb are blood thieves! BEWARE!!!",4,"Beauty of Colchester, Other"
1393,"I rented a place in Napa Valley for my honeymoon and told the hosts exactly when I would be arriving and kept messaging them with updates. When I asked about a code to get in, they said I should just ring the doorbell. When we got to the rental, they were not there and had not sent over any instructions on how to get in. We called and called and waited and then eventually decided to leave and try to find a place to stay. Airbnb would not refund me for this, and when I disputed it with Bank of America, they refused the refund. I did not stay at the rental and did my part in showing up. I do not understand how I am not entitled to a refund. I will go with hotels from now on.",4,"Reema of Suwanee, GA"
1394,"My host decided to cancel my reservations 9 days prior to my stay in order to extend another customer's stay. What is Airbnb doing to protect its users like me who are booking through them? Nothing. They offered me $15.00 extra on top of a full refund to help re-book another Airbnb place or just refund all my money back into my credit card. They left ""host cancelled"" on the host's page, charge them a cancellation fee of $50.00 that benefits them and drop the super host. The worst part was that I wasn't able to leave a review of the host that cancelled on me.",4,"Ydnic of Tacoma, WA"
1395,"Airbnb is a joke!!! Not helpful at all. The ""customer service"" reps do not deserve to be paid for the poor service they provide. It's like a three-ring circus. The company advertises falsely.

I hope someone shuts this Mickey Mouse outfit down soon!",4,"Helen of Elk Grove Village, IL"
1396,"My wife and I immigrated to Canada from South Africa and made one month reservation with Airbnb, at 722 Queen Street, Kitchener. The reviews and pics were great so we took it at face-value in good faith. When we arrived late at night after a 34 hour journey we found that the accommodation was an absolute dump. Unfortunately, we had to spend one night in filth before we could get out and never go back. ",4,"Matthew of Kitchener, Other"
1397,"We booked a two bedroom two bath apt in New York City back in December 2017 for an October 2018 visit. Payment of half was made with no problem. Suddenly, last week, I get an email that our reservation has been canceled and our deposit returned. No explanation given, and when I emailed the host, he did not respond. I called Airbnb to say how upset I was and was told someone would expedite the issue and call me back. Long story short, three days later still no call from them, with an explanation, apology or anything. Can't find any good places now as most are sold out for the area we needed. We are beyond furious! We will NEVER use Airbnb again!",4,"Kip of Pleasanton, CA"
1398,"(2) We were locked out by the roommate. (3) Roommate answered the door with nothing on top and only a g-string on the bottom.

1399,"We've had a about twenty guests so far on Airbnb. The only issues that have come up is how Airbnb posts guest verification information and their lack of understanding of how it is viewed. We require a government ID from the guest to be provided to Airbnb and look for that information on the person's picture. When we drill down, several items are listed but infrequently, the government ID verification is not there. As a result, I have contacted the guest and Airbnb to find out what the story is. Almost without fail, Airbnb insists they are verified although I can find no proof thereof.",4,"Russ of Tucson, AZ"
1400,"Airbnb offers absolutely no protection for the customers in case the homeowner decides to cancel the booking. Even if you have reserved your place and paid all the money, there's no guarantee whatsoever that the owner will keep it for you, up till the very day of your stay. In my case, the homeowner of a NYC apartment deliberately canceled my booking 2 weeks before my $1400 worth stay, so I had to urgently seek a hotel in the vicinity - which turned out to cost me $700 more. On their end, Airbnb couldn't do much, and after a painstaking phone call with their customer representative, the best they could do was to offer me a paltry $15 discount on my ""NEXT"" stay. NEXT STAY?! Well, they are bold enough to think I will ever go back to their website again after that shameful incident.",4,"Olga of Costa Mesa, CA"
1401,"When I first signed up with AIRBNB I was excited. I had heard good things. As I used the service more, I started encountering discrimination due to traveling with a toddler in Phoenix area of AZ. One host kicked me out after one night without proper notice because my child was fussy. I was paying 100 dollars per night. When I asked him his name as I was checking in he answered me like he was someone in authority. Not friendly or down to earth. I have had two hosts accuse me of being extremely messy and in violation of house rules. ",4,"Christine of Carefree, AZ"
1402,"It is hard to understand how Airbnb stays in business with their non-existent customer service and total lack of concern for people simply trying to do business with them. I chose an available property, emailed the property owner and submitted my payment information. After giving all of my info, I got a vague popup notice from Airbnb saying there was some problem in accepting my credit card information advising me to use their HELP desk if I wanted immediate help. Of course I wanted immediate help, I am trying to book a property for a vacation and the clock is ticking. I tried submitting my credit card information again, getting the same error message. I tried using another credit card and got the same error message.",4,"Steven of San Antonio, TX"
1403,"In what other business, are you allowed to charge half the fee within SECONDS of a person hitting the ""request"" button... and it's non-refundable. I believe that is a direct violation of New York State's ""Buyers' Remorse"" laws and I intent to file complaints with everyone I can. Airbnb is nothing more than a free-for-all platform that doesn't protect the consumers who use it.",4,"Frances of New York, NY"
1404,"We have used Airbnb for a couple of trips and have had a great experience. Both hosts commented about how quiet we were and how clean we left everything. So we were shocked to receive a refund for the property with no explanation as to why the reservation had been canceled. In December or January, I booked a townhouse in La Jolla for June, as we will be attending a wedding in the area. Now, with the wedding soon approaching, we have to scramble to find accommodations. Airbnb should have the courtesy to tell us why our reservation is canceled. I will not be booking with them, again, any time soon. There are plenty of companies that stand by the reservations they provide.",4,"Marla of Walnut Creek, CA"
1405,"Jason ** & Ping ** are hosts of FIVE downtown Montreal, Canada condos listed on Airbnb. They are dishonest crooks! We stayed one night in one of their condos. After our check-out, they made false accusations to Airbnb that we had smoked pot and damaged their condo, and claimed $400 to cover costs they claimed they incurred to ‘sanitize’ the air of the condo. When we demanded to see the air sanitizing company’s invoice, it was clearly revealed they had ‘photoshopped’ a FAKE invoice to reflect their lie!",4,"M. R. of New York, NY"
1406,"Our family including 4 year olds was kicked out of our 2 week rental for being “too messy” in the middle of the night on our second week. We lost our home recently in wildfires and came here to give our friends we stay with some alone time away from us. We got refunded our remaining days. However, a week later the hostess in Santa Rosa, named Mara is requesting from us $360 in damages we did not do claiming her things were brand new and we did a bunch of damage, left a large mess, and stole things.",4,"Greg of Santa Rosa, CA"
1407,"Customer service extremely unhelpful. I made a reservation and chose the option to pay 50% now, 50% later. I paid for the initial 50% with my credit card. I received a gift card after I made the reservation and contacted customer service to see if I could apply the gift card toward the remaining balance. They put me on hold for 5-7 minutes and came back saying I could not, I had to pay the rest with credit card. I said that was ridiculous and unacceptable, let me speak with someone that could help me. They said no one could help me. ",4,"Noah of San Diego, CA"
1408,"My experience similar to others below. Booked a room, but when checked in, place was filthy, it looked like someone else was living there unregistered, and generally had a really creepy feel. Couldn't stay there, but when attempting to get refund from Airbnb, they will always defer to the host. Because I didn't have enough documentation, they wouldn't give me a total refund. I actually had pictures of the dirty bathroom clearly showing dirty linens, but they claimed they couldn't see anything. So you take a big risk - if your host is a good one, you're lucky. If they're not and misrepresent their place, you're on your own - the host can just lie to Airbnb and they'll defer to them - they are host-friendly, not renter friendly. Not for lone travelers concerned about safety - residence mentioned above (""Parsa"", in Northridge, CA) would have been unsafe, because host never showed up with a key, and there were unregistered guests.",4,"Chad of Clovis, CA"
1409,"Booked the entire first week at a cottage in Sarasota, Florida. Place was filthy but since it was Easter weekend AND spring break there was nowhere else to go. Host refuses to acknowledge her place was filthy and publicly called us nitpicky as well as flat-out lied to Airbnb about us. Airbnb has completely ignored our complaints to them even when we pointed out that the host received 2 more 5 star reviews from other people during the same time we were at the property! Since we had the whole property to ourselves, I am curious where these other guests were staying. It's a scam and I will never use Airbnb again and I will tell everyone who will listen about our experience. The name of the cottage is ""Bayou Get-Away Cabin"" in Sarasota, Florida.",4,"Kelly of Welland, ON"
1410,"This is for all the folks that has ever thought about using Airbnb.com. I just left a place that was too nasty to stay in. Because I didn't cancel before check in, I only got a sixth of what I paid refunded. Because I canceled I can't leave a review. Keep that in mind when you see awesome reviews. Perhaps current photos of the bathroom would be wise to ask for in advance. As a disclaimer, my first two experiences were great, the last two has been so awful. I will never use this again.",4,"jeni of Plain City , UT"
1411,"DON'T USE Airbnb! I requested to book a 3-bed apartment that by the description and pictures on Air BnB looked wonderful. The host asked me to confirm the ages of the people traveling with me before he confirmed the booking. I did just as he asked. He then confirmed the booking, charging my credit card. 5 minutes later he messages me and tells me I will have to share 2 beds and the place is under renovation, unsafe for teenagers. I told him immediately that would not work. Then he tried to backtrack and say it's not really under construction but the rooftop was unsecured and not safe for teenagers. He knew I was traveling with teenagers as he had asked me twice. I told him I booked the place for the view and the fact it had 3 beds. He told me too bad if I cancel. It's my choice and there is no cancelation so I still pay. I canceled immediately. ",4,"Melanie of Lehi, UT"
1412,"For the first time I wanted to book an apartment with Airbnb in San Diego downtown but ended with a bad experience. The apartment is given in my search results when I searched for the listings with 2 adults plus 2 children. Airbnb showed this apartment as 'Rare found' and also showed a beautiful view of the downtown as if it is from the apartment. When we actually checked in the apartment, it is not at all child-friendly apartment, no child lock, our 2 year old can easily open the main door and go out, also scary patio from where you can see the down floors from the rails which got the big spaces. There is no view at all from the apartment.",4,"Srinivas of Newark, CA"
1413,"Upon gaining access to the rental site we discovered a leaking kitchen ceiling, dangling light fixtures in kitchen and bathroom and no working lights in any living areas. Within a half hour we notified the host that the premises were unsafe and unacceptable and we were canceling. We had to go to a hotel for the 7day trip; this cost a great deal more. Within 12 hours we notified Airbnb of the situation and they assigned a customer support ""agent"" to work on the case. We indicated we were not going to cancel on the Airbnb website because, per their policy statement, doing so within 24 hours of our rental would result in forfeiture of all fees. He assured us ""we were doing the right thing"". A day later Airbnb said they would only refund half the rental/cleaning fees with the other half going to the host! It was obvious that Airbnb kept their service fees and tried to serve two masters, satisfying none!",4,"Nicholas of Woolwich, ME"
1414,"After the host of our reservation, I tried to work with a case manager to find a new host, but had a nightmare. Case managers as well as supervisors didn’t call me back for days, on multiple occasions. We ended up having to get a hotel and I was told by a case manager she could reimburse me up to $200 to help cover the difference in the cost of the hotel and my reservation. A supervisor then reneged on that and wouldn’t give me a dime. The supervisor also took several days off while we were trying to resolve this, without notifying me, which would be fine except Airbnb wouldn’t let another case manager or supervisor help. Be prepared to work around their schedules rather than them working around ours. Or just don’t do business with them, I never will again.",4,"Wade of South Bend, IN"
1415,"My friends and I booked an apartment with Airbnb about 2 months in advance. When we arrived, it was a scam. The apartment had been rented out to another group. Airbnb support did nothing to help us and did not take our situation seriously. They stranded 3 young females in a foreign city and have refused to refund the $173 we spend on the rental. DO NOT USE this company!",4,"Diana of Littleton, CO"
1416,"My wife, two year old daughter and I stayed in Miami last year using one of Airbnb's listings. Upon arriving, the unit had an over flooded bathroom and disgusting sheets. The property manager kept moving us from one unit to the other to accommodate his other guests, and when we complained he threatened us - taking advantage of our situation with a child - and told us any complaints will make us end up on the streets. Airbnb made us leave the location for our safety, and the matter was considered resolved when we were offered a coupon to use and in return we would not file an official complaint with authorities. We now want to use this coupon (which is under my wife's name), but my wife is unable to travel. Airbnb refused to have me use the coupon which expires in 1 month, thus rendering the situation unresolved. We wasted our vacation and money, and it seems like legal action should have been the right solution.",4,"Ashraf of Winchester, MA"
1417,"As a host I have brought many concerns to the staff of Airbnb over the years only to be contradicted or told that ""nothing can be done"" about my issues. The latest of them concerned a very satisfied couple who had stayed with us for 3 nights prior to leaving on a cruise. When they returned, they were very disappointed to learn that their 5 star review was not accepted because it exceed the Airbnb's timeframe for reviews of 14 days from the close of their stay. THEY WERE ON A CRUISE! They were having fun and they figured they'd wait till they were back in the comfort of their own home to compose a nice review. No such luck...another one of Airbnb's ridiculous policies (of which there are many more).",4,"Caesar of Wilton Manors, FL"
1418,"Two days before my travel date, Airbnb canceled my reservation because of a past offense in the background check. I’ve been renting from different hosts for a year, given and received positive reviews, never had complaints from hosts, and never had issues with them. Even though I got a refund, I still have to scramble to find a place to stay at the last minute. I did not attempt to contact Airbnb because I’ve read that they give no help or response to people whose accounts they deactivated or banned. Airbnb say they don’t discriminate, but they judge people by their past. An offense 10 years ago will get you banned. It’s only a matter of time.",4,"Terence of San Antonio, TX"
1419,"I have been cancelled by Airbnb twice as an active guest in less than 30 days. I booked one In San Francisco then another to Jenner beach For the remainder of my stay in Cali to visit my sick mother. Less than 1 week of my travel dates I get an email cancelling my Jenner Beach reservation that has been charged to my account/cc already. Instead of telling the truth that someone made a mistake of posting such the wrong price instead they tried to claim that the host was contacting me outside the website. Which is a lie, because the host never responded to me but manage to approve only the reservation with no words of hey or how. “Deep breath house” hosted by Jacqui. ",4,"LAILANI of Concord , GA"
1420,"Booked a vacation on my debit card, instead of my credit card which overdrew my account. I got the notification within 2 seconds of clicking confirm on Airbnb and called them immediately (waited on hold for 15 minutes before talking to someone). I asked if they could stop the transaction and if I could just give a new credit card number. They said no, they could not. I asked if they could cancel the booking and just rebook over the phone with a different credit card, they told me I had to cancel online and rebook but pay all the cancellation fees. What a ** joke! So I had to spend an hour out of my workday to drive up to my boyfriend's work, get his card, withdraw money from his account, go to my bank, make the deposit to cover the overdraft. Such a hassle!",4,"Ashley of Encinitas, CA"
1421,"They keep your money if you cancel a transaction. Instead of sending your money back to the credit card, they keep it as a COUPON. If you don't check and don't ask, the ""coupon"" aka your money expires after 1 year and you lose it!!! Also, if you see a room but are not sure and don't book it, when you get back, the price is much higher. The taxes they charge the host and the guest are not clear. I spoke to hosts who told me they were charged much more. WE NEED SOME AGENCY TO INVESTIGATE AIRBNB.",4,"Roberto of Bronx, Other"
1422,This past week I had a tenant stop their monthly payment to Airbnb and skip out in the middle of the night. This violates my cancellation policy. Airbnb told me they would take care of the money and that particular Airbnb staff member never documented anything. The second Airbnb staff member said after three attempts to collect they would send the case to collections. That was several days ago and of course Airbnb has no phone number that they can give me to talk to the collections department. I am receiving no support or assistance in spite of their claims that they do so. Homeowner beware. If the tenant skips out it does not appear that Airbnb provides any assistance with collecting the rent.,4,"Marie of La Mesa, CA"
1423,"I purchased a week April 6-9 and then a month June 6- July 6 of rooms for my wife and I's honeymoon (out of country). That was a little over two months ago. I woke up this morning to an email saying that every one of my rooms had been refunded. I leave tomorrow so I did the natural thing and panicked. I tried to log into my account but could not. I then received an email stating that not only was my account deleted but that I'm also screwed out of all my reservations. Turns out that, my probation that I had completed on deferred judification made it where, I did meet their requirements to stay with any of the lodgings.",4,"John of Liberty Hill, TX"
1424,I booked an apartment through Airbnb for an extended stay in Italy. The host could not meet for check-in because he stated he was going to be out of town. I had a friend that lived locally to pick up the keys for me. My stay was shortened due to credit card fraud. I left the key with the same person that picked them up since he was not available for checkout. The host called me at 2am demanding keys which I did not have. I was already out of the country but the host wanted me to call his relatives to make arrangements. A few hours after that call I received a bill for over $500.00 to have a lock replaced.,4,"Suzanna of Las Vegas, NV"
1425,"We stayed in ""Ueno Sharehouse for Backpackers"" last March 21, 2018. We checked out at 10 am the next day. At around 2:30 pm, host is accusing us of breaking the cup/glass in which we even did not use as we have our own bottled water. Host is asking us to pay additional JPY 800. We appealed to Airbnb and the only thing they said is: ""We feel this is fair as your host reported the damage before the next guest checked in"". Clearly, they just take the side of the host. They did not review the guests' appeal carefully. What if the host is just doing that for its random guests just to take extra money.",4,"Joanne of Santa Rosa, Other"
1426,"I have stayed at various Airbnb places over several years, and while most all of them have been ok or some very nice, others simply do not live up to what is advertised and end up being ""disasters"". And when there have been OBVIOUS issues with customer service and the places...i.e. filthy carpets, bathroom and zero amenities as you would expect from a bnb...oh wait, even the name is Airbnb, I am told that many places are just rooms in homes for rent with many other permanent renters already living there. Not really bnb's. Well, that is false advertising. ",4,"Fabian of Grants Pass, OR"
1427,I was headed to Columbia for a bachelor party. Booked the wrong place due to location and also a friend that visited the location and informed me the looks were nothing like the pictures. Also was in a unlicensed building. So I called claims and tried to cancel. Airbnb informed it was the host decision and of course the host declined due to very little bookings. The full payment was 9k. They took 50 percent. I cancelled 30 minutes after booking. Their claims manager took days to respond and took the side of the host. I live check to check and they wouldn’t even accommodate a common mistake. Their concern is for their hosts not their guests because that’s their money maker. They by far have the worst customer service information. I will be reporting them to the Better Business Bureau and recommend that no one use this company. Please spread the word.,4,"Nathanil of Cerritos, CA"
1428,"I booked an apartment on Airbnb 3 months ago. Apartment was shown available on Airbnb. Just after booking and paying I got information from host, that it was a mistake and apartment was overbooked. Airbnb didn't help to refund my money. Above all they refused to refund service fee, even though they wrongly offered an already booked room. Fortunately I had a honest host who refunded me completely. Comment of Airbnb: ""It's illegal!!"" NEVER AGAIN. I deleted my account. Can't recommend Airbnb.",4,"Thomas of Wallisellen, Other"
1429,"I feel that the main problem with Airbnb is that it allows a lot of bad hosts to get business that they would otherwise not get if not for the visibility that the Internet provide them. Many bad hosts are just very good at manipulating their image and reviews on the Internet so that they can take advantage of guests to make a quick profit. I am referring to the hosts which most guests would not decide to choose if they had been able to see the place in person, that is, in those cases where there are pretty obvious gaps between perception and reality. I also had hosts giving me false names, contact information, or pretending to be medical doctors or something else about them difficult to verify and I was surprised to find out that there is no Airbnb policy to discourage that. On the other hand though, Airbnb policies are tough on guests. Not fair. Airbnb policies are too biased in favor of hosts in my opinion.",4,"Steve of Toronto, ON"
1430,"When I booked my accommodation with Airbnb I saw the big print ""Free Cancellation"" (up to a week before arrival). Unfortunately, I didn't read the fine print that the cancellation does not apply to the service fee. Very disappointing that no watchdog is reviewing this type of deceptive practice. What would it take to have small print directly near the words Free Cancellation? Unfortunately, Airbnb has several ways to hide information that they don't want others to see.",4,"Klaus of Vancouver, BC"
1431,"Airbnb Hawaii. A ""charming cottage"" from hell at AirBnB. We sweated it (never used Airbnb before and won’t again) it as the owner would not release the address until the day before. As a group of three (one being my 18 year old son) we came to Oahu on business in Sept 2016 for 18 days. We felt getting a group lodging might be less expensive compared to getting 2-3 hotel rooms in Waikiki.",4,"Al of Murrieta, CA"
1432,"This is the original email I sent to Airbnb after I called them and they asked me to type up my complaint. ""I will send pics to follow after this email. I wanted to first describe the experience with Joseph in Siesta Key. This was a two day reservation totaling $3650. It was a completely overrated stay. This is a 1.8 million dollar house that should have been in pristine condition. There were many red flags upon arriving. But upon arrival we overlooked some looking forward to a weekend for my best friend of 20 yrs getaway before she gets married. So rather than a bridal shower we decided to find a place to stay where we could all gather and hang out without going anywhere. This house was definitely not what we expected. There were Cheerios on the floor by the front door. Fingerprints on all the siding glass doors. It was clear the countertops of the kitchen were not wiped down before our stay dispute the $250 cleaning fee that is required.",4,"Angelica of Lutz, FL"
1433,My business partner booked 2 different accommodations for a week long trip in London. Both locations were rated as 5 stars and both were unacceptable-less than 1 star. I could not stay at either for fear of bedbugs or worse. As a woman I feared for my safety in both locations. Both reservations were cancelled upon arrival and yet we charged full price for both locations. Airbnb's response to resolve the issue was equally unacceptable. We were forced to pay for the full 5 nights even though we cancelled and did not stay in either then we had to find last minute hotels at 350CDN a night. The stress was unbelievable. I will never recommend Airbnb to anyone. Hotels have spent years gaining their stars whereas any Joe can operate a bug infested rooming house. Call it a house with a private room for rent and have who knows who to write up phoney reviews for them. BUYER BEWARE. Airbnb is a scam.,4,"Barbara of Beaumont, AB"
1434,Airbnb will take your money when it should be refunded. I was not informed where the keys were located to enter my reservation so I cancelled with the host before I arrived due to not feeling safe to travel there without an understanding of how to securely lock the unit. I did not stay there for reason of safety and the lame customer service and host decided to keep my money and ignore the good faith effort to cancel before I arrived and my concerns for safety. Do not trust Airbnb... They will steal your money and they have hosts who ignore obvious reason to refund money.,4,"Brenda of Ross, CA"
1435,"I was a host on Airbnb with 7 apartments in the busiest location in the world for 2016- Osaka, Japan. Over the course of 3 years, I gradually scaled down the operation to just 1 and transferred to different website. Just now, I removed my last apartment from Airbnb and I cannot describe how relieved do I feel now, when I don't need to deal with these ** anymore. At first, they had great customer service and call centers. Then the sudden expanding of the company caught them unprepared for the size of their operation and the problems they haven't thought could appear. All in all, partnering with them cost me a lot of money, loss of business partners and respect from local community. They would randomly take side with clients, trying to cancel reservations with BS excuses, so they will not have to pay cancellation fee.",4,"Ivaylo of Varna, Other"

1437,"Airbnb refused to refund what I paid for renting a condo unit that was not suitable for rent or even for staying in it for one free night. We paid near 150 USD for three nights and I got refunded only 40 USD. I had both legal and ethical reasons to cancel upon checking in and viewing the place: The only aircon in the large condo was not working properly. The host representative who checked us in advised us to just restart the aircon every time it ""dies"" and it did stop within 10 minutes after we checked in. The host expected us to get up throughout the night to restart the aircon when it ""dies"". The host later denied what her rep told us and claimed that the aircon was working fine, although two people witnessed what the rep said. ",4,"Samuel of Sanford, NC"
1438,"The house was supposed to sleep 8 and only slept 6, it was supposed to be 15 min from French Quarter, it was 30 and sometimes more depending on traffic. The refrigerator did not work so all our food ruined and the owner never sent anyone out. The garbage disposal was also broken. We had to buy a air mattress and ice chest which was an extra expense and time from our vacation. Then a code enforcement officer shows up and says that this Home is being rented out illegally! I will never use Airbnb again!",4,"April of Fort Worth, TX"
1439,"I had a reservation at this room from 3/9- 3/12. We could only stay one night because the conditions were so deplorable. We were promised a rollaway bed and air mattress because there were 3 men staying. When we checked in neither was there upon check in, they finally dropped off air mattress with no blankets or pillows, then it didnt fit on the floor flat as room was too small, bathroom was full of mold, tiles caved in and falling off walls. These are not safe or healthy living conditions. They refused to refund me for the night we could not stay, they also refused to refund me for a future stay 6 months from now!! Do not use this company!",4,"Charles of Orlando, FL"
1440,"On the 11th of March, I booked an apartment in Poland. The response of the host was that the price was higher for the period (Christmas) that I booked. I filed a complaint at Airbnb stating that the EU Directive for Consumer Rights does not allow traders to change prices. It states: ""Traders are obliged to display correct and complete pricing information before a customer makes a purchase online"". Additionally, Article 7.12. of the terms and conditions of Airbnb for hosts states: ""You are solely responsible for setting a price (including any Taxes if applicable) for your Listing (“Listing Fee”). Once a guest requests a booking of your listing, you may not request that the guest pays a higher price than in the booking request.""",4,"Ralph of Nieuwegein, Other"
1441,"I don't know if Airbnb recently outsourced their call center or what but their service has gone way downhill. As a host that has two properties on Airbnb and VRBO I used to think Airbnb was much easier to do business with but that is not the case anymore. They changed my cancellation policy without notice, they've refunded my guests without consulting me, and after 5 years and hundreds of thousands of $ in bookings, they recently notified me that I am at risk of having my account suspended for ""only"" having a 4.7 Star rating while 81% of 170 reviews are 5 Star reviews. Besides the fact that math does not work, I'm not sure it's possible to get much better rating than 4.7 and I don't appreciate being their aggressive and condescending threats. They are so tone deaf and their customer service sucks. Better to use VRBO as host or traveler.",4,"John of Santa Cruz, CA"
1442,"Mark, my ""host"" in London, was exceptionally aggressive when we were a few minutes late checking out, and has now left patiently false feedback regarding our stay that I am afraid will prejudice future hosts.

We left without comment.",4,"Philip of Vienna, VA"
1443,When I first started using Airbnb I felt their services were excellent. In the last year I have noticed a complete change of customer service toward hosts. Last night trying to resolve a very simple problem of a guest requesting staying another night and trying to pay - it took 3 hours and at least 5 people to talk to. I was actually yelled at by one rep and told I should not charge them at all! Excuse me - why the heck not! I had some guests who were just filthy and had the house smelling like a garbage can.,4,"Donna of San Jose, CA"
1444,My family and I rented a condo through Airbnb which got broken into. The owner did nothing about it or the items that we had lost so we wrote a review on his page. He flagged it and it got removed. We followed the company’s review policy and did not violate it. I have lost confidence in Airbnb if they will not allow the negative posts along with the positive ones. How will future guests ever know that their safety or personal property can be compromised at this location? Very poor judgment by Airbnb!,4,"Audrey of Decatur, IL"

On the third day, we came back from an all-day fishing trip and several of our electronic and personal items had been stolen from the condo, approx $1800. Property owner strongly discouraged us from calling the police, advising that he would check it out. He did absolutely nothing. Airbnb would not accept our review due to their policy that no negative feedback is allowed. We will not recommend Airbnb because they do not allow honest reviews that reflect negatively on their property owners, even when it involves theft and personal safety.",4,"Carolyn of Bloomfield, NM"
1446,"I have always been a pleasant guest at any Airbnb I've stayed at, and have never had a single negative review.

1447,"The customer service is now past terrible. Airbnb is making adjustments on payments on their own, holding payments and doing it in a sinister manner where host and co-host are each unaware of each other's transaction which makes it easy for the payments disappear. Airbnb didn't honor a simple cancellation policy more than just once. Today I find out that I have a guest coming in few days, but I'm gonna end up owing Airbnb 250$+ after all transaction, because they claim I may owe them some money from March 2017??? If you are one of those owners that need to know when and how you are getting paid, this is gonna be nerve racking altogether.",4,"Mike of Lancaster, CA"
1448,Airbnb has denied to pay any money to me against the guest insurance claim. The house where I stayed burned to the ground which was caused by overheated wiring in the walls due to improper installation. I have been chasing Airbnb customer care for past 2 months and finally they have sent an email saying that they do not pay insurance for these type of incidents. If not for FIRE incident then I am curious for what type of incidents they pay the insurance and why they charge money for insurance. This incident could have been avoided if proper inspection was done by Airbnb. The American guests who stayed at the same house got the insurance money from Airbnb 3 weeks ago without any pain. This is a complete torture and racial discrimination by Airbnb. Please advise what I can do in this country as an immigrant to claim for my loss. I can share more proofs on request.,4,"Priya of Seattle, WA"

1452,DO NOT BOOK WITH AIRBNB. We booked a reservation with a host SEVEN months in advance. We went to confirm our stay with the host a week before leaving and they said they were not going to honor our reservation. Apparently they were not allowed to offer Airbnb in the residence anymore. They failed to tell us that. So we call Airbnb and request a refund and compensation to pay for a hotel (as we are 4 days from the trip - spring break in Cancun) they offer TEN PERCENT of the original stay. Trying to find a place to stay in this location and time is IMPOSSIBLE AND EXPENSIVE. I guess their customer service thinks that an extra $40 is enough to pay for a last minute reservation. THEN the refund was supposed to take 5-10 days when we leave in 4... Only after talking to 4 customer service reps and a manager was I able to get an extra $100 (which I'm not even sure I will be getting). ,4,"Cassie of Duluth, MN"

They now want a credit card number before they will delete my account! This is just creepy and not safe! DO NOT Trust Airbnb!",4,"MJ of Cloudland, GA"
1456,I FEEL ROBBED - Airbnb claims that a host should be worry free of damage done by a guest. WRONG! They will NOT Pay me for extreme damage that my guest has also admitted to me through messages that I showed them. They are telling me to resort through other options and wished me future luck with future guests. Their responses came on graveyard hours which is a scam because they only give a week to get estimates. I gave them an estimate from a reputable contractor that is licensed and sent them the messages from the guest and it still wasn’t enough for them. Scam company. Do not use them unless you are prepared to pay for any and all damages. This is the third time I’ve had damage and not one was paid. Enough is enough. I will no longer be hosting for a company that doesn’t take responsibility. Avoid from hosting!,4,"Rio of Carmichael, CA"
1457,"I worry about Airbnb insufficiently screening hosts. And I would not book an Airbnb by myself. But we've stayed in some very convenient locations, like Brooklyn near Prospect Park.",4,"Victoria of Austin, TX"
1458,When Airbnb changed their calendar format it cancelled all my blocked dates. I did not know about this until a guest made a booking on a blocked date. Of course I had to regret and apologize to the guest. Airbnb only arrogantly warned me that they would remove my listing if it happened again. I explained what had happened but no apology... US companies never apologize... must be their lawyers. Also I get guests that ask for contact information and I have to tell them that Airbnb does not allow it. Airbnb puts all the onus on the hosts. Their model is good but fading fast. I would love to have other business to work with.,4,"Al of Shemlan, Other"
1459,"Last year during the summer I rented an RV in Winter Haven in order to take the family to Legoland. We arrived at the RV and from outside it seemed nice next to a pond. We stepped inside the RV and the family got hit in the face with a poop stench. We couldn’t get ahold of the owner until a few hours later. Wife and kids couldn’t breathe because of the horrific ODOR emitting from the toilet which engulfed the entire RV. Finally, we jumped back into our car and drove to a nearby hotel.",4,"Miguel of Pompano Beach, FL"
1460,"The biggest crooks and the worst business ever. They removing reviews of bad guests with no reasons because they know bad reviews gonna demolish people accounts and they not gonna use Airbnb and go to hotels, because hosts wouldn't host them. It happened at least 3 times with me when Airbnb always could find something in my negative review to guest that violates their policy. The last case was literally catching off guard when the guy who stayed in our hostel made a drama on his last night staying when police almost came over because the girl he hang out with accused him in putting illegal substances in the drink and this screwed up idiot lost his wallet under the bed accusing people in stealing it. We saved that idiot from police almost coming for him because we talked to the girl and calmed her down. ",4,"Sergii of Miami Beach, FL"
1461,I would give it a zero if I could. The room at the Fontainebleau that was reserved 6 mos in advance and paid in full with receipt and reservation number was not cancelled by the owner the day of arrival.

1462,"Found a great home on Whidbey Island ""Anchors away"" right on the beach. Will be there for a wedding later this summer. After inputting all my info, they then decide my ID is not a match with my picture. Hello. That's me. What can you do? They thought it was OK enough to take my $1000 payment for the rental! Then cancelled my reservation at 2 am the next morning, stating they couldn’t ID me! Never called, never gave me a chance to submit another picture.",4,"Colette of Stevensville, MT"
1463,"Rented home in Cape Coral, Florida thru Airbnb. The host was Michelle of MHB Property Management. The house **. When we arrived we couldn't get in. The host had to be called, the host didn't return the call. Another person we had not dealt with did, after we go in there were no directions to operate the pool or hot tub. Again we called the host but no one returned our call, the stove was leaking gas so bad the women were scared to use it (very dangerous situation). The maid service left a note apologizing for not completing the cleaning of the house which we paid $325.00 for the cleaning service. Contacted Airbnb and the host company and they blew us off because THEY WERE ALREADY PAID! Sad state of affairs!",4,"Terry of Gaylord, MI"
1464,We rented a house from Airbnb for 3 days. The description never said it was a trailer/modular home. First arrived and there was a garage right by the back patio. Man came out wearing a pair of jeans and no shirt. He was not the host. He worked most of the day. Customer service said that since I didn’t have a picture of the man it was out of their hands. Dining room light was missing 3 light bulbs and kitchen ceiling fluorescent light did not work. Call host and they brought us over light bulbs but kitchen light was never fixed. Pulled a baking pan out and it was full of rust. Stove burners did not work. There was food under the couch cushions. Description said House was walking distance to wineries. Not true. Contacted customer service when I got home to requests refund and sent them some of the pictures I took. ,4,"Monica of Lapalma, CA"
1465,"I booked a place for my husband to stay for a month. What transpired was horrible. The place was cluttered. The bed had missing planks and you fell through sometimes. Fridge was filthy. The worst part was the bathtub screen was broken, so to get in and out of the bathtub/shower you had to sit on a ledge and squish your feet around. My husband hurt his back getting out and he finally checked out. The air conditioner doesn't work in the room he booked and in Australian heat this is unacceptable.",4,"Anne of Docklands, Other"
1466,Last week I booked a place for my family to stay for a week through Airbnb. After a couple of hours I received my reservation confirmation. Within a few minutes I received a text from the owners stating that the amount was not right and that it would be several hundred more dollars per night if I wanted to stay there. I thought it was some kind of a scam! I had to leave my home for the evening within a few minutes of getting this text. I thought I would wait and see if anything more would come of it. When I got home I immediately went to bed. After I was asleep someone from Airbnb called me and woke me up. I heard them say something about an emergency. I said I was sleeping and they had woken me up. And I knew it was not an emergency!,4,"Garnet of Backus, MN"
1467,I was part of an adult and professional family who rented an expensive house through AIRBNB for four weeks so I speak from bitter and first hand experience. On both sides of the house we rented through AIRBNB there were major construction works being carried out. Let me be clear - these were not renovations or extensions or repairs - but brand new builds. THEY DID NOT COME ABOUT AFTER OUR BOOKING BUT WERE KNOWN TO THE HOST AT THE TIME OF BOOKING. They were major building sites - in what was described as a quiet residential area. At NO time whatsoever did the host point this issue out to us. The overriding comment I am making is this. Problems within a rented AIRBNB can crop up after the 24 hour period. They do not always happen within the first 24 hours.,4,"Joan of Hebden Bridge, Other"
1468,"I recently went on our first trip to Europe, just my 10 year old and myself. One stop was in Denmark for 3 days in December. The apartment we rented from Jaroslav and Lina ** had no heat and wasn't as described. Upon entering, there was an unusual smell, but we just figured that different countries cook different foods and not every place smells like home.",4,"Cristie of Leetsdale, PA"
1469,We have had 2 cancellations with Airbnb. Last one they had $2000 of our money for almost 5 months and cancelled with no interest or bonus at all. Of course no other places or I would have picked them initially. We booked VRBO for years and never had an issue.,4,"Darlene of Regina, SK"
1470,"My daughter and I both tried to take pictures of our government issued IDs and our faces, in order that we might make a reservation. We are not stupid. We have both graduated from high school which should be all one would need in order to fill out a reservation. In addition, we have between us two Bachelor of Art degrees, two Master degrees, and one Ph. D. But could we make a reservation? Why no, we couldn't. It seems neither of us was capable of taking pictures that were up to Airbnb's standards.",4,"Judy of Brooklyn, NY"
1471,"Very troublesome and deceitful - I booked an accommodation with AirBnB. They sent a confirmation number confirming complete and paid reservation. The next morning they canceled my reservation, saying I needed a new photo and government ID. They should not have confirmed and charged me if they didn't have all the information they required. This happened once before as well.",4,"Pamela of Rockport, MA"
1472,"I was a host on Airbnb and the guest completely ruined my home. I wrote a negative review of the guest but Airbnb removed it. Airbnb does not what negative reviews to impact your profit margin. That means you don't see negative reviews of guests, Which means you are unprotected. That means that guest will destroy someone else's home. Airbnb is unethical and hypocritical. They talk about community but it's a lie.",4,"Ann of Dundas, ON"

1475,"My family and I wanted to visit Montreal for 3 days and decided to book a place through Airbnb, instead of paying for hotel. The booking process was easy and simple as usual, so no problem there. The day we were supposed to arrive, our host told us that there is a leak in his condo and is unable to host us. He was extremely nice and offered us a free stay at another condo, however we wanted something different so we declined the offer. We went on Airbnb AGAIN, because we thought we just had a bad luck and it was nobody's fault.",4,"Natalia of Ottawa, ON"
1476,I am a homeowner listing on Airbnb. Their customer service is horrible. My listing is corrupted so that I can't respond to requests for bookings. I have spent hours on hold with a series of reps who haven't helped. One rep refused to believe my story and I had to send her screenshots of the problems on the site. After spending 20 minutes on hold each time I got cut off twice. Supervisor was supposed to call me back. He never did. They redact emails and phone numbers so you and potential guest can't contact each other directly. So far I have lost 2 bookings. And don't know what to do next.,4,"Lorna of Brookline, MA"
1477,"Rented what was billed as a ""very nice condo on a golf course"". When I arrived it was actually a filthy trailer soaked in cigarette residue uninhabitable. The pictures used in the ad were not even the same property. The host persuades you to pay her directly on PayPal, then when you arrive offers a refund when you can't tolerate staying there. She never provides the refund & Airbnb won't help you because you've paid the host directly (at her urging of course). This is the listing, in Cathedral City CA: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4949043. Beware of this listing. Airbnb continues to provide listing for this fraud. In person she appears with her elderly mother & the 2 of them are extremely charming. The charm ends when you attempt the promised refund and the host begins hurling insults via text & email.",4,"George of Rio Nido, CA"

Property filthy in places especially kitchen- oven and fridge, bed at point of collapse, prescription drugs for owner in drawer in the kitchen accessible to anyone (we had children with us). Owner refusing 1 night's refund as we left without giving them notice or chance to rectify?! Would have taken them longer than the 2 nights we had booked to rectify! Airbnb NO help!

1479,"I had what I thought was a confirmed reservation for Ken's condo in Bangkok. And, about one month out, I received an email that Ken had ""canceled"". I could not believe it. Host are able to cancel. And, while Airbnb claims the host is penalized... The renter receives NONE of that penalty (it goes to Airbnb). So, you are simply left out in the cold to find another condo. Well, I suppose I could just ""search"" for a different condo. But, what happens when that host cancels? And, Airbnb claims to put notification on the host's page that he/she has canceled. One week later there is still no notification for other potential renters on Ken's page. Simply, BEWARE.",4,"Ben of Goddard, KS"
1480,"Guys be careful when you book on Airbnb next time. I made a booking No. **. I purchased air tickets and packed my bags for next days travel - only to hear that the host has cancelled my booking. And Airbnb does not take any responsibility to provide me alternative booking. Since it is the last minute - now they are demanding me to shell out 300% MORE so that I can get similar property. It is such a huge disappointment that I never expected from Airbnb. They charge you 20% booking fee, but when things don't go right, they just wash off their hands blaming the host. Come on, do we book with Airbnb because we know the host prior to booking?",4,"Ramesh of Taguig, Other"
1481,"SHAME ON AIRBNB. SHAME ON AIRBNB. I tried very hard to get help less than 24 hours after I had booked a room and wanted to change due to lack of trust of the host. Airbnb made no effort to make things right for me. You have NO advocate with Airbnb if things go bad... I had until now booked with them with a false sense of security that their customer service would handle things fairly if needed, however my experience with Maria at Airbnb was proof that they put ill educated and poorly trained people in charge of handling (if you call it that!) issues.",4,"Ma of Calabasas, CA"

I followed Airbnb guidelines and contacted a representative at their Help number, which took all of my information and the specifics revolving around the incident and damages. The rep said she would email me a form that I needed to fill out to report such damages to my property. 24 hours later I called the Help number again because I had not received the form as promised and a new rep said there were no notes in their system of my incident report.

So we rated our trips with one and two stars with a note about its infestation of unwanted bed bugs. First response from Airbnb next day was: ""Reconsider your evaluation"". We did not do it- nothing to reconsider. Second day response from Airbnb: ""You are not in compliance with the rules therefore we cannot post your comments"". When we tried to response and include a photo of our bites we found out that we were blocked out from the system. Basically they want to hide any bad experience due to their future profits that are above all for them. So we cannot warn the future guests for this situation.",4,"Jerry of Chico, CA"
1484,"My wife does not understand English very well and when I stepped in to question an unethical by an Airbnb ""professional"" he immediately said I was not on the account and he terminated the phone call.

Just a terrible representation of a business.",4,"Forrest of Bloomington, MN"
1485,Airbnb is getting extremely unreliable. A few months ago my husband booked a place in Paris. It was canceled. He rebooked a place again and that one was cancelled less than 2 weeks before he was leaving. A few months ago I thought I would give it a try again and booked a house in Barcelona for a very reasonable price. Dec 19th I get a notice that the booking was canceled. Another friend of mine told me something similar happened to her in Madrid.,4,"Rose of Nyc, NY"

After one night, we were forced to leave because the smell of natural gas and mildew permeated the apartment leaving us all feeling nauseous. We first addressed our concerns with the owner, who seemed to think we should just keep the main doors open (keep in mind, the doors faced a street with heavy traffic). We then addressed our concerns with Airbnb customer service and finally submitted a detailed review to notify other Airbnb users of our disturbing experience in hopes that the owner would rectify the situation for all future guests. This was one week ago. ",4,"Jayme of St Louis, MO"
1487,I made the following complaint to Airbnb about a fraudulent listing of a two bedroom apartment and they denied my complaint... there is no standard as to what someone can list a room as a bedroom: BEWARE!!! I have one simple question: What standard does AIRBNB use when allowing owners of properties to define a room as a BEDROOM? Is it the IBC (International Building Code) The ICC (International Construction Code) The IRC (International Residential Code)? OR Do you just take the owners word for it without any defined standard?,4,"Robert of Camarillo, CA"
1488,I want to love Airbnb. In 4 stays over 4 mos - average $100/night I found some very aggravating things hosts could easily fix. My suggestions: Check your cleaning service! 2 coffee pots were filthy - one impacted with moldy grounds - Clean often with white vinegar! 2 places had coffee pots - no filters. I'll bring coffee but the correct size filters provided by host would be nice. 1 had awesome espresso machine - that didnt work. Dust! Sneezed all night at a $100 guest house - in the AM I found the wall at the head of the bed was covered in dust! Under the bed same (Same place with moldy coffee pot).,4,"Susan of Gardnerville, NV"

I had to request a refund which can take up to 5 days to go back to my card. Luckily we have plenty of funds. However, what about people who can't afford to book another place without that money? This is a scam. Should not trust your card with these people. Hopefully the refund will show up and we don't have to go through a dispute process. I will not book with Airbnb again.",4,"Dusty of Joplin, MO"
1491,I booked an Airbnb home from host S.F. Maple in Jupiter Fl. After full payment they canceled our reservation a week prior to our stay with no explanation.

1492,Every time I try to make a booking they show a higher price than what they advertise. What is happening here. This is not something that changes based on for example day of week or month but this is very consistent. Stop lying. I won't use you if that continues.,4,"Ben of Austin, TX"

Well the picture of the cabin we chose was really cute and it looked so nice that I booked it for 3 days. When we got to the cabin it was NOT what it seemed on the Airbnb site and not what it was described as being. The cabin was only about 100 feet off a country road with 2 other cabins right in front of it. The people in the both of the front cabins looked like they owned their cabins and the front cabin had parking right up to the front of our cabin. There was no ""mountain views"" and the people in the front cabin made noise up to 10 pm. ",4,"KC of Cocoa, FL"
1495,I was having a major issue verifying my payment option which lead to a delay in my reservation. I had no other options and hadn't heard back from the host. I spoke with James ** who remained on the line while navigated the system and waited for a response from the host. He then offered to contact host in a attempt to make sure I booked the location time and price I wanted. James ** went over and beyond and was literally a guardian angel and prevented me from being on the streets that night.

According to the rules on the website there was NO charge for extra people, $100 cleaning fee, and check out time was Monday at 11:00 am.

1498,I went to NYC this summer through a private room that I booked in Manhattan for a really good deal. I had been traveling from Penn station to the apartment since it was relatively close by foot so I walked. I had been contacting the host all day but I had no answer. And I even messaged her the days before and nothing. I arrive to the location and still I have not received any information from the host as to what apartment number. This was my first experience with Airbnb in NYC and I am 18 years old in this city. I contacted Airbnb after two hours of no contact with the hostess. She had read my texts but no answers.

1500,"I contacted the host to ensure I did not have a reservation within 24 hours of my inquiry. The reason why is the site said his place was inactive.

I responded and reminded him of our previous conversation only to be told no, I was wrong. I have a long string of emails to prove I am right.

1503,"Hotels are expensive so the idea to rent a room with a local is a great option... However, I have tried it 3 times and each time, it was a pretty poor experience. Yes, the rent was low but so was the quality. My first experience in an ""urban"" location turned out to be a room in an very inconvenient location where I was kept awake most of the night by barking dogs and then awoken in the early morning by roosters! The bathroom was pretty dirty. Fortunately, I was only staying there one night so I held my tongue and coped. On the next two trips which were longer, I found dirty rooms full of mosquitoes, no hot water to shower and no air conditioning even though it was listed as an amenity.

Hours later I was contacted by the owner/host of the property telling me that it was not available on the dates I had booked and therefore my reservation was null and void.

I have over 40+, glowing reviews on my account, and have paid this business a LOT of money. I have been treated VERY unfairly recently, and the scenario follows:",4,"E of East Stroudsburg, PA"
1514,Dont believe in prices in site!!! You dont know the last price until the end of reservation. I booked a house for three nights and the price was 250 dollars per night but airbnb decided that I should pay 83 Dollars more!,4,"Arash of Istanbul, Other"
1515,"I was left completely stranded by Airbnb when my vacation rental fell through. I showed up to the unit with my 3 out-of-town family members and the vacation rental had not been cleaned since the previous occupants. The unit was also terribly maintained and did not look anything like the pictures displayed. While we were trying to contact the unit owner and discuss these issues with Airbnb, 3 of my friends showed up with $200 worth of groceries as they planned to BBQ with the family that day.",4,"Colleen of San Diego, CA"
1516,"As a property owner listing my property on Airbnb for rentals, it’s a miserable, unfair, experience. They get payments wrong, pause your listing for various unfair or mistaken reasons, and are difficult to deal with. I recommend you stay away and use other major rental sites that I’m sure you’ve heard of. Those are fine, imo.",5,"Brian of Plano, TX"
1517,"Airbnb is a total scam. They canceled my acct on vacation and left me living in the streets for complaining. The property I booked had no working plumbing, no working showers and no working toilets. Total scam. Using it you risk being robbed.

1518,airbnb decided to not go ahead with charges this time,5,"Serge of Monteregie, QC"
1519,I booked at house in February and needed to cancel in March for a stay in August. The refund policy is very misleading. Cancel within 48 hours of booking and 14 days before check in to get full refund. Cancel up to 7 days before check in and get a 50 percent refund minus service charge. Cancel within 7 days of your trip and the reservation is non refundable. The host tells you they think you get back the amount. Airbnb tell you different. Service charges taken. Out of $393.28 I’m getting back $8.22 cents. ,5,"Sally of Calgary, AB"
1520,"I canceled a reservation 60 days prior to a house with Strict cancellation policy. Guess what, I still have to refund from the host for money. The host told me that my cancellation excuse is ""lame"", and she has the right to decide not to refund my money. How ridiculous? What is the point with a definition of Strict cancellation policy? On AirBnb web page, it sad that ""cancellation before 14 days will get full refund except service fee"". AirBnb is getting worse and worse each year. I won't use it again.",5,"Zoe of Davis, CA"
1521,"My first and only experience was horrible. I booked a house and made a down payment in January for a trip in March. There was an issue with payment because of my account being hacked into. They canceled my reservation without informing me that they were doing so. When I realized this days before our trip, I called and received the worst customer service in my life, specifically from Raven. They claimed that they emailed me to let me know but I never received it. They said I did not verify my email and that’s why. How were they able to take almost $400 from me if I hadn’t verified my email? ",5,"Tabatha of Saint Petersburg, FL"
1522,Whatever you do don't book Airbnb. They cancelled my trip the day before and said I was locked out for security issues out of the blue the day before. I wish I read the reviews first. I now not only have to find a place for myself but my whole crew.,5,"Joseph of Myrtle Beach, SC"
1523,"My first experience with Airbnb was one of a bait and switch tactic. Instead of a hotel, I decided to stay in an apartment. The rate was $201 per night. During the booking process, the rate increased to $250 per night. Luckily, I double checked everything before submitting payment. I ended up booking the reservation through another well known website for the original price of $201 per night, plus I saved a little due to the booking fees being lower. Since, I've received multiple emails from Airbnb encouraging me to complete the booking even though it's no longer available. I'm very disappointed and don't understand why companies participate in such unethical practices.",5,"Dawn of Birmingham, AL"
1524,"After months of struggling with Airbnb...I gave up and then easily booked my vacation at VRBO! No more shock and disappointment discovering the difference between Airbnb’s hosts’ posted and actual price of rentals! No more delayed, confusing communications from hosts’ reneging on pricing and rental availability! And perhaps best of all no more suffering through Airbnb’s so called customer reps insisting that hosts are too busy to post accurate information and renters just need to waste as much time as it takes trying to get accurate rental info or who arbitrarily cancel an Airbnb customer’s account because the customer objects to such a woefully lacking customer service model.

So I hurry up and canceled the reservation, but they said the cancellation policy is very strict, you may cancel the reservation within 48 hours and 14 days before check in to get a full refund. It is very tricky, I canceled my reservation 100 days before I check in but they still charged me 50 percent of my deposit which is $468.75.

1527,"Airbnb.com says that you can cancel a booking and get full refund, or free of charge, if you cancel your booking before 48 hours, or within 48 hours of booking. Well, I am trying to cancel a 28 day booking I made in Budapest, but I am starting to get a really bad feeling about this host. I am afraid this host might be a scam, and I didn't want to risk getting to a faraway land in a country I’ve never been before, and risk not being able to get in the apartment with a child. I changed my mind and I was thinking to stay in another city instead, but since I paid $792.00 I wanted to get a refund so I could use it for another booking in another city. But airbnb.com website is telling me that my full refund (in less than 48 hours of booking) will be only $64.00. This company airbnb.com is a scam. Please be aware.",5,"Alexandra of Issaquah, WA"

1531,Recently rented a place and the owner kept my deposit saying that we scratched his fridge door yet we are positive it was his cleaner. He charged us $300 for a scratch and AirBNB allowed him to do this even though he never repaired the scratch. He got a fake quote and they allowed it. I have only gotten great reviews and am always very careful. AirBNB refused to keep open communication with me and immediately charged my credit card.,5,"Rhonda of Honolulu, HI"

1533,"I had booked a condo in the middle of June for a December vacation. My wife and I were already in Huatulco when the host cancelled on us two days prior to moving into the condo. Airbnb gave me a $92.00 credit to put towards another property. With only two days before we required a place to stay I booked another property which ended up being 6 times the original booking. I have read and re-read their policies on Host cancellations and have been going back and forth with Airbnb to get this resolved. I am going on three months now and they keep putting it to a different customer care department. I have copied all my correspondences with them and have shown them their own policies in regards to a Host cancellation.

He gave me no resolution so I contacted Airbnb to request my refund and I did it within their 24 hour time frame as stated on the refund policy.

I don't understand how they cancel my reservations hours before arrival then trick me into another reservation under false pretenses. Double cross me twice then expect me to trust them not to cancel on me again? Why? If I am too ** for your LA reservation I should be too ** for your Las Vegas reservation.

I have confirmed with letter from the bank that account is closed, and that there is no chargeback request for the charge, at which point I was directed to provide a new card for refund process.

So not only is the $400 dollar gift card stuck (we can't sell it or get rid of it) we have to use on another trip using AIRBNB which will be the very last time we use them.

Knowing it was going to be a long stay, I called Airbnb prior, to let them know I was concerned about the utilities being included in the price. Utilities are paid per use and it is hard to anticipate what the guest will be using, mainly in summer with AC units. Airbnb told me not to worry because I would be covered by their standard agreement. After the guest had left, I received the electrical bill and it was 3 times more than what I had anticipated. I brought it up to Airbnb and the only thing they had to say was they are sorry but the security deposit can not be applied to utilities. Utilities are always included in the price. How are we supposed to estimate the electrical use for extended stays? It does not feel fair to estimate a really high number and make some people overpay.",5,"Yolanda of New York, NY"

1560,The matter first began when Airbnb froze payment on my account. I opened a simple ticket to inquire why. First Airbnb said I had to fill out a US tax account form. This was false as I am in Canada. I spent time and money trying to resolve the matter based on this false advice. Next Airbnb said I needed to become a business and provide my business details. Again I investigated. This was also false. Lastly it was a simple matter unrelated to what Airbnb support told me.

And asked for letter from doctor. Hello! You can just Google the name of the doctor and bam your privacy is out of the window! I received a confirmation that my refund of $336 is on its way! I just need to know when, and none of the customer support aka Case Manager can answer it.",5,"Dale of San Francisco, CA"
1571,"I just tried to book a place and after paying, was prompted to verify my identity with the last 4 digits of my Social Security number along with full name and date of birth, I input the information and it told me it was incorrect (twice). I called the help number since I legally changed my name last month and maybe they haven't updated their system. They had me send a photo of my SS card and I blocked out the first 5 numbers with the last four digits clearing visible along with my full name. This should have been sufficient to confirm my ID but then the Airbnb rep I was speaking with asked me to resend a picture of my SS card with all the numbers visible! Very sketchy Airbnb! I said I would not share the full number and their only solution for me was to have someone else book the reservation on my behalf. Will not use Airbnb next time if they are going to require me to share all my confidential info with an overseas third party screening company.",5,"Molly of Coronado, CA"
1572,"I rented lodging through Airbnb in Belize. The manager started running scams on me, and I vacated the (not very nice) facilities and settled up with the owner, including paying an early cancellation fee and getting a document from the owner that all disputes had been settled. Three days later a new charge showed up on my credit card showing a $150 charge from them. They blame the owner. The owner says I have to work through them, and I'm still working on getting that charge reversed, 3 months later. These guys are rip off artists. Never, ever again.",5,"David of Plano, TX"
1573,The house we rented through Airbnb was nasty with some blood and with spots on duvets and bed sheets. Towels were never cleaned and condoms under the couch. I forward all the photos to them and asked for a refund and their response was what I provided wasn’t enough. Never again.,5,"Amin of Northridge, CA"
1574,"Airbnb is a nightmare of a company. After walking into a loft that was vacated by Airbnb guests I was confronted with a bed that a guest had vomited and defecated on. In an attempt to conceal the damages, the guest wrapped the soiled sheets in clean towels, turned the pillow cases inside out, and ""made the bed"" with the soiled duvet. Upon check out, the house rules convey guests need to report any damages (not once has a guest stepped up for obvious damage) among other things that need to be tended to, like locking up. Guest did not lock the door and so I had to send someone over to lock up. Had the guest revealed what had happened, steps of sanitation would have been implemented.",5,"James of San Diego, CA"
1575,"My wife and I rented an Airbnb in Stavanger, Norway. The place literally made us both ill. There were rats, mold in the walls, mold in the wooden floor, furniture destroyed, appliances broken, no vacuum cleaner, bathroom illegally installed so rats had direct access to the unit, no lock on the entrance door. When we made Airbnb aware of the place we told them that we had both developed respiratory problems and headaches their reply was that this is not sufficient for a refund!!!",5,Michael of Norway
1576,"I had a situation where I rented a house under specific ""house Rules"" and ""Security Deposit Amt."" The agreement was made ~2 months prior to rental. ~2.5 weeks prior to our rental date the owner changed the ""house rules,"" notifying us that there would be surveillance cameras inside the house and the security deposit was changed from $2000 to $3000. I had full documentation of the original terms of the rental agreement as well as the changes made. AirBNB customer service reps (located outside of the U.S.) neither understood Airbnb's own policies nor did they care about the violation of the renter. I tried speaking with reps from within the U.S. The company is extremely chaotic. Could never speak with same reps twice. It was a nightmare. I lost $1260.00. I WILL NEVER USE AIRBNB'S SERVICE AGAIN SO LONG AS I RESIDE ON THIS EARTH SO HELP ME GOD! They are a sham!",5,"Patrick of Sayville, NY"
1577,"I’ve been hosting using Airbnb the last couple months and find the app and company policies to be quite unfair for us hosts. For example, anytime someone has an inquiry/question you as a host must pre-approve them staying with you in order to avoid penalties. I have had several guests ask to park at my place for up to 3 weeks while they travel & only book 1 night at my place. ",5,"M of City,City"
1578,"Fist of all Airbnb did not follow their company refund policy to issue my refund. Second of all, the case manager erased all the communication record between me and her in my personal profile of Airbnb!!!! Third of all, Airbnb case manager refuse to post my review to the host SPI Rental South Padre Island which steals $1556.17 from me without providing a safe environment and created lots of issues which qualified for the refund to customers based on Airbnb refund policy. I spent two horrible night there and was charged for $1556.17. Airbnb helps those treating and disgusting host to fool customers to rent from Airbnb. Airbnb prevented a customer to review the terrible host and just put the good review for the terrible to help them fool people and make their commission fee!!!",5,"Emily of Pearland, TX"
1579,"We rented a condo a month ahead of time. When we arrived, the lockbox code did not work. We called the host... Long voicemail saying he was out of town... Voice mailbox was full. Left text for host... no response after an hour. Called Airbnb... was on hold for 50 minutes. Agent said he would try to call host. Agent called back in 15 minutes saying that the host had finally answered but had then hung up on the agent! The agent canceled our reservation on the spot and said the host has the right to cancel at any time!! This is not the first time an Airbnb host has canceled at the last minute. I find that VRBO and HomeAway are much more professional and reliable and will continue to use them in the future.",5,"Jill of Greenville, SC"
1580,"I am saddened to share my terrible experience with the Airbnb hosts. I have never ever in my entire life of traveling experience such terrible people.

My greatest unpleasant surprise was to find out that the first host has no house available for me and my family,",5,"akhona of Other, OTHER"
1581,So Airbnb likes to ** with people too much. I normally don’t care to write reviews but I’ve had too much trouble with Airbnb and I just want everyone to know that they are the worst company. Let me tell you how. Bear with me because this is a long issue I’m about to complain about. In 2017 around June or July a friend and I took a trip to California. On the way to California about 2 hours out our Airbnb was cancelled. We felt with Airbnb for a long time and had a huge issue with customer service so we were told we would receive a credit for our next stay. Now this is a whole issue I’m not about to get into because it has nothing to do with this current issue but I want you to know before I took my trip on 11/14/2018 I called Airbnb since I never received credit from my trip in 2017. I called and they gave me 100$ credit FOR MY TROUBLES in 2017. Keep that in mind.,5,"Naturally of Scottsdale, AZ"
1582,"We recently rented an apartment in Barcelona Spain, and the experience wasn't good at all, neither the support from Airbnb. The apartment was dirty, no sheets, no towels and the AC did not work. It is really frustrated and unfortunate for most customers as I went through the reviews here. Airbnb seems to care only about the money from the host and they take the side of the host, no matter what they say, I realize that they can say anything, and that is really troubling, not fair and not right at all, and gives you with a bad taste and awful experience that makes you question choosing Airbnb again.",5,"Belinda of Oviedo, FL"
1583,"Airbnb warning. Just a warning that not all hosts are honest. I recently booked a home in Isla Mujeres in Mexico for the month of February and luckily enough was in Mexico in December and took a day out of my vacation to check out the rental. We hired a local cab driver to help us find the property. We not only never found the house but the street it was supposed to be on was in a slum and garbage lined the streets, bars on all the windows, nothing even close to the picture on the Airbnb listing. ",5,Antje of Canada
1584,"If you are looking for renting a property through this booking site please read carefully and be aware. Hidden fees - The prices listed seem to be lower compared to some hotels, but that is misleading. Once you get to the check out you all of sudden notice that 1. They charge you booking fee for every day you book - that seems to be % of your booking so it can add up to $80-$100 extra. 2. Many hosts will charge you cleaning fee $30-$35. 3. Many hosts will want you to also pay for electricity and water. 4. Add to that you get no daily service. 5. No free breakfast. 6. No airport shuttle. 7. No 24 hrs front desk service since the host lives usually quite far or in different country. All added up you pay a lot more for the booking than in the hotel.",5,"Michael of Columbia, SC"
1585,I have used AirBnB quite often and never had a complaint. This time the apartment we rented was not owned or rented by the host who listed it on the site. Someone else was occupying it. Seems it was a fraud case. While I had no issues with the AirBnB agent who was forthcoming and supportive it took us nearly two hours to get someone on the phone or chat. All three travelers were trying to contact AirBnB by phone and chat. Every time the system or someone (?) hung up after 40 to 60 minutes of listening to that awful music. Basically if you have a problem you are on your own. After nearly two hours we finally got someone on the line who authorized us to take a hotel which would be reimbursed. I hope that works.,5,"Udo of Denver, CO"

It's basically hidden info on the site while it should be very clear to me before I proceed to have a guest in my house. It's been a few months and the guest is gone and I still can't receive my money (That I started the whole thing because I was in need of it at that time), I can't do that because I don't own a passport and that's the only option they gave me to prove my identity so they made it even harder for me! That's an issue or that's what I think is an issue.",5,"Moustafa of Other, OTHER"

1589,"An Airbnb host cancels unexpected two days prior to the check-in date for a family New Year's celebration. When ""working"" for over four hours with the Airbnb Customer Service, all of whom are shocked that the limited comps are so expensive so close to a major holiday. Airbnb provided poor alternatives for a family trip, stating that other options were too expensive. Their solution was to receive a partial reimbursement after the fact. Not to mention this was after four LONG phone calls and four hours of nothingness. I expected more. My fault for assuming anything good from Airbnb.",5,"Sean of Saint Louis, MO"
1590,"I stayed in an Airbnb in this Nov 2018 for 16 days in a house in Canada, Toronto, Pintail Cres. The host entered my room without permission 3 times, or more. The host's wife, Olxa, informed me at night that the host Darxn was in my room to unplug my MP3 Player. There is no advanced notification for permission to enter my room. On the second last day of my stay, when I came back at night, I found a gift paper wrapped cookie on my desk. Nobody asked for permission to enter the room or notified me after the entering up to this Dec 22, 2018. My concern is that that day I was rushed out for training and forgot to lock my luggage which has my passport, ID cards, credit cards etc important personal info.",5,"Candie of San Jose, CA"
1591,"I have been using Airbnb since 2016. Every time I encountered a problem, Airbnb takes the side of the host irrespective of the circumstances. They also hide or delete bad reviews at the request by the host. My recent experience was, I arrived at this house to find out the place is dirty and had cutlery with food particles on them. The floor infested with ants and there were a few flies, those large ones that appear during summer, in the house. The house was facing the host's backyard and the place was a mess. Due to these shortcomings I immediately notified Airbnb after attempting to contact the host. The Airbnb contacted the host. When the host arrived at the property, they were visibly upset and appeared aggressive. They tried to pick an argument which I tried hard to avoid, which made me really uncomfortable and felt threatened at the time. I was alone at their property and anything could happen when someone is upset.",5,Upul of Australia
1592,They advertise that you can get a refund within 14 days before check-in. Please read the fine print because they don't. They have you pay for half the duration e.g 5 days if you will stay for 10 days. If you cancel after 38 hours but within the 14 days you get nothing back and they still advertise for the days you have paid for that you didn't get a refund. Talk about double payment.,5,Fibi of Other
1593,"We have a trip planned in a week and just received a text cancelling our rental. They offer to refund our money, but getting something in a strange place with one week's notice is not easy. Not only are places more expensive with such short notice, we cannot get a great place for our vacation and have to settle for whatever we can get. Such a disappointment. How is this acceptable when we rented the place two months ago. No apology or explanation. I WILL NEVER TRUST THIS SERVICE AGAIN.",5,"Deborah of Reno, NV"
1594,"We had booked a cabin for 12/28/2018-12/30/2018. Just two weeks before our trip, the host calls that the cabin isn’t available anymore due to the owners selling it, and not giving a 60 day notice. Just two weeks before my family arrives from Florida expecting a cabin, and in the busiest day of the year. There were no other selections in our price range so we don’t get any other cabin for that date due to the others being more expensive. Instead we get a measly credit of $101 for another booking, yet there are none left. This ruined our trip, especially since my family has been going through a hard time lately, and me and my wife wanted to treat them to a relaxing getaway. ",5,"M. of Dayton, TN"
1595,I was visiting Lima Peru and booked a 1 bedroom apartment through Airbnb. (I have used my account with Airbnb in the past without any issue.) Upon arrival I was handed the keys from the landlord. She immediately explained the apartment wasn’t ready at the moment which was fine because I wasn’t going to be returning until The evening So I took the keys and left. I returned around 7 pm with my belongings and noticed the apartment was dirty particularly the bathroom since it clearly showed signs that it hadn’t been cleaned. There was a half used soap in the soap holder of the shower and a very dirty white rug to put your feet on after a shower. There was also no hand soap at all by the sink and there was one hand towel that was moist as if it had already been used. ,5,"Sandra of Hallandale, FL"
1596,The assigned case manager hasn't contacted me for almost 24 hours on a time sensitive issue! They only care about making money and they usually side with the host.

1597,MY AIRBNB ACCOUNT WAS DISABLED FOR NO VALID REASON!!! I was a regular Airbnb user for years until they put my account under review. I've been waiting since about December 2016 for a response on why my account was disabled. I've emailed & called them several times over the wait. They just sent a response December 2018. (TWO YEARS LATER!) Companies love throwing their 'terms of service' at you & telling you what they're not liable for when they are being **. Simply to remind you that they don't care about your frustrations & they are not there for you. ** AIRBNB!,5,"Ian of Brooklyn, NY"

On 8th December after the Paris violent protests, we asked for a cancellation and requested to change our booking to a safer location on 29 Dec. The roads to Ave Macmahon were blocked and metros around there were closed on 8 Dec. Tear gas and water cannons were fired right outside this apartment! After 3 days of email and multiple phone calls Airbnb has denied us a change even though we highlighted that it was unsafe especially for the kids. On their Airbnb website they have listed violence, inaccessibility and safety hazard as conditions for refund. Shouldn't they honor it? Their reply is, ""The host has refused a refund!""",5,Lim of Singapore
1600,"They're a worst. I booked a trip like 5 days ahead. I wanted to cancel it the next day, which is still within 48 hour, since my schedule changed. They won't give me full refund, only 50% of it; they said the cancellation has to be within 48 hours AND 14 days ahead. How stupid is that? How can I have 14 days notice if I just book a room for a trip next week? They told me to go talk to the host as they can't do anything. I wish they're out of business soon. Heard they said they would go public, pray lord. The most irresponsible business model in the world. Use Booking.com instead. They help you cancel full refund even though it's not stated when you booked.",5,"Merry of Sugar Land, TX"

Capital One is trying to stick me with the full amount, even though Airbnb allows the host to not only insult guests that have stayed at her house, but also scam people with her rental, as there are numerous reviews stating that the host has roaches in her rental property. The fact that Airbnb allows this is beyond ridiculous, and Airbnb doesn't take care of its customers. They're in it for the host to rent locations to guests, sight unseen, fake pictures, fake reviews, unsafe locations, and unsanitary situations. Don't waste your money. Get a hotel room, you'll be way better off.",5,"Kristy of Burbank, IL"
1603,"I raised a complaint to the Airbnb customer support team regarding a discriminatory review that I faced with my host. The latter made rude comments about me and gave me a bad public review.

We checked in and we started seeing them everywhere!!! I contacted them and not only did they not move us but they only refunded $120 of the $950 we paid! We had to spend the trip in a cockroach infested place. I called, asked to speak to a manager and they did not care. They closed the case and told me it was my choice to stay there. I have used Airbnb for years and I cannot believe how they treated this situation.",5,"Sarah of Martinez, CA"
1606,I booked a condo for a week in the Philippines and when we arrived to the condo it smelled like mold. The smell was really bad. I left immediately. Could not stay in an apartment that smelled so bad. I contacted Airbnb and asked for a refund. They were on the side of the host and only refunded me half. They did not protect me and were more on the side of the host. I posted a bad review about the host and it was never posted. There was no bad language used just being honest about my experience and it was not posted. No wonder the host has so many good reviews and no negative. I will not trust Airbnb anymore. It's a gamble. Imagine traveling far away and when you get there it's not what you expected. Who has your back because Airbnb won't.,5,"Hector of Union City, NJ"

They declined to protect the host saying guest are free to say what they please so long as they aren't racist. I then explained I was not going to offer the guest money and instead provided Airbnb the plumber's note confirming the radiators were working and the house was above average hot, on top of which the guest had left windows open.

Just today, I wrote a bad review on Airbnb for an awful host and it was removed within the hour. I didn't break the guidelines, they didn't give me a valid reason for removing my review. I just guess that only good reviews sell. That is why I chose that host in the first place (all good reviews)… But if Airbnb removes the bad reviews, you have no way to know. I stopped using Airbnb because Airbnb is nothing without the honest reviews.",5,"Michael of Lebanon, Other"

They did not want to reimburse us and they will not that the listing off, so beware when you plan your next vacation. They also edited your review and only post positive reviews.

1612,"The place I rented did not have the amenities it promised (heated pool) and was dirty. Also the host showed up in our backyard in the dark with a flashlight unannounced during our stay and it made us feel extremely unsafe. So, there is the component of having a host that is dodgy. But the component that compelled me to write this review is the way Airbnb handled my concern. They sided with the host based on his rating overall rather than my individual experience. My experience was uniquely bad but because his reviews were ok from other guests my concern were not addressed and was minimized. There is no direct number to contact Airbnb and so all complaints are logged in an e-mail process. They called me back and that's when I got their number.

Most of the time the electricity in the common areas is blacked out making it impossible to see where you're going and also impossible to know if you are being followed.

While I understand I have a record from when I was young and dumb but if this keeps me from getting a place shouldn't it be looked into before you take my money and give me codes for the house?

I have opened a dispute on Airbnb after 13 days, cause I first wanted to discuss with the guest. Airbnb claimed that it was not done within 14 days. “For cases to be eligible under our Host Guarantee hosts must notify us of the incident within 14 days of checkout or within 24 hours of your next guest’s check-in.”",5,"Luca of Bayonne, NJ"
1625,"I tried to make a reservation for a room rental through Airbnb but their new security procedure prevents it. They require sending a photo ID (driver's license, passport) to them for every reservation. I did so by cell phone but the company rejects photos of my ID with the message: resubmit, photo unclear. I have no problem with other mobile photo transactions so I know the problem is Airbnbs security service contractor. Airbnb customer service can do nothing about it (except waste time).",5,"Kevin of El Cerrito, CA"
1626,Booked accommodation but due to reasons out of my control had to cancel. The accommodation was cancel as we were traveling to Redcliffe to collect a Caravan but the manufacturer moved the Caravan to tweed heads.

How do governments allow this sort of criminal activities to occur.,5,Gordon of Australia
1627,"I'm not even sure where to begin. My girlfriend and I stayed at a cabin in Greenbank Whidbey Island, WA. The water was shut off on us in the midst of a shower and no water worked in the cabin at all. The chimney must not have been cleaned in a century. We were smoked out but the host claimed the wood was wet...which wasn't true. We traveled to Walmart 30 miles away because they left us two huge pieces of wood and nothing to start it with. The wood wasn't wet because it was inside the store. I use my own fireplace quite often.",5,"michelle of Renton, WA"

Can't upload pics of driver's license because site keeps saying the pics are ""too big"" even tho' I kept resizing the pics smaller and smaller. On chat for an hour... Last 30 min got NO replies to messages, so I finally told them to screw it! I had no problems whatsoever booking something this past October... So why all the crap now? So much for trying to save some money on places to stay when I travel now! >:-(",5,"Judy of Parkersburg, WV"

1630,"I was looking to book a condo using Airbnb. This was my first time using their service. I wanted to make sure there were no other fees aside from the total shown during booking so I called the customer service number. I was reassured that there were no other fees to be collected as this was against Airbnb policy. I asked because I saw a mention of taxes were to be collected. I asked the same question and was given the same answer. This was around 11pm at night. The following day, the property manager called me about the taxes due. I called customer service and I was told I was to pay the taxes since it's listed on the website. Well, that's why I called prior to booking. ",5,"C of Houston, TX"

Booking an Airbnb with Nina, Marais district, Paris France, was my first experience at booking an Airbnb, and consequently will be my only experience, booking anything through Airbnb. My trip was schedule and then Hurricane Irma hit (the largest hurricane to hit the state of Florida in history). Nina told me to reschedule but I had to contact her off Airbnb. (I later learned this was so she could still collect my payment and Airbnb would still get their kickback). She let me reschedule and then on the day I was supposed to fly out, she told me she double booked and that I would have to stay at a different location, for which she refused to disclose details.",5,"Sarah of Vero Beach, FL"
1633,Beware booking with Airbnb far in advance of your trip. I just booked an apartment in Malta for a month in March and they charged me the full amount on Nov 7th rather than a deposit and the balance in February. When I phoned Customer Service there is of course nothing they can do. Just be careful when booking - make sure you are pre-approved for the rental then you will have the option of 2 payments.,5,Fred of Canada

We were told to take pictures to prove the bedbug. We took several pictures and sent them to the owner and Airbnb. We were told that the owner had supposedly taken care of the problem but my wife and my grandkids were bitten all over by the bed bugs. We were told that we should have reported it as soon as we got bit. We waited a couple of days to make sure what they were. We were offered a whole 10% off the rental rate. We will have bills for fixing our house and the houses of our children and their kids. I will never use this service again due to way we were treated.

When I came home later that day it was raining in my garage, the bathroom is right above the garage. He caused a lot of damage to my home and had the nerve to leave me a bad review. I contacted Airbnb support about the damage and the review, they put a case manager on my claim and his dishonest review, they will not support me as a host or remove the review.

The owner was not helpful at all, actually he was slightly hostile. And of course I didn't get some of the money back that I have paid. When I came home I was going to write a scathing review of this place but oh no. I had two weeks to do it they said, but after a few days it was too late. I contacted Airbnb about the review/deadline but that was like talking to a wall. It's extremely hard to get any response and when they finally answer they are of no help at all.

After a week, Airbnb did no do ANYTHING for me regarding this issue and they just cancel my reservation without any support. They let the host do whatever they want to the customers and they do not give any support to their customers. They even do not have any review system in their website after they cancel your reservation.

1639,"I complained to Airbnb about cockroaches in my Toquerville, Utah, rental. The owner didn’t take accountability and Airbnb sides with her. They said they would only give me 1/2 of my money back, which I still have yet to see, because the roach photos I sent “didn’t prove an infestation."" What??? I didn’t realize a few cockroaches are a-ok when hosting tenants! (There were more than a few, but my pictures showed only several at once.)  Airbnb should be consumer-based, rather than siding with their hosts so much, judging by the other reviews.

I asked if there was a lot nearby. He assured me that the neighborhood was safe and that we could get both our cars in his driveway. Ok, cool.",5,"Kim of Youngstown, OH"
1641,So I moved provinces in Canada and before my son and I could settle down we booked into a *5 Star superhost* apartment in Toronto for 31 days. The pics were of a different apartment. The place was filthy dirty. The stove almost burnt us and the microwave was broken. The owner was out of the country and realized that he was renting the place and then *renting as an Airbnb* when he was away or staying at his girlfriend's. The owner of the place I mean my host's landlord one time stopped me and asked me what I was doing in his building.

We contacted the host and waited 24+ hours for an answer. We also contacted Airbnb, they were useless. The case manager was rude and did not offer any help other than to file a complain and to email pictures. We requested a refund and she denied our request. They took the word of the host over ours. Never again. STAY AWAY.",5,"Belinda of Oviedo, FL"

Owners also did an oops and left the door to their hoarder room open, and then didn’t even have our room ready. I couldn’t get out quick enough and went to battle with Airbnb. They were difficult and wanted to charge 1/2 due to us “cancelling”. I insisted on sending pics to justify why we should get full refund. If I hadn’t taken pics, I’m sure I would have had to pay.

1647,"The additional fees are a rip-off. In the end the total costs work out more expensive than staying at a good reliable hotel in more central location. Got charged $99 service fees and $60 cleaning fees on top of $600 accommodation fee for 4 nights stay in a small apartment in Shinjuku. When I found a good 3 star hotel with breakfast included at a more Tokyo central location, which is also part of Qantas travel program, I attempted cancelling the Airbnb reservation, only to find out that you could only do this on a computer not on your phone or iPad, and that the service fee is not refundable because it was already more than 48 hours when I made the booking. I felt extremely frustrated because it said nowhere when I made the booking that the service fee is non-refundable after 48 hours. Literally a ripoff and a scam.

But really the worst was when we went to bed. After some minutes we realized the smell, and then it dawned on us that we were sleeping in very used sheets/bed covers/pillow cases. The next day we reported it to the owner, by Whatsapp, and he came and removed the rug, and attempted to change the linen, but he is a young lawyer, and had never changed a bed in his lifetime, so my wife ended up doing it.",5,christian of Argentina

I have a print screen of that conversation as well. I stopped hearing from him and the next person told me there was no bug and he misspoke and has been reprimanded.

No bowls in the cabinets, microwave filthy, etc. When I confronted the host I was told he had fired the maid and would be cleaning himself. No cleaning occurred despite the fact this was a shared bathroom and guests came and went. On a Sunday night, host had a party until 4 a.m. in which all the Airbnb guests stood in the hallway asking him to turn the music down. I moved out 1 week early and requested a full refund of unused days and supplied pictures of my issues.

We told the host we would not be arriving until around midnight. He said no problem, just call when we got there and he would provide us a code to get in the door. When we arrived in Jersey City at midnight, I called Jason (the host) and got no answer. The neighborhood seems very sketchy. I had to call 5 or 6 times before he answered and gave us a code. We got into the place and it was about 95 degrees maybe more. There was no A/c in the apartment as described in the ad. There was 2 towels for 2 guys who were staying for 4 nights.

1657,"We reserved an Airbnb in Washington DC about 10 months before trip. While travelling, Airbnb cancelled our booking about 1 week prior to that visit... Reason? Because the house owner was not complying, with their rules... They were warned 3 times... Did not comply so were taken off the site. Instead of penalizing the apartment themselves they actually penalised us more as we are stuck with nowhere to stay. The American office then emailed us to give us other choices of accommodation then booked it for us. We are Canadian so unknowingly they booked it in US dollars without telling us. That was a natural mistake as the agent didn't even think of that. But for us it meant another 30% increase. Their office would not do anything, even was going to penalise us for cancelling. We will never use their service again.",5,"Stan of Kelowna, Canada"

They have a very poor interface with your local government, and when something goes wrong will not warn you in advance. Instead, they'll just cancel all your upcoming visitors. That'll BE your notice that something has gone wrong. You'll have to email your local government to find out what the actual problem is, because Airbnb's tech isn't good enough to determine the problem and convey it to you.

We got kicked out of our room on Sunday to accommodate the incoming guests.

They are a website and nothing else. Many other Real Estate sites to choose from with the same properties that don't rob customers and then hide from their Customer Service responsibility. Absolute tragedy paying as much money as I did for literally nothing. Be careful with expensive booking...

It was very obvious that the woman who stayed there over the weekend threw a party that got out of hand. We submitted pictures and invoices to Airbnb letting them know the damages and proof of what we paid in repairs. Airbnb declined to hold the woman accountable and/or help us to cover any of the costs themselves, with no explanation why. Since then, I’ve decided that the risk of allowing strangers to stay in my home is too risky when the company who is supposed to protect your home doesn't do the right thing.

Once we crossed this hurdle, I won't deny that your teams did try to assist us in finding listings we had already found on our own many times over (you have a very big staff, I may have spoken to more than half of them).

I again reiterated that these were 1-2 night stays. AirBnB responded that I had agreed to 10% discount for customers"".

Bank of America says Airbnb has to do a chargeback to retrieve the money and then refund to the correct card. Airbnb wrote that they DO NOT DO CHARGEBACKS. It is how their system is set up.

1669,"I am both a guest and host. For the most part Airbnb has been a good experience. However I have found they did not protect their hosts. I'm guessing maybe due to who pays them. I clearly offered a strict nonsmoking condo. My guest stayed 2-3 weeks and smoked inside the condo the entire time, to the point the cleaning crew went twice after their stay to try and remove the strong odor of cigarette smoke. In addition I had to change all filters, and clean any fabric, curtains, sofa, chairs, rugs, etc. that absorbed smoke.

I told them the changes had been made before I was locked out and the account is now set up and working. I have had no reply from them.

When we contacted the site about this issue and how unsafe it was they did nothing about it. The host refused to refund any of the money even though we did not stay at cabin. I asked the site to look into this and they choose not to listen to me. The host called me a liar and said that any vehicle could make it to the location. I am out over $700 with no help from the site. It took them over 2 weeks to respond to my claim. The initial email that they sent me said that they would have it resolved in 72 hours.

Therefore I called Airbnb and by the first conversation the attendant wasn't helpful at all, he didn't know what to answer then he put the call on hold for several minutes. In the end he said ""you should be fine"" & that he would set the system to refund me the full price I paid (€946,71) minus the fee (€133,96), which I agreed. He also confirmed that €812,75 was the amount refundable.",5,"Luciana of Dublin, Other"
1675,"I have been hosting with them for almost 5 years, and have 2 very successful listings. I had a guest who they let cancel over the phone after the check in time (I had already paid a cleaning lady) and then allowed that person to give me a bad review. How will someone who cancelled and never even saw my place give me a 1 star review for cleaning? I keep asking them to take it down but no, the same robotic answer, ""It doesn't violate our policies."" They are impossible to get in touch with, you can't call them only they can call you. Terrible support and this guest was a first time Airbnb user, then today I get an email saying I won't be featured in searches because I got a bad review. Really not happy with the support after all the money I am making them.",5,"Laura of Charlotte, NC"
1676,"Airbnb sends email reminder to review your stay, which is good but misleading. My email reminder was ""Sep 14 is the last day you can review your stay..."" I went on to review the stay only to realize I couldn't. I called customer service & after speaking to 3 persons I then was told that it's at the time you checked out that your review was until then 14 days after. Yes I knew was 14 days after but had no clue was the time of checkout. Had I known this or if the email was clearly stated I could have review on time cause the homeowners were very great with us during our stay. The email reminder should had stated more clearly since that was the main purpose. As with any other company, the date I expected was at the end of the day. My intention was to give a 5 star review for the stay.",5,"Neil of South Richmond Hill, NY"
1677,"I recently stayed at an Airbnb property in Hong Kong. When I arrived, the floor was had noticeable shards of glass across the floor, the kitchen has roaches and bathroom had other bugs, washing machine was broken, kitchen door handle kept falling off, shower knob fell off and place was just dirty overall. I worked with a case manager at Airbnb who promised me a refund on the phone after the stay was over. After the stay ended, I contacted Airbnb and they basically said that they never agreed to anything at all despite the apartment was in violation of safety and cleanliness Airbnb policies.",5,"Jason of Chestnut Hill, MA"
1678,"Airbnb is a terrible customer service experience. They told my guest they will refund them without my permission. They had the guest occupy the space, agreed to the guest’s unreasonable request to get refunded and forcibly took money from my account. What did guest bring as an excuse? That the place wasn’t empty of my personal belongings. Like ** grow up and know this is a house not a hotel. Take your cheap ** to the hotel. Airbnb customer care is pure ** people with no appreciation that they are making money out of other people property. They believe they are obligated to issue refund and it is all at the cost of the host. I certainly like to sue them for this and love to get advice on how to do so. Customer care never responds and always promises to call you back but never does.",5,"Hami of Chicago, IL"
1679,Refused to re-issue a refund to updated payment method. Refund is in limbo from the merchant to the bank ping-ponging back-and-forth and Airbnb refused to put the refund on the new payment method or mail us a check. They left in my face and refused to let me speak to a supervisor.,5,"Andrea of Palm Bay, FL"
1680,"Posted your letter along with my response to our Facebook account and to our FOX NEWS affiliates in D.C. Our hope is that tens of thousands of Airbnb users will be as enraged by your flagrant violation and use of personal information as we are. Needless to say, it is doubtful we'll never hear from you. After all, we are the Deplorables and you are the all knowing, the elitists... called to correct our ignorant ways.",5,"Rob of Tampa, FL"
1681,Just saw a story on the local news where Airbnb double booked another family. Thought I would share my story. They did the same thing to me back in Colorado this past June 2018. Never bothered to tell me the house had been double booked. Only way I found out was I saw credit on my credit card statement and I called. Neither Airbnb or host bothered to call and tell me. I had one month to scramble to try to find another house that accepted 2 dogs and everything was booked. I finally found one. No thanks to Airbnb and all they offered was $25 off. This company sucks and I will never do business with them again.,5,"Tanya of Bay City, TX"
1682,"I signed up to be a host -- had to cancel (in plenty of time) due to extenuating circumstances. The guest was fine with it. Airbnb charged me $100, and it was totally unclear when I canceled that this charge would later be levied. This is a very shady company and I would recommend not doing business with them.",5,"Cal of Syracuse, NY"
1683,"Absolutely the WORST company I've ever dealt with. When our host kicked us out for even daring to call Airbnb due to discrepancies in his listing, as well as having his wife verbally harass and threaten us, Airbnb did absolutely nothing. Completely unhelpful. They did give us a refund and an extra $40 but, at that point, everything in the area was booked or was 300+ a night. They didn't help us find another place to stay, leaving us without a home in Vancouver (we had to sit at the airport for 5 hours, refreshing the page to find another host), and only made matters worse by deciding to contact the wife AFTER we had expressed our concern for our safety. ",5,"Rebekah of Boise, ID"
1684,"After staying at the Airbnb quite frequently while I was still looking for a permanent place in the new place I have moved to I started noticing that they will do ""anything"" to keep their business going. 1. They are not allowing any guest to stay continuously in a best ranked homes so that their service fee will add up. 2. They are not checking or validating the safety of the homes and they claim that they are not responsible for any unsafe condition of the homes in the listing. ",5,"Anitha of Charlotte, NC"
1685,"My family and I with three kids aged between 1 and 8 years arrived to this ""resort"" yesterday. Immediately we noticed how ruined down the place was. Nothing like the pictures. We decided to walk around and see the rest of the facilities, the family pool in particular breaks any health and safety regulation, I have never seen anything like this before. So, the pool is located next to a drop of at least 50 meters, the edge of the pool (where your kids are meant to walk while playing) has nothing dividing the edge and the pool. If anyone falls into that drop someone will get seriously hurt. Having seen this we decided not to stay.",5,"Jorge of Great Britain, Other"
1686,"When arriving at the Airbnb in London, the room was still not cleaned at the check in time. I let the owner know and he said the maid said it was cleaned but I was there and it was not; towels on the floor, bed with dirty linens, completely not cleaned. 30 min. Later still no maid and no clean room, so I left letting the owner know I was leaving not to return. I did not receive a complete refund because they say I didn't cancel and I didn't have proof of the dirty room. This was my first attempt with Airbnb and my last.",5,"Laura of Charlottesville, VA"
1687,"We had booked a place to stay but had to cancel within 24 hours of making the booking because a few guests that were coming with us had to pull out. The terms and conditions stated we would be given a full refund in circumstances where bookings were cancelled within 48 hours. It has been four weeks later, four phone calls to Airbnb's customer service and several attempts to contact them on their feedback page but without luck. We are getting increasingly frustrated that the deposit has not been refunded, but what is worse is that the staff at Airbnb don't care. Terrible terrible terrible! Will never use again and advise you to do the same.",5,Steven of Australia
1688,I spent a lot of time finding and booking a condo. The host asked a silly question that I did not immediately respond to because I was busy. The host canceled my reservation because I did not immediately respond to his stupid question.,5,"Nancy of Golden, CO"
1689,"We have used Airbnb a lot in the past, but this time it was disgusting. Often, Airbnb rentals can be good - but more frequently than it should be, the rentals are not clean. In this case the sheets smelled, and there was visible hair - from the previous renter. We came in late, and Italy was having a heat wave; previously, my wife had gotten heat stroke, so we were just exhausted. So we did not report it to Airbnb right away. Since we waited, Airbnb refuses to help us. Kim, in their customer support department, is not sympathetic at all.",5,"Kevin of Campbell, CA"
1690,"I referred another host to Airbnb before I had sufficient experience with their customer disservice department. I was promised in writing a $300 referral fee. This promise appeared on my referral page. All of the customer service people have stated that I am either an idiot or a liar and that this was only a progress bar. The notification on my page said you will receive your money in 15 business days not that my money was pending. Then after complaining to a customer service rep who denied I was entitled to the money I received an email saying, ""Don't lose hope refer another host to get a referral fee."" Having been defrauded one time why would I try it again? There is no way to directly contact the actual department that handles problems.",5,"Erica of Brooklyn, NY"
1691,"I booked a room on Airbnb in Brooks, Maine. It said a ""loft"" on a farm. What I found was a dilapidated run down farmhouse with an attic space. A broken down fridge on the back porch, a door with a missing window pane and a filthy kitchen with piles of clothes. The room was almost 90 degrees so I turned on the a/c that was in the room. It blew out cold in front and hot in the back. It was a sauna. So I call Airbnb after speaking to our nonexistent hosts. What did I get - ""Well you should have taken pics."" I said it was 9 pm and I took pics of the room temperature and how the ""loft"" had no privacy door - forget a lock. ",5,"Graciela of Jackson, WY"
1692,I had to cancel my vacation and no longer will need Airbnb accommodations. I canceled within the 48 hrs of cancellation policy and the host is refusing to give me a full refund. The host is not honoring the 48 hrs cancellation and full refund policy.,5,"Maris of Boca Raton, FL"
1693,"We rented a home in an area near Omaha Nebraska. It looked very nice. The basement was storage and off limits. No problem, we paid hundreds of dollars for four nights and yay! In the first ten minutes we figure out the basement is inhabited by a drunk guy who does maintenance. He left the basement door ajar weaving his truck past our car in the driveway to get away then drove up and down the street. Really scary when he parked pointed into the backyard. Got pictures of piles of booze bottles etc. ",5,"walter of Mesa, AZ"
1694,"As of this writing Airbnb and one of their partner hosts, Jacks Realty in West Palm Beach, Fl. have not refunded my money amounting to near $1,600. I booked a rental which turned out to be a health hazard and death trap which is typical of a slumlord type property. We could not stay in the place as it was so unfit and had to find a hotel in the area. I sent many photos as proof of my claim and Airbnb ignored them. The unit was not fit for human habitation and to say the least not as advertised. The property had just been fumigated with signs posted as warnings to occupants.",5,"Ronald of Palm Beach Gardens, FL"
1695,Airbnb gave one of my guests a 50% refund - without my permission - because two hornets came into the property. The reason given was that I had not disclosed in advance that an animal was present. Hosts should be aware that Airbnb can refund with no good reason. I will be taking legal advice.,5,Caroline of US
1696,Nothing but terrible experiences with Airbnb and their “services.” To say the least this company has poor customer service and does not take any responsibility for any mishaps that occur at their venues. They don’t care about their customers whatsoever or the fact that the places they post on their site could be a scam. They don’t check out any of the venues they post on their site to see if they are legit and meet their standards. ,5,Erin of USA
1697,"I had made a reservation at an Airbnb in Quincy, IL. When I got to the place it was filthy dirty. I took about 50 pictures of the place, then sent a note to the host that I would not be staying and also contacted Airbnb with the situation and sent them pictures. After 6 weeks of trying to get my money back nothing has happened except for me getting the run around from Airbnb. The bedroom garbage can was full, bed looked like it was slept in. The towel and wash rags they left in my room for use we’re all stained green and yellow. ",5,"Vicki of Usa, USA"
1698,"I have book a home to stay with my family of 5 in Canada but after 2 weeks we have found mice in home and inform Airbnb about it. They cancelled our staying home agreement without relocating us somewhere else. Actually recommended us a place 2000 mm always where we stayed. (Recommended from Ontario to Nova Scotia by a case manager, which I have proof in my email).",5,"Veysel of Usa, USA"
1699,"We booked a home through Airbnb and paid the required amount. The next day payment was canceled by Airbnb and we were asked to contact customer service. We did so and the customer service staff we talked to was unfriendly and unprofessional. He did not give us enough details as to why the payment was canceled, especially after it had gone through flawlessly 24 house earlier with the same house. Clearly there was a glitch at their end, but once confronted, they did not give any satisfactory answer and instead canceled the account. As far as we are concerned, they don't have decent customer service skills. They need a lot of improvement and training on basic human service.",5,"E. of Nairobi, Other"
1700,"I rented a boat (a 1980 Chris Craft) at the Jersey Shore (Wildwood, NJ). When we first arrived the boat was not was we expected it to be. However, I was ready for the adventure and was willing to overlook the lack of basic necessities as a result. But as time when on, we discovered there were many problems with the boat, for example we had no running water for the first week we were there, the host did not empty the commode from the previous guest prior to our arrival as he told me he still needed to do that (we arrived a day late so he had plenty of time to do this). It was more than a week after we arrived that he finally tended to the toilet and only after we complained of the stench on the boat as a result. ",5,"Cindy of Philadelphia, PA"
1701,"Customer Service is unhelpful and degrading. Had an issue with a service they provided, which was a clear violation of their terms and policies, but the customer service agents failed to recognize it. And after several messages, just stopped responding. Seems like they will say anything to get out of actually providing real help.",5,"Benjamin of Los Angeles, CA"
1702,"We have used Airbnb for the first time. We booked an apartment in Prague in August 2018. We were happy with the apartment... nice and clean, well equipped and quite central. Metro station, supermarkets and various restaurants at walking distance. The hosts were very helpful before we arrived at the apartment. However, things changed drastically once we arrived there. The apartment was so hot! We were fully aware that there was no air conditioning in the apartment and it happened to be a heatwave. So, we asked for two extra big fans (or at least one more) as there was only one small fan since the apartment was simply unbearable to stay in. ",5,"Kenneth of L-Imtarfa, Other"
1703,On 24 July I requested a booking for 7 days with Airbnb. It was refused by the owner but AU $400 was still deducted from my PayPal account. Airbnb promised (by email) a refund within 7 days. Today is August 14 and still no refund. Any suggestions as to a course of action?,5,"Dianne of Paradise Waters, Other"
1704,"First of all I’m sure there are amazing things about Airbnb, I was just unfortunate and didn’t have a great experience! We booked a stay through Airbnb for my dad's 50th birthday... the information included “sleeps 8 and has 3 bedrooms”. You could clearly see two rooms had queen beds, but then the 3rd looked like two twins beds. The host confirmed that it was twin beds, so I assumed (it sleeps 8) there must be a pull out couch. Thinking two couples could stay in the queen rooms, we could sleep on the pull out couch and my toddler (age 2) could sleep in the room with two twin beds.",5,"Caitlin of Gander, NL"
1705,"Rude and unreliable. You might get lucky and have a good experience but you lose your hard earned money if you are not. Airbnb doesn’t take responsibility of an ill maintained home. Don’t go for it. I ended up in a listing where my father and I got sick within an hour of getting in because it smelled so bad, old and dusty. There was evidence of rodent infestation and the host sounded pretty unapologetic about it! I had to leave and go to a hotel. Upon contacting Airbnb they said since I didn’t give the host “a chance to fix the issues” I won’t be given any refund. Like, how can you fix the first impression of a guest who sees a book eaten at the corner by a rodent in a home you paid for?! Doesn’t it imply that you don’t maintain the house like you should have and now that you are caught, you want to try covering up? I didn’t get my money back - my hard earned money, but I am writing the review so that it can help at least one person!",5,"Piya of Column, OH"
1706,"When I was looking to book a stay, Airbnb's website said I would not be charged at booking, which I wanted because I wanted to pay in cash. Well, I was charged. I canceled right away thinking I did something wrong, re-booked, and was charged a second time. I kept the second reservation. I also noticed I did not receive my $40 credit for being referred. My referring friend did not receive her $20 credit either. I tried contacting Airbnb which is a complete JOKE!!! If you're fluent in English, expect to not receive a fluent speaking associate if they even feel like returning your call at all. I was told my account has been activated for 2 years therefore, I was not eligible for a credit. ",5,"Sarah of Sheffield Lake, OH"
1707,"When booking rentals through Airbnb. There isn't any explanations about the ""type"" cancellation your HOST has on their property, until you cancel, then that is when you find out WHAT TYPE you have on your stay. The site doesn't say 50% of the TOTAL RENTAL FEE DUE (even though you may have only paid the 1/2 that is required to hold your reservation), it just says 50% refund. Airbnb site also says cleaning fees are ALWAYS refunded, but that hasn't been the case either. VERY DISAPPOINTED in this as to I had 2 separate reservations I just cancelled (1 was not my choice but the other was because of this situation), lost $981.70 (only refunded $12.77 of $875.40 reservation and $31.68 of $1088 reservation))!!! GUYS, this is so unfair!!! RIDICULOUS!!",5,"Wendy of Alexandria, AL"
1708,"I booked an apartment in Toronto on July 6, for six days in August. My account was charged for half the amount of the rental. Without notification, my reservation was cancelled. I only learned of this when I checked the Airbnb website yesterday, a few days before check in. I contacted Airbnb Customer Service, and after several attempts, I spoke to a representative. The representative said the host had cancelled (the host said Airbnb had cancelled). There was no explanation as to why, or why I hadn't been contacted. The representative said she was sending the file to a case manager in her group and I would hear from them. I haven't heard anything, even though I have followed up with the representative twice. Because it is so close to check in, it cost me 40% more to book a comparable apartment. Airbnb doesn't take responsibility for anything---it should be regulated the way hotels are. They should be accountable.",5,"Robert of Seattle, WA"
1709,"I am currently visiting England from the US. Today, I found out that due to a “glitch” in their system Airbnb has cancelled my accommodations for tomorrow. I am now in a foreign country with no place to stay. I spent ALL day on the phone with them and they do completely admit it’s their fault. The case managers and supervisor said they were going to call me back and then they never did. They insisted on corresponding only through messaging on their app and would just stop responding. This has been an awful experience and after 6 hours they just texted me a $100 coupon. As if that could possibly make up for what they’ve done. I will NEVER use Airbnb again.",5,"Erin of Philadelphia, PA"
1710,"Wow! After $877.00 later, hours on the phone, lots of correspondence with the Airbnb Caseworker, who can’t even seem to figure out how many days we actually booked or what actually happened, I’m amazed at the incompetence. I took photos of everything to prove our case. The place looked nothing like the photos and had not been kept up or maintained at all. Airbnb is not even able to negotiate with the host on behalf of a 5 star rated guest with Vacasa, a real estate company who is listing on Airbnb as a “host” who is mismanaging 91 thousand properties as stated by the host when we contacted them immediately upon arrival to the nightmare location. In all our years of traveling the world, we’ve never experienced anything like it. ",5,"Lydia of Flowery Branch, GA"
1711,"I have usually been satisfied by the accommodations from Airbnb. Not this time. We were located close to the California town of Visalia. After a long drive, we checked in (Airbnb near Sequoia National Park). To our horror, the air conditioning was not working, and it was 100 degrees outside. Fortunately, they fixed it partially the next day. But then a swarm of ants and many mice greeted us. We left the place early. Clearly the home was not maintained at all. If you can't find a park lodge to live in, don't go at all. The distances are long and the Airbnb homes are not habitable.",5,"Godfrey of Long Beach, CA"

1713,"As their new update policy, they force us to accept it and upload our government issued ID for identity verification. But they do not mention how they can protect our ID from being stolen. I don't believe they have this ability. Besides, including Amazon and any other website, no one ever requires government ID, they should not have the right to do so. It's unfair policy for customers.

I would NOT recommend this business to anyone as it seems they back the hosts but do nothing for the patrons.",5,"Paula of Clarksville, TN"
1715,"Guest showed up late, locked herself out and refused to take a full refund and go someplace else. Guest trashed me and the place and claimed things completely false or lies with the exception except perhaps in brain, obviously with issues!

I used the 48-hour-cancel-for-free filter, and upon receiving the street address to the reserved listing, my 83-year-old mother determined the location was unfortunately too far from downtown for her to be able to walk to & from. So I cancelled this reservation within the 48 hours of having booked it and booked a different (and much more expensive) listing closer to downtown. To my surprise, my 48-hour-cancel-for-free refund did not include the $160.95 service fee, which I took to be a clear error on Airbnb’s part, as nowhere on their 48-hour-cancel-for-free filter is it specified that the service fee is non-refundable.

We canceled 2 months early, he can easily rerent the condo in Gulf Shores, Al. We were told there won't be a refund. That's not right, we were told to expect a refund the 26th of July, now today they said no refund.

1720,"As a new Airbnb user, I had some difficulty with two bookings. I had to cancel and rebook. I did rebook and followed thru with the booking. They counted those cancellations against me. My family had me book a family get together and when one of the grandsons was unable to come, they asked me to cancel the reservation. It was expensive. I talked to the homeowner, when I did the booking, explaining that I would cancel, if necessary, within a week, so that he would not lose the opening.

1723,"Airbnb has no idea what a homeowner has to do in order to keep the home in perfect condition for the next client. And they do not care. As long as they advertise your property and take the money. My personal contract for our beach house clearly states that trashing the house or backyard is unacceptable and carries extra fees for cleaning. However, if you ever got your house or backyard dirty and trashed, to a point that it needs double time for the cleaning service to make it ready for the next client, you cannot get any extra payment - Airbnb claims that since there is no physical damage, they do not charge extra. On top of that, the communications from their agent are sharp, negative and totally inappropriate. My tenants had the backyard full of beer cans for 2 full days, and we had to clean it on Sunday. On my expense. I HAVE TAKEN MY PROPERTY OFF THEIR LIST. We have other agencies we work with who appreciate our business.",5,"Lia of Bethesda, MD"
1724,"I had an account years ago that I used with no problem. I tried to log in today to find accommodations in Charleston, SC. The AirBNB site insisted I verify my account and suggested I do so through my cell phone. When I downloaded the phone app, the site wanted permission to access my contacts. REALLY!!?? For what possible legitimate purpose? No other booking site has ever asked me for that kind of access. The next step in the process would have been to send a copy of the front & back of my driver's license, passport or visa. I DON'T THINK SO!!! Can you spell: ""Identification theft""???

The outside AC unit/compressor hadn't been serviced or cleaned in years as was evidenced by the build up of dirt around the vented metal panel that allows access to the capacitors.

On 7/24/2018 we reverified our identities and we were reassured that once the transmittal from SSA was received funds would be available immediately. We received no notification or account alert of any ""unusual activity"" unless they count the numerous logins the past 72 hours. Who does not check their account constantly when bills are due. We received creditor extensions due to a security breach at our previous bank. This account ending card ending in ** had always been a mere back up account.",5,"ROBERT of Keller, TX"
1728,Unpractical refund/cancellation policy. If canceled within 14 business days and owner is able to rent the unit refunds should be given. How is it that you have strict cancellation policy that only allows a consumer to cancel within 48 hours for a full refund when booked 3 months in advance. It’s best to use Airbnb for short notice hotel reservations. Otherwise you are screwed if owner decide to implement “strict refund policy” and will not accommodate unforeseen circumstances! I’ll stick with hotels going forward! Airbnb app DELETED!!!,5,"Shany of Houston, TX"
1729,"I have only used Airbnb one time, in January 2018. About a week ago - July 2018 I noticed a charge for 156.01 with a confirmation number on my Visa dated June 29. I contacted Airbnb and after taking down my information I was told I would be refunded. When I asked how this would have happened, seeing as how I have no payment options saved on my account and my card hadn’t been compromised. I was told they would only release that information under government subpoena. I’m deleting my account.",5,"Matthew of Krestova, BC"
1730,"I found recently especially that as a traveler, you feel intense pressure to only give, at worse, a lukewarm review or none at all. A few things everyone should know... your credit card is ""held hostage"" by Airbnb up to 2 weeks after your stay, in case host wants to accuse you of damages. How do we know they won't come up with some made-up problem if they don't like your review? I currently am debating on how to review a host who I can tell from prior reviews takes GREAT offense at ANY negative comments or suggestions. ",5,"Jane of Carlsbad, CA"
1731,I HAVE NEVER USED AIR BNB - Today I check my bank account so that I can get gas and pick up groceries only to find fraudulent charges on my account. I spoke with Toni only to find that this company only confers with email!!! My information can only be expedited and someone will email me!!! Really?? How can this company stay in business??? I have barely seen any good reviews. This business is nothing but a fraud!!!,5,"Audrey of Staten Island, NY"
1732,"What you are about to read you most likely will not believe. This is truly a script for a movie. This is my firsthand experience with not just Airbnb but many life lessons in a very short amount of time. I hope this helps at least 1 person. In mid-June 2018, I decided to relocate from Northern New Jersey to the Palm Beach County area in Florida. The past year and half I experienced the loss of my father on January 11, 2017, the loss of my mother on January 2, 2018, job loss, fighting for unemployment for months, fighting for jobs, fighting to save my apartment and not get evicted for 8 months straight, having my entire network hacked by a family member who destroyed my business that I put years into building, attacked me in front of my mother 4 days before she went into open-heart surgery... the list goes on.",5,"M. of Hackensack, NJ"
1733,"I had 4 charges come out of my account this week and this is day 3 of calling Airbnb and being told their fraud department would call me to take care of this and no one has called. When I call the company they won't even talk to me without me giving them the last 4 digits of my debit card. I will not give them this information - I just had fraud committed on my account, why would I give them more financial information. I just spent another hour on the phone with Sheldon and Arvie and I not absolutely no help. Very sure I will never use this company again.",5,"Cindy of Goldendale, WA"
1734,"I rented out my apartment to a guest. He broke a bed. I gathered the evidence that Airbnb required, they agreed to pay. They then rescinded their offer, no explanation. They also kept the damage/breakages insurance from the guest. That seems like fraud to me? Do not trust Airbnb.",5,"Stephen of Stratford Upon Avon, Other"
1735,"After reading the 15-- 5 Star post and that the host was a Superhost we decided to Rent 911 Riverview Drive, Bullhead City for 4 nights. In the info pack that was sent we were told that the a/c was to be set to 75 degrees prior to our arrival- home was 96 degrees and a/c was off and it took from 5:30 in the evening until 11:30 at night to get temp down to a balmy 88. There were ants in the house, the flooring was torn out in the Kitchen, dining, living and bedrooms and basically a poorly stained and not very clean concrete floor. The oven (see photo) was one of the dirtiest we have ever come across (also the dishes- see photo) so we fixed no meals at the house (one of the reasons you rent a vacation rental). ",5,"Ron of Temecula, CA"
1736,"I booked 3 nights stay with Airbnb in Florida. We stayed at an addition room from the main house, which is the owner live. The host is a nice man, no complaints! The reasons that I am writing this review is about Airbnb. We could not sleep on the first night because of the constant noises from the window ac in the unit, and from the ac condenser on the roof above the unit. We could hear the feel the vibration for the whole night. We tried to turn off the ac unit off, but it was too hot. We decided to leave on the next morning because it will ruin our vacation for the sleepless nights. We contacted the host to let him know our decision and left. We contacted Airbnb to ask for the refund of the remaining nights. They refused and claimed it was our fault to leave. If you are not happy with the products or services, it is our right to refuse to pay, although we were willing to pay for the first sleepless night! Airbnb just lost one customer!",5,"Loc of Garden Grove, CA"
1737,"Reserved a place in Seattle two months ago for a trip that is now two weeks away. Got an email yesterday (less than two weeks from planned trip) saying that my background check didn't go through because of a criminal record. I have no criminal record. Needless to say I disputed it through the background check company they use and it was a simple mistake, same name, birthday and state, different person completely. They reversed their background check within two hours and my background check came back clean. ",5,"Joshua of Tallahassee, FL"
1738,"We just stayed in the Palmer House in New Orleans. One of the beds was infested with wood beetles. We told our Super Host and she told us “they won’t bother you”. She never said “sorry” or “what can I do to make this right."" What she did say was let me sweep up the sawdust pile the beetles left on the floor. The couple staying in that room slept on the floor the next night. The next day when she saw the air mattress the floor she let us know “that we are from the north and just don’t understand bugs."" Not even an offer to get an exterminator in. Following Airbnb policy, we notified them when the issue happened. They notified the landlord and she promptly ordered us out of her lovely home. She even threatened to call the police. ",5,"Vicki of Medina, OH"
1739,Airbnb is the most unprofessional and rude business that I ever came across in my entire life. They cancel people's reservations without advised them and without their approval. They like to spin and span their customers as they're pleased. They cancelled our reservations few days before our vacation to Italy. They were trying to get me for more money and give me different places. Of course a lot more expensive. I would urge you to stay away from these crooked people and please spread the word and let good people know how bad is Airbnb organization. ,5,"Nino of Gilroy, CA"
1740,I am very upset and angry with the host referral programme. I have invited 4 hosts. And I have helped them to create their account. I gave a lot of time and effort. They have promised 250 for each hosts and gave only 86 euro for the first 2. And for the other 2 they told me the hosts I referred did not used the link I have sent while I am the one who clicked the links and create the accounts to help them. I really hope developers will create a new and ethical platform for hosts.,5,"Gözde of Athens, Other"
1741,"I changed my phone number 3 years ago. Went to login into Airbnb account and from my computer and it said it had to verify my identity by sending me a text to my old phone number. Then locked me out of the account because I don't have that phone. No way to update phone number. No way to contact customer service because account is locked and they cannot be contacted without an account. Contacted them with a new account I created and the only response I got was an apology for how I ""felt"" but they apparently refuse to solve the problem or update the phone number. Two weeks have passed. Nothing. Apparently they are so profitable that servicing their paying customers is no longer a necessity.",5,"Gary of Seattle, WA"
1742,"Booked an Airbnb in Los Angeles CA a month before my vacation. My family flew into Las Vegas from MD then drove to Los Angeles, a four hour drive. An hour prior to our arrival the host sends a text stating there are issues with the apartment. He suggests another one of his properties but is smaller that has only has 1 bedroom. The property we originally booked was a 2 bedroom. We opted for another property with a different host. Arrived at the newly booked property and apartment was not as listed. Listing stated king bed in one bedroom, was actually a queen and the other bedroom was listed as a queen, was actually a full bed. Wasn’t impressed with the unit but tried to make it work. ",5,"Kathy of Millersville, MD"
1743,"I stayed in a house of an extremely conservative Christian Republican. It was so creepy. I think he had the house bugged and he listened to my conversations although I cannot prove it. He was just ok until he heard me without my knowledge having a conversation with my gay boyfriend. Ever since he stopped talking to me and that made me feel so scared. I thought he was going to kick me with guns and everything. But fortunately, he just ignored me which was good. I don't want to be his friend anyway. But my point is that I felt so anxious and stressed because I didn't know if he was going to act violent or what. I was in the middle of nowhere. I didn't have any motel or neighbors nearby. I wouldn't stay in Airbnb anymore. Just going to a stranger house is scary and you don't know what you are going to get, because the reviews are not always accurate.",5,"Pepito of New Bedford, MA"
1744,"I'm a host, Air b and ** is forcing me to take all kinds of people with bad reviews. If I don't take them they penalize me by not showing my property when people search, or they fine me money. Disgusting company. They forcing me to host bad people who don't respect my place or other guests.",5,"James of London, Other"
1745,"I've been trying to book an Airbnb for a night in Monterey, CA. Yes, it is a busy weekend and prices are at a premium. But it's the property owner's responsibility to do their own research on pricing. TWICE now I've booked a home and the price has been changed to a much higher rate - it's a bait and switch. The first time, I was TYPING IN MY CREDIT CARD NUMBER and the price TRIPLED while I was typing. Thank goodness I looked at the total one last time before I clicked to purchase. The second time, I booked and PAID FOR the home and got a confirmation and everything. An hour later, Airbnb contacted me and said the owner ""had a calendar mix up"" and now wanted to charge me double the rate I paid. I protested, but Airbnb cancelled my reservation, refunded my money and gave me a $25 coupon. Which I won't be using. I'll stick to hotels from now on, thanks.",5,"Maggie of Atascadero, CA"
1746,"I used Airbnb for the first time to book a BNB for a planned trip. Airbnb sent a message stating the ""host"" had accepted the booking and then proceeded to bill my credit card for the booking. I made contact with the ""host"" to finalize the details only to be told they knew nothing about me or my booking. They further stated that they had family issues and were not taking any bookings this year. I have made attempts to contact Airbnb but they have no direct contact available and their site tells me to contact the host for a refund. The host was not paid, and as stated knows nothing about a booking. I am still attempting to obtain a full refund, but Airbnb's site policy states a refund minus their handling fees if I can find out how to contact them. The booking should never have been made by them and their practice is deceitful. They state the booking was accepted, when the ""host"" was not even taking bookings.",5,"George of Anchorage, AK"
1747,"My mother signed up for Airbnb with a referral code I sent her. She accidentally entered her email as Gmail when it was another e-mail provider. They then changed the account appropriately but every time we tried to log in with her correct email/which they also had as correct on file it told her to please login with her “wrong email account.” The wrong email wouldn’t work either. There was no way to actually log into her account. We spent 2 hours on the phone Saturday, they route your call to Pakistan where the staff giggles at you under their breath and passively makes it harder to solve the problem (for which at heart they don’t want to fix and they find it funny because they hate westerners) and they just banter off the script and say I’m sorry Mr so and so over and over and I understand your frustration over and over.",5,"Joseph of Long Beach, CA"

We looked at the results returned by the search criteria and located one we liked. We took a look at the property photos and description details and that's what convinced us to choose the property as well as the description stating how close it was to the falls. We knew the property had a strict cancelation policy and thought that wouldn't be an issue since we were not planning to change anything about our planned trip.",5,"Emad-ud-deen of Westford, MA"
1750,"My husband and I just recently rented a unit on South Beach Florida. We had some real concerns about our accommodations when we arrived. Definitely not up to par for the money we were paying. After contacting the host, with no response, I called Airbnb customer service. I was lucky enough to have Macie answer the phone. Macie became my case manager and what a great one she is! She contacted the host on our behalf and within thirty minutes there was a call from the host. I will say the Host was quite responsive on fixing some of our concerns. However, in order to correct the problems, we had many people in our pad fixing the problems. ",5,"Vicki of Glen Allen, VA"
1751,"I've used Airbnb at least 15 times but NEVER AGAIN. I've never been to New Orleans before and was so excited. Six of my girlfriends and I planned a fun weekend getaway.

1752,I am a business professional. I have recently had the most horrible experience with an organization that calls themselves Airbnb. Their customer service representatives are rude and they tell the customers not to be rude to them. In that they will hang up on them if they even raise their voice. They have absolutely no respect for their customers none whatsoever. They cancel reservations on their own not their host but on their own and keep your money for up to three or four weeks before it is refunded. This company actions are criminal. In this organization needs to be investigated by the US government. This is the worst company I have ever dealt with in my life. I have never been so offended by an organization ever in my entire life and I hope that the owners of this organization pray to the good Lord for their souls for their criminal actions against their own customers.,5,"Douglas of Clermont, FL"
1753,My husband and myself just had a horrible experience renting a place in Montreal Quebec through AirBNB. The pictures were lovely and the Host was a SuperHost meaning he had great reviews and verified by AirBNB. We found out from a person that works at an AirBNB office that someone could not have all those reviews since 2015. This was a scam artist that hacked into the system and is continuing to hack in as AirBNB keeps sending him or whoever money. We called the Host from the airport as arranged (as I had sent him arrival time previously through AirBNB) with the number AirBNB gave us and it went into some strange language. I tried texting the host who went by the name of Stephane but no response. ,5,"Carol of Shuniah, ON"
1754,"I booked and paid for a month stay in Colombia through Airbnb. The host contacted me 22 days before arriving and literally blackmailed me; if I did not paid her an extra $450 dollars, she would cancel my stay and leave me without a place to stay. I DID NOT paid her ransom and I asked AirB&B to cancel my reservation and return my funds so I could make new arrangements. They said they CANNOT cancel the reservation until the fraudulent host do it themselves, YES. ",5,"Santiago of Calgary, AB"
1755,"Had a horrible experience during our stay in Barcelona. We were victims of extortion and slander by our host who, out of nowhere, decided to accuse us of stealing from him and demanded compensation. We were completely shocked by his claims and reported him to Airbnb immediately. They were absolutely useless in mediating, especially given the seriousness of the situation. They even allowed him to give us a negative review. Needless to say, we will not be using Airbnb ever again! Once they have your money, they could care less about what happens.",5,"Hector of Minneapolis, MN"
1756,"So we’re from Canada and made Airbnb booking in Mission, BC. Contacted the host, she gave me a link where I can continue with my booking, paid for everything, our stay with them was great, very accommodating and nice people. But, the night before we’re going to check out I found out that we’re charged almost $1k for 8 nights. From the receipt that Airbnb sent me, it was only $600++, as I was speaking to their customer service agent they couldn’t figure out why I was charged $732 plus a pending transaction of $181. ",5,"Judy of Calgary, AB"
1757,"We had a 4 hour delay checking in because the host never answered, and the management took over four hours. Pressed for a review, I was honest, not mean or unreasonable. They never published my review, so I am unable to trust their reviews. Nothing is all positive.",5,"Ela of Enterprise, AL"
1758,"Recently I have had a very unexpected and disappointing experience using Airbnb. I made a booking to stay at a Airbnb in Seville, Spain, but my host cancelled the booking less than a week before our arrival. I did not receive any warning and only found out after logging in to check my Airbnb account. From their troubleshooting web page I was told I was to receive a credit voucher for my inconvenience but I never received any message or email as told on their website. When I went to book a new accommodation, all the prices had on average doubled in price compared to my original booking. But when I went to the check out page when making a new booking, I was happy to see they automatically deducted a credit voucher and charged the difference. But later when I went to check my credit card statement, I was shocked to see they had made another charge without my knowledge. ",5,"Minli of Auckland, Other"
1759,"We showed up at dusk to the address. The host did not specify that there was an apartment A and B at the same address. And most of the pictures of the unit were of the outside of the upstairs apartment. We went to the upstairs unit, which was the only one you could see at that time of day. When we tried the door a dog barked at us. I thought we might have the wrong address and had the Uber driver take us what ended up being around the block, where we ended up at the same address. I finally noticed there was a downstairs. It was really dark down there (Sam does not leave the light on for you).

I had a Jeep full of belongings, and the guy who took my money for the week suddenly refunded it before my arrival and took his home off the Airbnb market. The next time, a week after starting my job, the reservation was cancelled again with no notice. I called and spent 30 minutes on the phone with the company only to be told that my account was ""under investigation for privacy"" and that my reservation was ""pending"" even though it had been confirmed (and now showed cancelled). The rep had an accent that made much of what he said unintelligible and when I asked for a supervisor, I got more minutes of hold with no one ever coming to the phone. ",5,"James of Portage, WI"

This came in handy for my next vacation, back to Colorado in April 2018 exactly one year later. I book a house for myself and 3 other guests (all of whom were also verified) in the middle of January 2018. I booked early in order to have a nice place to stay.

Two more bookings were made, I clearly told the guest, I can not check you in coz Airbnb is not paying me for my services. Once again that waived fee was grabbed.

We called and called and waited and then eventually decided to leave and try to find a place to stay. Airbnb would not refund me for this, and when I disputed it with Bank of America, they refused the refund. I did not stay at the rental and did my part in showing up.

When we drill down, several items are listed but infrequently, the government ID verification is not there. As a result, I have contacted the guest and Airbnb to find out what the story is. Almost without fail, Airbnb insists they are verified although I can find no proof thereof.",5,"Russ of Tucson, AZ"
1779,"Airbnb offers absolutely no protection for the customers in case the homeowner decides to cancel the booking. Even if you have reserved your place and paid all the money, there's no guarantee whatsoever that the owner will keep it for you, up till the very day of your stay. In my case, the homeowner of a NYC apartment deliberately canceled my booking 2 weeks before my $1400 worth stay, so I had to urgently seek a hotel in the vicinity - which turned out to cost me $700 more. On their end, Airbnb couldn't do much, and after a painstaking phone call with their customer representative, the best they could do was to offer me a paltry $15 discount on my ""NEXT"" stay. NEXT STAY?! Well, they are bold enough to think I will ever go back to their website again after that shameful incident.",5,"Olga of Costa Mesa, CA"

1782,"In what other business, are you allowed to charge half the fee within SECONDS of a person hitting the ""request"" button... and it's non-refundable. I believe that is a direct violation of New York State's ""Buyers' Remorse"" laws and I intent to file complaints with everyone I can. Airbnb is nothing more than a free-for-all platform that doesn't protect the consumers who use it.",5,"Frances of New York, NY"
1783,"We have used Airbnb for a couple of trips and have had a great experience. Both hosts commented about how quiet we were and how clean we left everything. So we were shocked to receive a refund for the property with no explanation as to why the reservation had been canceled. In December or January, I booked a townhouse in La Jolla for June, as we will be attending a wedding in the area. Now, with the wedding soon approaching, we have to scramble to find accommodations. Airbnb should have the courtesy to tell us why our reservation is canceled. I will not be booking with them, again, any time soon. There are plenty of companies that stand by the reservations they provide.",5,"Marla of Walnut Creek, CA"
1784,"Jason ** & Ping ** are hosts of FIVE downtown Montreal, Canada condos listed on Airbnb. They are dishonest crooks! We stayed one night in one of their condos. After our check-out, they made false accusations to Airbnb that we had smoked pot and damaged their condo, and claimed $400 to cover costs they claimed they incurred to ‘sanitize’ the air of the condo. When we demanded to see the air sanitizing company’s invoice, it was clearly revealed they had ‘photoshopped’ a FAKE invoice to reflect their lie!",5,"M. R. of New York, NY"
1785,"Our family including 4 year olds was kicked out of our 2 week rental for being “too messy” in the middle of the night on our second week. We lost our home recently in wildfires and came here to give our friends we stay with some alone time away from us. We got refunded our remaining days. However, a week later the hostess in Santa Rosa, named Mara is requesting from us $360 in damages we did not do claiming her things were brand new and we did a bunch of damage, left a large mess, and stole things.",5,"Greg of Santa Rosa, CA"
1786,"Customer service extremely unhelpful. I made a reservation and chose the option to pay 50% now, 50% later. I paid for the initial 50% with my credit card. I received a gift card after I made the reservation and contacted customer service to see if I could apply the gift card toward the remaining balance. They put me on hold for 5-7 minutes and came back saying I could not, I had to pay the rest with credit card. I said that was ridiculous and unacceptable, let me speak with someone that could help me. They said no one could help me. ",5,"Noah of San Diego, CA"
1787,"My experience similar to others below. Booked a room, but when checked in, place was filthy, it looked like someone else was living there unregistered, and generally had a really creepy feel. Couldn't stay there, but when attempting to get refund from Airbnb, they will always defer to the host. Because I didn't have enough documentation, they wouldn't give me a total refund. I actually had pictures of the dirty bathroom clearly showing dirty linens, but they claimed they couldn't see anything. So you take a big risk - if your host is a good one, you're lucky. If they're not and misrepresent their place, you're on your own - the host can just lie to Airbnb and they'll defer to them - they are host-friendly, not renter friendly. Not for lone travelers concerned about safety - residence mentioned above (""Parsa"", in Northridge, CA) would have been unsafe, because host never showed up with a key, and there were unregistered guests.",5,"Chad of Clovis, CA"
1788,"Booked the entire first week at a cottage in Sarasota, Florida. Place was filthy but since it was Easter weekend AND spring break there was nowhere else to go. Host refuses to acknowledge her place was filthy and publicly called us nitpicky as well as flat-out lied to Airbnb about us. Airbnb has completely ignored our complaints to them even when we pointed out that the host received 2 more 5 star reviews from other people during the same time we were at the property! Since we had the whole property to ourselves, I am curious where these other guests were staying. It's a scam and I will never use Airbnb again and I will tell everyone who will listen about our experience. The name of the cottage is ""Bayou Get-Away Cabin"" in Sarasota, Florida.",5,"Kelly of Welland, ON"
1789,"This is for all the folks that has ever thought about using Airbnb.com. I just left a place that was too nasty to stay in. Because I didn't cancel before check in, I only got a sixth of what I paid refunded. Because I canceled I can't leave a review. Keep that in mind when you see awesome reviews. Perhaps current photos of the bathroom would be wise to ask for in advance. As a disclaimer, my first two experiences were great, the last two has been so awful. I will never use this again.",5,"jeni of Plain City , UT"
1790,"DON'T USE Airbnb! I requested to book a 3-bed apartment that by the description and pictures on Air BnB looked wonderful. The host asked me to confirm the ages of the people traveling with me before he confirmed the booking. I did just as he asked. He then confirmed the booking, charging my credit card. 5 minutes later he messages me and tells me I will have to share 2 beds and the place is under renovation, unsafe for teenagers. I told him immediately that would not work. Then he tried to backtrack and say it's not really under construction but the rooftop was unsecured and not safe for teenagers. He knew I was traveling with teenagers as he had asked me twice. I told him I booked the place for the view and the fact it had 3 beds. He told me too bad if I cancel. It's my choice and there is no cancelation so I still pay. I canceled immediately. ",5,"Melanie of Lehi, UT"
1791,"For the first time I wanted to book an apartment with Airbnb in San Diego downtown but ended with a bad experience. The apartment is given in my search results when I searched for the listings with 2 adults plus 2 children. Airbnb showed this apartment as 'Rare found' and also showed a beautiful view of the downtown as if it is from the apartment. When we actually checked in the apartment, it is not at all child-friendly apartment, no child lock, our 2 year old can easily open the main door and go out, also scary patio from where you can see the down floors from the rails which got the big spaces. There is no view at all from the apartment.",5,"Srinivas of Newark, CA"
1792,"Upon gaining access to the rental site we discovered a leaking kitchen ceiling, dangling light fixtures in kitchen and bathroom and no working lights in any living areas. Within a half hour we notified the host that the premises were unsafe and unacceptable and we were canceling. We had to go to a hotel for the 7day trip; this cost a great deal more. Within 12 hours we notified Airbnb of the situation and they assigned a customer support ""agent"" to work on the case. We indicated we were not going to cancel on the Airbnb website because, per their policy statement, doing so within 24 hours of our rental would result in forfeiture of all fees. He assured us ""we were doing the right thing"". A day later Airbnb said they would only refund half the rental/cleaning fees with the other half going to the host! It was obvious that Airbnb kept their service fees and tried to serve two masters, satisfying none!",5,"Nicholas of Woolwich, ME"
1793,"After the host of our reservation, I tried to work with a case manager to find a new host, but had a nightmare. Case managers as well as supervisors didn’t call me back for days, on multiple occasions. We ended up having to get a hotel and I was told by a case manager she could reimburse me up to $200 to help cover the difference in the cost of the hotel and my reservation. A supervisor then reneged on that and wouldn’t give me a dime. The supervisor also took several days off while we were trying to resolve this, without notifying me, which would be fine except Airbnb wouldn’t let another case manager or supervisor help. Be prepared to work around their schedules rather than them working around ours. Or just don’t do business with them, I never will again.",5,"Wade of South Bend, IN"
1794,"My friends and I booked an apartment with Airbnb about 2 months in advance. When we arrived, it was a scam. The apartment had been rented out to another group. Airbnb support did nothing to help us and did not take our situation seriously. They stranded 3 young females in a foreign city and have refused to refund the $173 we spend on the rental. DO NOT USE this company!",5,"Diana of Littleton, CO"
1795,"My wife, two year old daughter and I stayed in Miami last year using one of Airbnb's listings. Upon arriving, the unit had an over flooded bathroom and disgusting sheets. The property manager kept moving us from one unit to the other to accommodate his other guests, and when we complained he threatened us - taking advantage of our situation with a child - and told us any complaints will make us end up on the streets. Airbnb made us leave the location for our safety, and the matter was considered resolved when we were offered a coupon to use and in return we would not file an official complaint with authorities. We now want to use this coupon (which is under my wife's name), but my wife is unable to travel. Airbnb refused to have me use the coupon which expires in 1 month, thus rendering the situation unresolved. We wasted our vacation and money, and it seems like legal action should have been the right solution.",5,"Ashraf of Winchester, MA"
1796,"As a host I have brought many concerns to the staff of Airbnb over the years only to be contradicted or told that ""nothing can be done"" about my issues. The latest of them concerned a very satisfied couple who had stayed with us for 3 nights prior to leaving on a cruise. When they returned, they were very disappointed to learn that their 5 star review was not accepted because it exceed the Airbnb's timeframe for reviews of 14 days from the close of their stay. THEY WERE ON A CRUISE! They were having fun and they figured they'd wait till they were back in the comfort of their own home to compose a nice review. No such luck...another one of Airbnb's ridiculous policies (of which there are many more).",5,"Caesar of Wilton Manors, FL"
1797,"Two days before my travel date, Airbnb canceled my reservation because of a past offense in the background check. I’ve been renting from different hosts for a year, given and received positive reviews, never had complaints from hosts, and never had issues with them. Even though I got a refund, I still have to scramble to find a place to stay at the last minute. I did not attempt to contact Airbnb because I’ve read that they give no help or response to people whose accounts they deactivated or banned. Airbnb say they don’t discriminate, but they judge people by their past. An offense 10 years ago will get you banned. It’s only a matter of time.",5,"Terence of San Antonio, TX"
1798,"I have been cancelled by Airbnb twice as an active guest in less than 30 days. I booked one In San Francisco then another to Jenner beach For the remainder of my stay in Cali to visit my sick mother. Less than 1 week of my travel dates I get an email cancelling my Jenner Beach reservation that has been charged to my account/cc already. Instead of telling the truth that someone made a mistake of posting such the wrong price instead they tried to claim that the host was contacting me outside the website. Which is a lie, because the host never responded to me but manage to approve only the reservation with no words of hey or how. “Deep breath house” hosted by Jacqui. ",5,"LAILANI of Concord , GA"
1799,"Booked a vacation on my debit card, instead of my credit card which overdrew my account. I got the notification within 2 seconds of clicking confirm on Airbnb and called them immediately (waited on hold for 15 minutes before talking to someone). I asked if they could stop the transaction and if I could just give a new credit card number. They said no, they could not. I asked if they could cancel the booking and just rebook over the phone with a different credit card, they told me I had to cancel online and rebook but pay all the cancellation fees. What a ** joke! So I had to spend an hour out of my workday to drive up to my boyfriend's work, get his card, withdraw money from his account, go to my bank, make the deposit to cover the overdraft. Such a hassle!",5,"Ashley of Encinitas, CA"
1800,"They keep your money if you cancel a transaction. Instead of sending your money back to the credit card, they keep it as a COUPON. If you don't check and don't ask, the ""coupon"" aka your money expires after 1 year and you lose it!!! Also, if you see a room but are not sure and don't book it, when you get back, the price is much higher. The taxes they charge the host and the guest are not clear. I spoke to hosts who told me they were charged much more. WE NEED SOME AGENCY TO INVESTIGATE AIRBNB.",5,"Roberto of Bronx, Other"
1801,This past week I had a tenant stop their monthly payment to Airbnb and skip out in the middle of the night. This violates my cancellation policy. Airbnb told me they would take care of the money and that particular Airbnb staff member never documented anything. The second Airbnb staff member said after three attempts to collect they would send the case to collections. That was several days ago and of course Airbnb has no phone number that they can give me to talk to the collections department. I am receiving no support or assistance in spite of their claims that they do so. Homeowner beware. If the tenant skips out it does not appear that Airbnb provides any assistance with collecting the rent.,5,"Marie of La Mesa, CA"
1802,"I purchased a week April 6-9 and then a month June 6- July 6 of rooms for my wife and I's honeymoon (out of country). That was a little over two months ago. I woke up this morning to an email saying that every one of my rooms had been refunded. I leave tomorrow so I did the natural thing and panicked. I tried to log into my account but could not. I then received an email stating that not only was my account deleted but that I'm also screwed out of all my reservations. Turns out that, my probation that I had completed on deferred judification made it where, I did meet their requirements to stay with any of the lodgings.",5,"John of Liberty Hill, TX"
1803,I booked an apartment through Airbnb for an extended stay in Italy. The host could not meet for check-in because he stated he was going to be out of town. I had a friend that lived locally to pick up the keys for me. My stay was shortened due to credit card fraud. I left the key with the same person that picked them up since he was not available for checkout. The host called me at 2am demanding keys which I did not have. I was already out of the country but the host wanted me to call his relatives to make arrangements. A few hours after that call I received a bill for over $500.00 to have a lock replaced.,5,"Suzanna of Las Vegas, NV"
1804,"We stayed in ""Ueno Sharehouse for Backpackers"" last March 21, 2018. We checked out at 10 am the next day. At around 2:30 pm, host is accusing us of breaking the cup/glass in which we even did not use as we have our own bottled water. Host is asking us to pay additional JPY 800. We appealed to Airbnb and the only thing they said is: ""We feel this is fair as your host reported the damage before the next guest checked in"". Clearly, they just take the side of the host. They did not review the guests' appeal carefully. What if the host is just doing that for its random guests just to take extra money.",5,"Joanne of Santa Rosa, Other"
1805,"I have stayed at various Airbnb places over several years, and while most all of them have been ok or some very nice, others simply do not live up to what is advertised and end up being ""disasters"". And when there have been OBVIOUS issues with customer service and the places...i.e. filthy carpets, bathroom and zero amenities as you would expect from a bnb...oh wait, even the name is Airbnb, I am told that many places are just rooms in homes for rent with many other permanent renters already living there. Not really bnb's. Well, that is false advertising. ",5,"Fabian of Grants Pass, OR"
1806,I was headed to Columbia for a bachelor party. Booked the wrong place due to location and also a friend that visited the location and informed me the looks were nothing like the pictures. Also was in a unlicensed building. So I called claims and tried to cancel. Airbnb informed it was the host decision and of course the host declined due to very little bookings. The full payment was 9k. They took 50 percent. I cancelled 30 minutes after booking. Their claims manager took days to respond and took the side of the host. I live check to check and they wouldn’t even accommodate a common mistake. Their concern is for their hosts not their guests because that’s their money maker. They by far have the worst customer service information. I will be reporting them to the Better Business Bureau and recommend that no one use this company. Please spread the word.,5,"Nathanil of Cerritos, CA"
1807,"I booked an apartment on Airbnb 3 months ago. Apartment was shown available on Airbnb. Just after booking and paying I got information from host, that it was a mistake and apartment was overbooked. Airbnb didn't help to refund my money. Above all they refused to refund service fee, even though they wrongly offered an already booked room. Fortunately I had a honest host who refunded me completely. Comment of Airbnb: ""It's illegal!!"" NEVER AGAIN. I deleted my account. Can't recommend Airbnb.",5,"Thomas of Wallisellen, Other"
1808,"I feel that the main problem with Airbnb is that it allows a lot of bad hosts to get business that they would otherwise not get if not for the visibility that the Internet provide them. Many bad hosts are just very good at manipulating their image and reviews on the Internet so that they can take advantage of guests to make a quick profit. I am referring to the hosts which most guests would not decide to choose if they had been able to see the place in person, that is, in those cases where there are pretty obvious gaps between perception and reality. I also had hosts giving me false names, contact information, or pretending to be medical doctors or something else about them difficult to verify and I was surprised to find out that there is no Airbnb policy to discourage that. On the other hand though, Airbnb policies are tough on guests. Not fair. Airbnb policies are too biased in favor of hosts in my opinion.",5,"Steve of Toronto, ON"
1809,"When I booked my accommodation with Airbnb I saw the big print ""Free Cancellation"" (up to a week before arrival). Unfortunately, I didn't read the fine print that the cancellation does not apply to the service fee. Very disappointing that no watchdog is reviewing this type of deceptive practice. What would it take to have small print directly near the words Free Cancellation? Unfortunately, Airbnb has several ways to hide information that they don't want others to see.",5,"Klaus of Vancouver, BC"
1810,"Airbnb Hawaii. A ""charming cottage"" from hell at AirBnB. We sweated it (never used Airbnb before and won’t again) it as the owner would not release the address until the day before. As a group of three (one being my 18 year old son) we came to Oahu on business in Sept 2016 for 18 days. We felt getting a group lodging might be less expensive compared to getting 2-3 hotel rooms in Waikiki.",5,"Al of Murrieta, CA"
1811,"This is the original email I sent to Airbnb after I called them and they asked me to type up my complaint. ""I will send pics to follow after this email. I wanted to first describe the experience with Joseph in Siesta Key. This was a two day reservation totaling $3650. It was a completely overrated stay. This is a 1.8 million dollar house that should have been in pristine condition. There were many red flags upon arriving. But upon arrival we overlooked some looking forward to a weekend for my best friend of 20 yrs getaway before she gets married. So rather than a bridal shower we decided to find a place to stay where we could all gather and hang out without going anywhere. This house was definitely not what we expected. There were Cheerios on the floor by the front door. Fingerprints on all the siding glass doors. It was clear the countertops of the kitchen were not wiped down before our stay dispute the $250 cleaning fee that is required.",5,"Angelica of Lutz, FL"
1812,My business partner booked 2 different accommodations for a week long trip in London. Both locations were rated as 5 stars and both were unacceptable-less than 1 star. I could not stay at either for fear of bedbugs or worse. As a woman I feared for my safety in both locations. Both reservations were cancelled upon arrival and yet we charged full price for both locations. Airbnb's response to resolve the issue was equally unacceptable. We were forced to pay for the full 5 nights even though we cancelled and did not stay in either then we had to find last minute hotels at 350CDN a night. The stress was unbelievable. I will never recommend Airbnb to anyone. Hotels have spent years gaining their stars whereas any Joe can operate a bug infested rooming house. Call it a house with a private room for rent and have who knows who to write up phoney reviews for them. BUYER BEWARE. Airbnb is a scam.,5,"Barbara of Beaumont, AB"
1813,Airbnb will take your money when it should be refunded. I was not informed where the keys were located to enter my reservation so I cancelled with the host before I arrived due to not feeling safe to travel there without an understanding of how to securely lock the unit. I did not stay there for reason of safety and the lame customer service and host decided to keep my money and ignore the good faith effort to cancel before I arrived and my concerns for safety. Do not trust Airbnb... They will steal your money and they have hosts who ignore obvious reason to refund money.,5,"Brenda of Ross, CA"
1814,"I was a host on Airbnb with 7 apartments in the busiest location in the world for 2016- Osaka, Japan. Over the course of 3 years, I gradually scaled down the operation to just 1 and transferred to different website. Just now, I removed my last apartment from Airbnb and I cannot describe how relieved do I feel now, when I don't need to deal with these ** anymore. At first, they had great customer service and call centers. Then the sudden expanding of the company caught them unprepared for the size of their operation and the problems they haven't thought could appear. All in all, partnering with them cost me a lot of money, loss of business partners and respect from local community. They would randomly take side with clients, trying to cancel reservations with BS excuses, so they will not have to pay cancellation fee.",5,"Ivaylo of Varna, Other"
1815,"So I recently put I a report for Airbnb, happily they are going to refund me. I still do not plan on using them in the future... This is a copy of their reply. I hope this is helpful to others... If you. have a problem with a refund dont give up.",5,"Shanie of Hernando Beach, FL"
1816,"Airbnb refused to refund what I paid for renting a condo unit that was not suitable for rent or even for staying in it for one free night. We paid near 150 USD for three nights and I got refunded only 40 USD. I had both legal and ethical reasons to cancel upon checking in and viewing the place: The only aircon in the large condo was not working properly. The host representative who checked us in advised us to just restart the aircon every time it ""dies"" and it did stop within 10 minutes after we checked in. The host expected us to get up throughout the night to restart the aircon when it ""dies"". The host later denied what her rep told us and claimed that the aircon was working fine, although two people witnessed what the rep said. ",5,"Samuel of Sanford, NC"
1817,"The house was supposed to sleep 8 and only slept 6, it was supposed to be 15 min from French Quarter, it was 30 and sometimes more depending on traffic. The refrigerator did not work so all our food ruined and the owner never sent anyone out. The garbage disposal was also broken. We had to buy a air mattress and ice chest which was an extra expense and time from our vacation. Then a code enforcement officer shows up and says that this Home is being rented out illegally! I will never use Airbnb again!",5,"April of Fort Worth, TX"
1818,"I had a reservation at this room from 3/9- 3/12. We could only stay one night because the conditions were so deplorable. We were promised a rollaway bed and air mattress because there were 3 men staying. When we checked in neither was there upon check in, they finally dropped off air mattress with no blankets or pillows, then it didnt fit on the floor flat as room was too small, bathroom was full of mold, tiles caved in and falling off walls. These are not safe or healthy living conditions. They refused to refund me for the night we could not stay, they also refused to refund me for a future stay 6 months from now!! Do not use this company!",5,"Charles of Orlando, FL"
1819,"On the 11th of March, I booked an apartment in Poland. The response of the host was that the price was higher for the period (Christmas) that I booked. I filed a complaint at Airbnb stating that the EU Directive for Consumer Rights does not allow traders to change prices. It states: ""Traders are obliged to display correct and complete pricing information before a customer makes a purchase online"". Additionally, Article 7.12. of the terms and conditions of Airbnb for hosts states: ""You are solely responsible for setting a price (including any Taxes if applicable) for your Listing (“Listing Fee”). Once a guest requests a booking of your listing, you may not request that the guest pays a higher price than in the booking request.""",5,"Ralph of Nieuwegein, Other"
1820,"I don't know if Airbnb recently outsourced their call center or what but their service has gone way downhill. As a host that has two properties on Airbnb and VRBO I used to think Airbnb was much easier to do business with but that is not the case anymore. They changed my cancellation policy without notice, they've refunded my guests without consulting me, and after 5 years and hundreds of thousands of $ in bookings, they recently notified me that I am at risk of having my account suspended for ""only"" having a 4.7 Star rating while 81% of 170 reviews are 5 Star reviews. Besides the fact that math does not work, I'm not sure it's possible to get much better rating than 4.7 and I don't appreciate being their aggressive and condescending threats. They are so tone deaf and their customer service sucks. Better to use VRBO as host or traveler.",5,"John of Santa Cruz, CA"
1821,"Mark, my ""host"" in London, was exceptionally aggressive when we were a few minutes late checking out, and has now left patiently false feedback regarding our stay that I am afraid will prejudice future hosts. He has stated that we were asked to leave by security because we were aggressive, which is an outright fabrication, as (1) we never saw security, and (2) it was Mark who was aggressive and basically threw us out of the apartment. We left without comment.",5,"Philip of Vienna, VA"
1822,When I first started using Airbnb I felt their services were excellent. In the last year I have noticed a complete change of customer service toward hosts. Last night trying to resolve a very simple problem of a guest requesting staying another night and trying to pay - it took 3 hours and at least 5 people to talk to. I was actually yelled at by one rep and told I should not charge them at all! Excuse me - why the heck not! I had some guests who were just filthy and had the house smelling like a garbage can.,5,"Donna of San Jose, CA"
1823,My family and I rented a condo through Airbnb which got broken into. The owner did nothing about it or the items that we had lost so we wrote a review on his page. He flagged it and it got removed. We followed the company’s review policy and did not violate it. I have lost confidence in Airbnb if they will not allow the negative posts along with the positive ones. How will future guests ever know that their safety or personal property can be compromised at this location? Very poor judgment by Airbnb!,5,"Audrey of Decatur, IL"
1824,"Airbnb condo in Cancun - Macarena Residence - Condominium Na-Ha. We rented this condo for a week. On the third day, we came back from an all-day fishing trip and several of our electronic and personal items had been stolen from the condo, approx $1800. Property owner strongly discouraged us from calling the police, advising that he would check it out. He did absolutely nothing. Airbnb would not accept our review due to their policy that no negative feedback is allowed. We will not recommend Airbnb because they do not allow honest reviews that reflect negatively on their property owners, even when it involves theft and personal safety.",5,"Carolyn of Bloomfield, NM"
1825,"I have always been a pleasant guest at any Airbnb I've stayed at, and have never had a single negative review. Airbnb froze my account and banned me on the grounds of a background check they ran. Because of a DUI I got 7 years ago, I am not allowed to use Airbnb. Indefinitely.",5,"Sara of Wheeling, IL"
1826,"The customer service is now past terrible. Airbnb is making adjustments on payments on their own, holding payments and doing it in a sinister manner where host and co-host are each unaware of each other's transaction which makes it easy for the payments disappear. Airbnb didn't honor a simple cancellation policy more than just once. Today I find out that I have a guest coming in few days, but I'm gonna end up owing Airbnb 250$+ after all transaction, because they claim I may owe them some money from March 2017??? If you are one of those owners that need to know when and how you are getting paid, this is gonna be nerve racking altogether.",5,"Mike of Lancaster, CA"
1827,Airbnb has denied to pay any money to me against the guest insurance claim. The house where I stayed burned to the ground which was caused by overheated wiring in the walls due to improper installation. I have been chasing Airbnb customer care for past 2 months and finally they have sent an email saying that they do not pay insurance for these type of incidents. If not for FIRE incident then I am curious for what type of incidents they pay the insurance and why they charge money for insurance. This incident could have been avoided if proper inspection was done by Airbnb. The American guests who stayed at the same house got the insurance money from Airbnb 3 weeks ago without any pain. This is a complete torture and racial discrimination by Airbnb. Please advise what I can do in this country as an immigrant to claim for my loss. I can share more proofs on request.,5,"Priya of Seattle, WA"
1828,"Even if this is very convenient and looks like a great idea at the beginning, it becomes increasingly frustrating to USE Airbnb... and I say USE for a good reason, because there is NO consumer respect from this organisation, it feels like you are dealing with a machine.

Upon arrival, we discovered that 2 bedrooms in this cottage were locked. We contacted our host, Tommy **, and asked him to unlock the bedrooms. He explained that we need to pay more money to him directly if we want to unlock the rooms and also additional money as a fee for opening bedrooms. We contacted Airbnb support team with no results.

1830,"My wife and I booked a house from Airbnb and everything went well for the first experience. But as soon as we tried to book a second time, the credit card was rejected - which I immediately resolved by the bank - triggering the set of events proving Airbnb is a loss of time and energy run by extremely unprofessional employees. The earliest response you may expect from support is at least 8 hours - if you are lucky and have enough time to talk to a case manager.",5,"Emre of Toronto, ON"
1831,DO NOT BOOK WITH AIRBNB. We booked a reservation with a host SEVEN months in advance. We went to confirm our stay with the host a week before leaving and they said they were not going to honor our reservation. Apparently they were not allowed to offer Airbnb in the residence anymore. They failed to tell us that. So we call Airbnb and request a refund and compensation to pay for a hotel (as we are 4 days from the trip - spring break in Cancun) they offer TEN PERCENT of the original stay. Trying to find a place to stay in this location and time is IMPOSSIBLE AND EXPENSIVE. I guess their customer service thinks that an extra $40 is enough to pay for a last minute reservation. THEN the refund was supposed to take 5-10 days when we leave in 4... Only after talking to 4 customer service reps and a manager was I able to get an extra $100 (which I'm not even sure I will be getting). ,5,"Cassie of Duluth, MN"
1832,"We booked a stay of just under one month at Martin’s “Trendy family apt with parking next to city center” last October. We were due to travel to Prague to the Czech language college which, once we have accommodation sorted, we booked and paid for. This was followed by ferries, hotels en route, etc.  A week before our departure date, Martin sent me an email stating that the apartment was no longer available, but due to him being a ‘Superhost’, he needed me to cancel it because otherwise he’d lose this status. No concern was shown for the fact that suddenly, myself, my partner, our two dogs and our car had nowhere to go at the end!",5,"Dale of Alford, Other"
1833,"I first used the service without a problem, but the second time was a complete nightmare. All of the sudden I needed to take a picture of my ID and match against a current picture that I take of myself. 20 hours later I am still trying to accomplish the feat. Either my ID picture is too blurry or I do not match my picture ID taken almost 4 years ago! I cannot pass this step and can no longer use this service. F----- rating. Do not waste your time on this website.",5,"Scott of North Las Vegas, NV"
1834,"I feel like a fool for giving them a copy of my driver's license. Next thing I know, they've already accessed my email contacts list & want access to my phone via the camera so I can take a ""selfie"" for verification! They now want a credit card number before they will delete my account! This is just creepy and not safe! DO NOT Trust Airbnb!",5,"MJ of Cloudland, GA"
1835,I FEEL ROBBED - Airbnb claims that a host should be worry free of damage done by a guest. WRONG! They will NOT Pay me for extreme damage that my guest has also admitted to me through messages that I showed them. They are telling me to resort through other options and wished me future luck with future guests. Their responses came on graveyard hours which is a scam because they only give a week to get estimates. I gave them an estimate from a reputable contractor that is licensed and sent them the messages from the guest and it still wasn’t enough for them. Scam company. Do not use them unless you are prepared to pay for any and all damages. This is the third time I’ve had damage and not one was paid. Enough is enough. I will no longer be hosting for a company that doesn’t take responsibility. Avoid from hosting!,5,"Rio of Carmichael, CA"
1836,"I worry about Airbnb insufficiently screening hosts. And I would not book an Airbnb by myself. But we've stayed in some very convenient locations, like Brooklyn near Prospect Park.",5,"Victoria of Austin, TX"
1837,When Airbnb changed their calendar format it cancelled all my blocked dates. I did not know about this until a guest made a booking on a blocked date. Of course I had to regret and apologize to the guest. Airbnb only arrogantly warned me that they would remove my listing if it happened again. I explained what had happened but no apology... US companies never apologize... must be their lawyers. Also I get guests that ask for contact information and I have to tell them that Airbnb does not allow it. Airbnb puts all the onus on the hosts. Their model is good but fading fast. I would love to have other business to work with.,5,"Al of Shemlan, Other"
1838,"Last year during the summer I rented an RV in Winter Haven in order to take the family to Legoland. We arrived at the RV and from outside it seemed nice next to a pond. We stepped inside the RV and the family got hit in the face with a poop stench. We couldn’t get ahold of the owner until a few hours later. Wife and kids couldn’t breathe because of the horrific ODOR emitting from the toilet which engulfed the entire RV. Finally, we jumped back into our car and drove to a nearby hotel.",5,"Miguel of Pompano Beach, FL"
1839,"The biggest crooks and the worst business ever. They removing reviews of bad guests with no reasons because they know bad reviews gonna demolish people accounts and they not gonna use Airbnb and go to hotels, because hosts wouldn't host them. It happened at least 3 times with me when Airbnb always could find something in my negative review to guest that violates their policy. The last case was literally catching off guard when the guy who stayed in our hostel made a drama on his last night staying when police almost came over because the girl he hang out with accused him in putting illegal substances in the drink and this screwed up idiot lost his wallet under the bed accusing people in stealing it. We saved that idiot from police almost coming for him because we talked to the girl and calmed her down. ",5,"Sergii of Miami Beach, FL"
1840,I would give it a zero if I could. The room at the Fontainebleau that was reserved 6 mos in advance and paid in full with receipt and reservation number was not cancelled by the owner the day of arrival. We flew across the country for Valentine's weekend and now I am now fighting to get my money back for a room that didn't exist.,5,"Gary of San Clemente, CA"
1841,"Found a great home on Whidbey Island ""Anchors away"" right on the beach. Will be there for a wedding later this summer. After inputting all my info, they then decide my ID is not a match with my picture. Hello. That's me. What can you do? They thought it was OK enough to take my $1000 payment for the rental! Then cancelled my reservation at 2 am the next morning, stating they couldn’t ID me! Never called, never gave me a chance to submit another picture.",5,"Colette of Stevensville, MT"
1842,"Rented home in Cape Coral, Florida thru Airbnb. The host was Michelle of MHB Property Management. The house **. When we arrived we couldn't get in. The host had to be called, the host didn't return the call. Another person we had not dealt with did, after we go in there were no directions to operate the pool or hot tub. Again we called the host but no one returned our call, the stove was leaking gas so bad the women were scared to use it (very dangerous situation). The maid service left a note apologizing for not completing the cleaning of the house which we paid $325.00 for the cleaning service. Contacted Airbnb and the host company and they blew us off because THEY WERE ALREADY PAID! Sad state of affairs!",5,"Terry of Gaylord, MI"
1843,We rented a house from Airbnb for 3 days. The description never said it was a trailer/modular home. First arrived and there was a garage right by the back patio. Man came out wearing a pair of jeans and no shirt. He was not the host. He worked most of the day. Customer service said that since I didn’t have a picture of the man it was out of their hands. Dining room light was missing 3 light bulbs and kitchen ceiling fluorescent light did not work. Call host and they brought us over light bulbs but kitchen light was never fixed. Pulled a baking pan out and it was full of rust. Stove burners did not work. There was food under the couch cushions. Description said House was walking distance to wineries. Not true. Contacted customer service when I got home to requests refund and sent them some of the pictures I took. ,5,"Monica of Lapalma, CA"
1844,"I booked a place for my husband to stay for a month. What transpired was horrible. The place was cluttered. The bed had missing planks and you fell through sometimes. Fridge was filthy. The worst part was the bathtub screen was broken, so to get in and out of the bathtub/shower you had to sit on a ledge and squish your feet around. My husband hurt his back getting out and he finally checked out. The air conditioner doesn't work in the room he booked and in Australian heat this is unacceptable.",5,"Anne of Docklands, Other"
1845,Last week I booked a place for my family to stay for a week through Airbnb. After a couple of hours I received my reservation confirmation. Within a few minutes I received a text from the owners stating that the amount was not right and that it would be several hundred more dollars per night if I wanted to stay there. I thought it was some kind of a scam! I had to leave my home for the evening within a few minutes of getting this text. I thought I would wait and see if anything more would come of it. When I got home I immediately went to bed. After I was asleep someone from Airbnb called me and woke me up. I heard them say something about an emergency. I said I was sleeping and they had woken me up. And I knew it was not an emergency!,5,"Garnet of Backus, MN"
1846,I was part of an adult and professional family who rented an expensive house through AIRBNB for four weeks so I speak from bitter and first hand experience. On both sides of the house we rented through AIRBNB there were major construction works being carried out. Let me be clear - these were not renovations or extensions or repairs - but brand new builds. THEY DID NOT COME ABOUT AFTER OUR BOOKING BUT WERE KNOWN TO THE HOST AT THE TIME OF BOOKING. They were major building sites - in what was described as a quiet residential area. At NO time whatsoever did the host point this issue out to us. The overriding comment I am making is this. Problems within a rented AIRBNB can crop up after the 24 hour period. They do not always happen within the first 24 hours.,5,"Joan of Hebden Bridge, Other"
1847,"I recently went on our first trip to Europe, just my 10 year old and myself. One stop was in Denmark for 3 days in December. The apartment we rented from Jaroslav and Lina ** had no heat and wasn't as described. Upon entering, there was an unusual smell, but we just figured that different countries cook different foods and not every place smells like home.",5,"Cristie of Leetsdale, PA"
1848,We have had 2 cancellations with Airbnb. Last one they had $2000 of our money for almost 5 months and cancelled with no interest or bonus at all. Of course no other places or I would have picked them initially. We booked VRBO for years and never had an issue.,5,"Darlene of Regina, SK"
1849,"My daughter and I both tried to take pictures of our government issued IDs and our faces, in order that we might make a reservation. We are not stupid. We have both graduated from high school which should be all one would need in order to fill out a reservation. In addition, we have between us two Bachelor of Art degrees, two Master degrees, and one Ph. D. But could we make a reservation? Why no, we couldn't. It seems neither of us was capable of taking pictures that were up to Airbnb's standards.",5,"Judy of Brooklyn, NY"
1850,"Very troublesome and deceitful - I booked an accommodation with AirBnB. They sent a confirmation number confirming complete and paid reservation. The next morning they canceled my reservation, saying I needed a new photo and government ID. They should not have confirmed and charged me if they didn't have all the information they required. This happened once before as well.",5,"Pamela of Rockport, MA"
1851,"I was a host on Airbnb and the guest completely ruined my home. I wrote a negative review of the guest but Airbnb removed it. Airbnb does not what negative reviews to impact your profit margin. That means you don't see negative reviews of guests, Which means you are unprotected. That means that guest will destroy someone else's home. Airbnb is unethical and hypocritical. They talk about community but it's a lie.",5,"Ann of Dundas, ON"
1852,"Recently, the Trust and Security Dept. took my account offline because some unknown source may have hacked it. I was promised the situation would be resolved in one day and it's been more than a week that my account has been offline. I am a SuperHost and have had this status since the company started the program. As a SuperHost, we have tasked with making 5-star reviews in Communication, Accuracy, and Value. Obviously, Airbnb cannot produce the same.",5,"Julie of Burlington, VT"
1853,"Airbnb refused to accept a complaint regarding 726 7th St., Astoria, OR, a property advertised on Airbnb that the inside temperature was only 5 degrees warmer than sleeping in a car/outdoors in the winter in Oregon. Other guest were visually observed in their beds because the house is freezing. Guests have to sleep in a jacket, a hood, mittens, sweaters, fleece clothing, numerous pair of socks. The female hostess throws insults at guests who request a refund.",5,"Carolyn of White City, OR"
1854,"My family and I wanted to visit Montreal for 3 days and decided to book a place through Airbnb, instead of paying for hotel. The booking process was easy and simple as usual, so no problem there. The day we were supposed to arrive, our host told us that there is a leak in his condo and is unable to host us. He was extremely nice and offered us a free stay at another condo, however we wanted something different so we declined the offer. We went on Airbnb AGAIN, because we thought we just had a bad luck and it was nobody's fault.",5,"Natalia of Ottawa, ON"
1855,I am a homeowner listing on Airbnb. Their customer service is horrible. My listing is corrupted so that I can't respond to requests for bookings. I have spent hours on hold with a series of reps who haven't helped. One rep refused to believe my story and I had to send her screenshots of the problems on the site. After spending 20 minutes on hold each time I got cut off twice. Supervisor was supposed to call me back. He never did. They redact emails and phone numbers so you and potential guest can't contact each other directly. So far I have lost 2 bookings. And don't know what to do next.,5,"Lorna of Brookline, MA"
1856,"Rented what was billed as a ""very nice condo on a golf course"". When I arrived it was actually a filthy trailer soaked in cigarette residue uninhabitable. The pictures used in the ad were not even the same property. The host persuades you to pay her directly on PayPal, then when you arrive offers a refund when you can't tolerate staying there. She never provides the refund & Airbnb won't help you because you've paid the host directly (at her urging of course). This is the listing, in Cathedral City CA: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4949043. Beware of this listing. Airbnb continues to provide listing for this fraud. In person she appears with her elderly mother & the 2 of them are extremely charming. The charm ends when you attempt the promised refund and the host begins hurling insults via text & email.",5,"George of Rio Nido, CA"
1857,"No rating as so poor... Arrived at a property at 3.30pm for 2 nights, left following morning at 11am. Property filthy in places especially kitchen- oven and fridge, bed at point of collapse, prescription drugs for owner in drawer in the kitchen accessible to anyone (we had children with us). Owner refusing 1 night's refund as we left without giving them notice or chance to rectify?! Would have taken them longer than the 2 nights we had booked to rectify! Airbnb NO help! In favor of owner! Absolutely disgusted with their total lack of care! Ripoff company! No wonder on Ripoff Britain this morning!",5,"Alison of Holme Hale. Norfolk, Other"
1858,"I had what I thought was a confirmed reservation for Ken's condo in Bangkok. And, about one month out, I received an email that Ken had ""canceled"". I could not believe it. Host are able to cancel. And, while Airbnb claims the host is penalized... The renter receives NONE of that penalty (it goes to Airbnb). So, you are simply left out in the cold to find another condo. Well, I suppose I could just ""search"" for a different condo. But, what happens when that host cancels? And, Airbnb claims to put notification on the host's page that he/she has canceled. One week later there is still no notification for other potential renters on Ken's page. Simply, BEWARE.",5,"Ben of Goddard, KS"
1859,"Guys be careful when you book on Airbnb next time. I made a booking No. **. I purchased air tickets and packed my bags for next days travel - only to hear that the host has cancelled my booking. And Airbnb does not take any responsibility to provide me alternative booking. Since it is the last minute - now they are demanding me to shell out 300% MORE so that I can get similar property. It is such a huge disappointment that I never expected from Airbnb. They charge you 20% booking fee, but when things don't go right, they just wash off their hands blaming the host. Come on, do we book with Airbnb because we know the host prior to booking?",5,"Ramesh of Taguig, Other"
1860,"SHAME ON AIRBNB. SHAME ON AIRBNB. I tried very hard to get help less than 24 hours after I had booked a room and wanted to change due to lack of trust of the host. Airbnb made no effort to make things right for me. You have NO advocate with Airbnb if things go bad... I had until now booked with them with a false sense of security that their customer service would handle things fairly if needed, however my experience with Maria at Airbnb was proof that they put ill educated and poorly trained people in charge of handling (if you call it that!) issues.",5,"Ma of Calabasas, CA"
1861,"I have been a host on Airbnb for over 3 years and submitted my first report because a guest booked with me for two nights and upon their departure it was discovered they set up a screen printing business in my home for the two days they stayed and damaged my sofa, linens, glass top of coffee table and bathtub. I followed Airbnb guidelines and contacted a representative at their Help number, which took all of my information and the specifics revolving around the incident and damages. The rep said she would email me a form that I needed to fill out to report such damages to my property. 24 hours later I called the Help number again because I had not received the form as promised and a new rep said there were no notes in their system of my incident report.

1862,"We rented a room through Airbnb at 4603 Skyline Boulevard Unit 6, Cape Coral, FL from November 9 - November 15, 2017. Nice condo, however, we were eaten alive by bed bugs. So we rated our trips with one and two stars with a note about its infestation of unwanted bed bugs. First response from Airbnb next day was: ""Reconsider your evaluation"". We did not do it- nothing to reconsider. Second day response from Airbnb: ""You are not in compliance with the rules therefore we cannot post your comments"". When we tried to response and include a photo of our bites we found out that we were blocked out from the system. Basically they want to hide any bad experience due to their future profits that are above all for them. So we cannot warn the future guests for this situation.",5,"Jerry of Chico, CA"
1863,"My wife does not understand English very well and when I stepped in to question an unethical by an Airbnb ""professional"" he immediately said I was not on the account and he terminated the phone call. Please be VERY VERY careful if you so choose this company. Airbnb's relationship with its property owner is contentious. If something goes wrong they will each say it's the customer's fault. Just a terrible representation of a business.",5,"Forrest of Bloomington, MN"
1864,Airbnb is getting extremely unreliable. A few months ago my husband booked a place in Paris. It was canceled. He rebooked a place again and that one was cancelled less than 2 weeks before he was leaving. A few months ago I thought I would give it a try again and booked a house in Barcelona for a very reasonable price. Dec 19th I get a notice that the booking was canceled. Another friend of mine told me something similar happened to her in Madrid.,5,"Rose of Nyc, NY"
1865,"My family and I booked an apartment in Catania, Sicily for two nights. After one night, we were forced to leave because the smell of natural gas and mildew permeated the apartment leaving us all feeling nauseous. We first addressed our concerns with the owner, who seemed to think we should just keep the main doors open (keep in mind, the doors faced a street with heavy traffic). We then addressed our concerns with Airbnb customer service and finally submitted a detailed review to notify other Airbnb users of our disturbing experience in hopes that the owner would rectify the situation for all future guests. This was one week ago. ",5,"Jayme of St Louis, MO"
1866,I made the following complaint to Airbnb about a fraudulent listing of a two bedroom apartment and they denied my complaint... there is no standard as to what someone can list a room as a bedroom: BEWARE!!! I have one simple question: What standard does AIRBNB use when allowing owners of properties to define a room as a BEDROOM? Is it the IBC (International Building Code) The ICC (International Construction Code) The IRC (International Residential Code)? OR Do you just take the owners word for it without any defined standard?,5,"Robert of Camarillo, CA"
1867,I want to love Airbnb. In 4 stays over 4 mos - average $100/night I found some very aggravating things hosts could easily fix. My suggestions: Check your cleaning service! 2 coffee pots were filthy - one impacted with moldy grounds - Clean often with white vinegar! 2 places had coffee pots - no filters. I'll bring coffee but the correct size filters provided by host would be nice. 1 had awesome espresso machine - that didnt work. Dust! Sneezed all night at a $100 guest house - in the AM I found the wall at the head of the bed was covered in dust! Under the bed same (Same place with moldy coffee pot).,5,"Susan of Gardnerville, NV"
1868,"Booked for first time - their site has location bubble (bubble is about 250 yards across) that shows right by LA Convention center for my daughter to stay at for a convention. Reviews had multiple Claims of ""LITERALLY RIGHT ACROSS FROM THE CONVENTION CENTER."" Asked Host before booking if access to Pool as pictured - she wrote back Yes with smiley face. I booked and ""Get Directions"" showed address as 1355 Flower Street just across from Convention Center. My daughter drive and the Property manager drove her to a unit 1.2 miles away from Convention Center in a bad neighborhood - On top of which pool is under construction and not accessible on top of Unit was Filthy dirty inside.",5,"Jon of San Rafael, CA"
1869,"I found a condo, my card was charged, and immediately I get a response from the owner saying my dates were unavailable. I had just reserved and paid. So, my card was charged. Why? I had to request a refund which can take up to 5 days to go back to my card. Luckily we have plenty of funds. However, what about people who can't afford to book another place without that money? This is a scam. Should not trust your card with these people. Hopefully the refund will show up and we don't have to go through a dispute process. I will not book with Airbnb again.",5,"Dusty of Joplin, MO"
1870,I booked an Airbnb home from host S.F. Maple in Jupiter Fl. After full payment they canceled our reservation a week prior to our stay with no explanation. I had to share my negative experience here because it's obvious that Airbnb filters negative feedback from its website. Beware!!!,5,"Roland of Valrico, FL"
1871,Every time I try to make a booking they show a higher price than what they advertise. What is happening here. This is not something that changes based on for example day of week or month but this is very consistent. Stop lying. I won't use you if that continues.,5,"Ben of Austin, TX"
1872,"Whoever want to use Airbnb must know that if issues occurred, they will not help you, they just a platform where you can see vacation properties. I have invite a place through them in Venice (Los Angeles), I have arrived to this place, and it was terrible and far from the description. I have left the place after about 2 hours (when not getting responses from the owner), and Airbnb refuse to do anything about it and even refuse to let me write a review on that place. They did not give me any money back (and even did not offer to give me some small discount in future reservation, just to be nice).",5,"Tal of R'Aanana, Other"
1873,"We were looking forward to a trip to the TN Smoky Mountains and thought renting a cabin would be a great way to ""get-away"" from the crowds. Well the picture of the cabin we chose was really cute and it looked so nice that I booked it for 3 days. When we got to the cabin it was NOT what it seemed on the Airbnb site and not what it was described as being. The cabin was only about 100 feet off a country road with 2 other cabins right in front of it. The people in the both of the front cabins looked like they owned their cabins and the front cabin had parking right up to the front of our cabin. There was no ""mountain views"" and the people in the front cabin made noise up to 10 pm. ",5,"KC of Cocoa, FL"
1874,I was having a major issue verifying my payment option which lead to a delay in my reservation. I had no other options and hadn't heard back from the host. I spoke with James ** who remained on the line while navigated the system and waited for a response from the host. He then offered to contact host in a attempt to make sure I booked the location time and price I wanted. James ** went over and beyond and was literally a guardian angel and prevented me from being on the streets that night. After speaking with him I was immediately verified and booked at my chosen destination. Thank you James ** for understanding the importance and urgency of my booking.,5,"S. t. of Long Beach, CA"
1875,"Horrible communications and very difficult to deal with. Just takes too much time and just can't get answers. Sometimes they answer quickly, but often takes a long time, and they have changed their email on me twice in the past three months. Will go elsewhere.",5,"Larry of St. Pete, FL"
1876,"We rented a Condo in Colorado for 3 nights. Katie is the host (probably the owner). We paid around $544 dollars and it was including some ""extra fees"" and a $100 cleaning fee. When we got there, it was a clean place, quiet, and nice. She had food (pretty much cans) and everything we needed. The only thing we used from her few food items was some pancake flour. THAT was it! According to the rules on the website there was NO charge for extra people, $100 cleaning fee, and check out time was Monday at 11:00 am. This woman sent me an email every day (which was extremely annoying) and on Sunday asked what time was I leaving so she could send her cleaning people. ",5,"Marissa of Oklahoma City, OK"
1877,I went to NYC this summer through a private room that I booked in Manhattan for a really good deal. I had been traveling from Penn station to the apartment since it was relatively close by foot so I walked. I had been contacting the host all day but I had no answer. And I even messaged her the days before and nothing. I arrive to the location and still I have not received any information from the host as to what apartment number. This was my first experience with Airbnb in NYC and I am 18 years old in this city. I contacted Airbnb after two hours of no contact with the hostess. She had read my texts but no answers. Airbnb then left me on hold for an hour and a half and when they contacted me the person who answered was not sure as to what to do.,5,"Maria of Miami, FL"
1878,"I rented a place in Las Vegas. It was everything described but when I went to check in it said my reservation had been cancelled and the clerk suggested I call the host. I called the host and co-host, phone #s have been disconnected, so had to get my tablet out and look at my email to call the host, explained what happened and by this time I was very stressed out. He took care of it and asked if this was the first time I rented from Airbnb, yes it was my first and certainly will be my last. ",5,"Nikki of Blanchard, OK"
1879,"I contacted the host to ensure I did not have a reservation within 24 hours of my inquiry. The reason why is the site said his place was inactive. He responded that he did not receive my request and noted he was booked in the same email exchange. Days before my trip, I received an inmail noting I was booked with him. I responded and reminded him of our previous conversation only to be told no, I was wrong. I have a long string of emails to prove I am right. Airbnb complaint did not resolve, they kept my money for the $1,800 booking. With proof of Suhail's emails noting I did not have a booking.",5,"Kelly of Franklin, TN"
1880,"First let me start by saying I have been a host and traveler on Airbnb for 2 years now. I have always had a good experience both hosting and traveling. That was until I actually had to reach out to Airbnb for assistance. My last reservations booked and stayed 5 nights within my home. Upon returning the day they checked out I found multiple damages in my home, one of which the guest told me about upfront. Both damages were very similar however the guest is only taking responsibility for minor damages and not all.

1882,"Hotels are expensive so the idea to rent a room with a local is a great option... However, I have tried it 3 times and each time, it was a pretty poor experience. Yes, the rent was low but so was the quality. My first experience in an ""urban"" location turned out to be a room in an very inconvenient location where I was kept awake most of the night by barking dogs and then awoken in the early morning by roosters! The bathroom was pretty dirty. Fortunately, I was only staying there one night so I held my tongue and coped. On the next two trips which were longer, I found dirty rooms full of mosquitoes, no hot water to shower and no air conditioning even though it was listed as an amenity. What do you do - you are basically stuck! ",5,"J of Staunton, VA"
1883,"I went to the area in advance hoping to at least drive by the property before committing thousands of dollars to the rental, Airbnb would not give me the address unless I paid up front with no option to cancel. Therefore I rented a property that was not as stated. Also, while there, a Hurricane came into my hometown. Airbnb was totally unhelpful in helping me resolve the issues of the home or in helping me if I needed to go home due to the storm. They totally leave every thing to the owner's discretion even though I rented through Airbnb.",5,"Katherine of Houston, TX"
1884,"Their customer service is wanting and so is the Airbnb.com site. It's not user-friendly at all and very confusing. They change it often so you never really become familiar with it. They must continue to get complaints about it if they have to change it so often. Also, because their policy is to never remove or edit a review or your response to a review, you can't dispute them even if you have documentation that the review/response is an error.

1885,"On two occasions, in a matter of hours, I registered to rent a vacation home on dates listed as available. I sent my credit card info and received a confirmation code for the rental and a confirmation of the charge which had immediately been made to my credit card account. Hours later I was contacted by the owner/host of the property telling me that it was not available on the dates I had booked and therefore my reservation was null and void. He stressed that he had told Airbnb that his property was not available on those dates yet they booked it anyway. I was at this time told by Airbnb that they would apply a credit of my payment to my next booking and refund the difference.",5,"NANCY of San Antonio, TX"

There are less than 100 legitimate vacation rentals in our area, but airbnb has over 300 listings because they are allowing Inns and B&B's to list their rooms individually. That's not the way a vacation rental website was meant to be and that's not what they advertise. Airbnb is trying to get business from priceline, groupon, travelociy and all the rest of the booking agencies that hotels and Inns use. Owners do not pay to list their property on airbnb, so why shouldn't they list as many rooms as they can.. ",5,"Ginny of Little River, CA"
1891,"Airbnb tried to cancel my reservation, stating that I could not assign the room I rented without their approval. Sorry, but, that's not the LAW and your unwritten policy does not trump my legal rights. This occurred after I tried to cancel with the host, giving a legitimate extenuating circumstance (their standard for cancellation without penalty), and an offer of some form of (25% of what I paid) cancellation feel; to rectify the hosts' inconvenience. The host told me ""no, that he would lose his 'super host status' (lie) and that I had to keep my reservations.""",5,"David of Kansas City, MO"
1892,"I have been a guest and host for Airbnb since 2007. I know how this business operates and how the website has been upgraded and changed, since I was one of the first to use it in 2007. I have over 40+, glowing reviews on my account, and have paid this business a LOT of money. I have been treated VERY unfairly recently, and the scenario follows:",5,"E of East Stroudsburg, PA"
1893,Dont believe in prices in site!!! You dont know the last price until the end of reservation. I booked a house for three nights and the price was 250 dollars per night but airbnb decided that I should pay 83 Dollars more!,5,"Arash of Istanbul, Other"
1894,"I was left completely stranded by Airbnb when my vacation rental fell through. I showed up to the unit with my 3 out-of-town family members and the vacation rental had not been cleaned since the previous occupants. The unit was also terribly maintained and did not look anything like the pictures displayed. While we were trying to contact the unit owner and discuss these issues with Airbnb, 3 of my friends showed up with $200 worth of groceries as they planned to BBQ with the family that day.",5,"Colleen of San Diego, CA"
