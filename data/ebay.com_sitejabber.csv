1,"eBay member since dec, 13 1998. Bret69 is my user name. Perfect feedback. Over 100 transactions. Last thing I sold, a $1000 lathe chuck, sold for $270 and a hold was placed on my funds for 1 month. eBay expected me to pay out of pocket to ship this heavy item across the country. I needed the funds from the sale to pay for shipping. I ended up refunding the money to the seller. I spent over an hour on the phone with them trying to get the $27 transaction fee reversed and was told the buyer had to initiate the cancellation of the transaction, which I have since learned is not true. I put a block on my bank account and now ebay is continually harassing me over non payment. They won't ever get a dime from me.

2,"Ebay protect its seller,  2009shoppingmall ( 157161 ), to deceive consumers by buying  good reviews by lying to her consumers that she will return their money if they re-write the review to good.

A buyer can get the review link only after they receive items. The link will complete shut off after reviewing. But the seller or ebay will reopen it only buyers agree to rewrite good one under the seller's lie returning money. Otherwise, consumers never have the access to review her product. That review access control by sellers for their benefits through  website operation under ebay website indicates that ebay involves in the deception. 
I also need to mention the seller, 2009shoppingmall (157161), uses misleading language to deceive consumer by calling the toy room dividers (big as a book) as room dividers.

And the seller usually sell not too expensive item, so buyers will not real send back. The seller is China even though she used English name email me. I came from China. I saw too many similar deception in China.  Most of sellers deceive buyers like her.

I sent him proof that the motor was incorrect and he still refused to provide shipping. eBay determined the motor was listed incorrectly and promised a full refund. I have yet to receive it and it's been a month. eBay tells me that I have to now fight with PayPal but I cannot submit a dispute through PayPal bc I did not purchase the item though PayPal. I cannot repair my vehicle bc I've not had a refund of my funds. I even offered to send the motor back when the refund was processed although eBay said I didn't have to and even though this seller was very belligerent. My advice is: Find someone else to purchase your parts through bc this company does not stand by their guarantees and warranties. I let him know the day we received it that it was incorrect. I'm still fighting to get someone to adhere to the policy and guarantee that I was provided upon purchase. It has been very difficult being without a car for so long and very a very difficult and extremely long process to get this corrected. It may not mean much to eBay and this seller but my car is the only transportation I have for myself and my son. My hope and prayer is that nothing emergent happens to either one of us or our pets while I'm waiting on this to be resolved bc we would be out of luck.

The buyer didn't respond and instead just ignored me for the entire returns period.

I was told by eBay support to wait for them to return and then I'd have a chance to inspect the item to check if it was ok before a refund was issued.

The item got lost in the post but royal mail marked it as delivered. eBay refunded the buyer anyway (I was told I would have time to inspect it but the refund happened immediately when it was delivered). 

Royal Mail has admitted fault but won't refund. Similarly, eBay are telling me to take it up with the buyer and are taking no responsibility.

92,"Do you want to ""check-out"" the opposition?, the other people bidding on the item that interests you?, well you SHOULD.

Follow these simple steps to get SOME idea about the other bidders in your auction, and perhaps (as in my case) spot a SCAMMER.

Your ""username"" is encrypted when you bid...encrypted by eBay *twice*, to protect? well, that's questionable.

1, Find an item of interest (good start)
2, CLICK on the bids already made

3, Find yourself in BID HISTORY with a list of the bidders in this auction, along with the TIME and DATE bids were made, and at the bottom (if applicable) any BID retraction/cancellation history.

4, Now CLICK on a ""name"" to be taken to BID HISTORY ID of that bidder.

You are now looking at the bidding history of the the opposition, and also (importantly) it's history with the seller in question. 

*Note the different encrypted ID*? (top left) 

In this section you are told of the % of bids by this bidder that went to the SELLER IN QUESTION, and lets not forget the RETRACTION history of this bidder (if any) found at the bottom right hand side.

Please note that these details cover both a 30 day & 6 Month period? so will REDUCE if this bidder is inactive, and would/could go down to ZERO bid history (with seller) & zero retractions?...Umm.  

Please also note that your encrypted ID?  will remain the same for you for as long as you bid on the same sellers auctions...unless eBay try anymore funny business?

And the encrypted ID already IN ""BID HISTORY ID""?
Is the ORIGINAL encrypted bidder ID of this bidder, as seen when it WAS bidding in the SAME sellers auctions, changed (I believe) by eBay to ""muddy the water"", and protect shill bidders, and in so doing? protect it's 10% ""cut"" of any scam.

I have 3 sellers (of Sony Laptops) in mind, and can ID them AS THEY BID in eachothers auctions, AND I can place them (as sellers, so as bidders) at the SAME address of

Beresford Avenue
Coventry
CV6 6JA  

And eBay? ACT like the THREE WISE monkeys.

A TEST FOR YOU.
Are you currently bidding on an item?, if so TRY THIS.

Ask your friend (via his/her eBay account) to access the auction you are bidding on,  go to BID HISTORY and see if he/she can ID YOU.

POINTERS
Take you User ID (I'm removaldog)  
take 2 random letters, and *** and lets not forget your feedback score?, AKA a SCAMMERS FINGERPRINT.

I have called EBay twice and one rep said to try back in a couple of years while the second rep said indefinitely.  I cannot believe the coldness in which this is being done as I have hundreds of listings, spent countless hours taking photos, researching and writing descriptions for each item, ALL FOR NOTHING.

I really feel he is flim-flaming the public with this fraudulent activity.

I said No and requested the refund.  It has been 2 weeks and many excuses later - no action.

This seller is obviously not an honest one.  But even filing a complaint with EBAY brought me no results.  I protested the charge.

I would sell 10 items in a day and have 3 false complaints against me.  Buyers now buy broken new items, jump on EBay looking for a new one, buy it and claim shipping damage and mail you back the broken one.  FedEx and USPS will not pay for a lot of those claims, not that I feel they should.  I dont even put the claim in.   Buyers are not returning items sent, they will put something totally different in the box or send a used item back, either way Ebay rules in their favor.  On top of that Ebay then reduces your seller rating when you try and fight the fraudulent buyer.   In the end it became that 20-30 percent of my sales were by buyers who are looking to steal from you and they get away with it.  Sellers are making a exodus and so will legitiment buyers when they can no longer find what they are looking for.

EBay is seriously the company I hate the most on this planet. 
What I hate the most about them, is their customer service. Their representative are LIARS, RACISTS, UNFAIR DOUCHBAGS and will treat you like a dog if you re not a professional big seller. 

Heres what they did to me recently :

After 4 years of loyalty and use of their selling platform, as a seller I sold hundreds of items and had a 99,7% of positive feedback. But somehow they decided my performances as a seller were poor, and just because I canceled some of my sales for not having the item in stock anymore, they decided to BLOCK MY SELLER ACCOUNT FOREVER. Thats right, after all these years of loyalty and hard work to maintain a good positive feedback, they bashed/destroyed all my projects, plan, business on eBay just like that, without ANY PRIOR WARNING, not even a temporary restriction to start with. No, they instantly banned me from eBay for life!
Can you believe this??
The worst thing is that I spent these last few years buying stuff in bulk to re-sell them later as a professional seller. I invested a lot of time and money in this company FOR NOTHING, I lost a lot of money and I am stock with lots of objects I cant Re-sell anymore!

Moreover, their customer service is insanely discriminating and treat their users differently according to their influence on eBay as a seller. If youre one of the top professional sellers they will always treat you nicely and will accept yo modify a negative feedback whenever you ask them to do it. If youre just an average seller they will lie to you and say they cant do anything for you! I swear Ive got many proofs about this, happened to me many many time, They take the most illogical and absurd decisions, their follow up is complete BS since its never the same representative should replies back, they always change to confuse you and they all have the same generic, idiotic and repetitive responses, in other words youre dealing with robots, not human beings!

162,"DO NOT use ebay...I am done with them once and for all. I have been a seller and buyer for a number of years of and on because stupid stuff keeps happening and I am never covered for the lies other people fed to ebay about the situation; I'm usually the honest one. I first had a lady buy some dishes and I thoroughly packed them, when she got them somehow they all ended up broken except a plate and the mugs which she had told me before buying them that she was only interested in the mugs. In the photos she provided she showed a HUGE knife with a good sized handle that she could have used to break these dishes to get a full refund and keep the mugs. I had filed with Fedex for insurance which if you ever deal with that kind of thing it takes at least a month , but she got impatient with me and filed a claim against me requesting all of her money returned when she should have only gotten a partial shipping fee returned and partial refund on the item as she had a plate and 3 or 4 mugs. Ebay sided with her even though I went out of my way to file a claim when she should have done this...her sob story was she had cancer and needed the money, even though I was sitting there facing lyme disease and other health problems that were keeping me in bed. We had a few other similar dealing like this. Now as a buyer I am having issues with them again...I bought saddle corner plates and turns out I can't find the proper hardware to attach them to a new saddle so I contacted the seller and he immediately had ebay open a case against me and they immediately closed the case in his favor not allowing me to respond and give my side of the story. I appeal and I am still waiting on a response, this same seller accepted a return of another plate I bought from him and his lame excuse is he miss read and clicked the wrong thing. I never asked for him to pay return shipping just for my money to be refunded once the item got returned to him. After all is said and done with the mess I have on ebay...I will be boycotting them FOREVER! We have lost a lot of money selling (when we could have donated for free and not lost anything) and from buying with buyers getting away with stuff...I never have any cases rule in my favor as a buyer or seller...please be warned and do not sell or buy from them!",1,“Safe bet to lose your money as a buyer or seller”

It is necessary to force the sellers to assign the track numbers, they are given for any given when sending. I can not leave a negative review to the seller, it took 45 days from the date of purchase, obscurantism, stupid and unworked site, stupid support",1,“stupid ebay” 
164,"I was with ebay for a long time and did a lot of business on there, unfortunately towards the end of my time there an awful lot of issues arose which they handled very poorly.

I honestly don't know what all these buyers are talking about when they say Ebay protects sellers only, it seems to me that their whole policy is to automatically side with the buyer whenever a dispute comes up.

I used to send out many deliveries and always made a point of retaining postage certificates to prove that I had done my bit and sent the item out. However, ebay is never willing to accept that there may be fraudulent buyers out there who will receive an item then claim they haven't got it so as to get their money back. Whenever an 'item not received' case was opened I showed ebay the proof of postage but all they would say was 'do you have a tracking number'. The answer was always no because tracking numbers cost so much.

And guess what? They always sided with the buyer because 'there was no proof it had been delivered'. Unfortunately ebay, it is not the seller's job to ensure it is delivered, merely to send it. And given that the buyer could not prove the item hadn't arrived and I COULD prove it had been sent, i thought it was criminal to keep giving them their money back.

Also, do not bother reporting other users to them- I had to report the same buyer for threats, abuse and blackmail three times and nothing was ever done.

There were also multiple occasions when buyers left negative feedback even though it was clear that they had just failed to read the description of what they were buying. I spoke to ebay to ask them to remove this feedback but they said they wouldn't because 'it would be overriding the desires of the buyer'.

No. It isn't. It is ensuring that I am not punished for the buyer's failure or refusal to look at what they're buying before clicking 'Purchase'.

What was really laughable was when i had buyers request to return items (again, they were unhappy because they hadn't looked at the item description). And when i put this case to Ebay, and mentioned the fact that I don't accept returns in the first place, what did they do? They made me accept the return anyway! 

They didn't seem too bothered about overriding my page policies.

But here is the worst thing: i had to go away over the summer so was not able to dispatch orders during that period. For some reason Ebay do not let you put up a notice saying when you're away unless you're a Business page which I wasn't. But the orders kept coming in while I was away, and i spent hours messaging all buyers individually to let them know of the delay.

Sadly but maybe unsurprisingly, not all of them were willing to cooperate and opened up a large number of cases against me, ignoring what I had said. This was not ebay's fault, but what was their fault was the fact that when I returned and asked ebay to close the cases and showed them that I had done everything within my power to explain things to my buyers, they weren't interested and kept all the cases open.

This wouldn't have been such a problem if they hadn't put my account performance onto a 'Below Standard' setting because of the number of open cases, which means that after three months your selling privileges are permanently suspended if you can't get it back above standard.

I spoke to Ebay about how to deal with this and they told me to close all the cases and that would sort it. However, this was a lie.

I spent the next five weeks dealing with uncooperative buyers in order to get the cases closed and upon doing it, Ebay then said I had to mark all incoming orders as Shipped. I did this, no change. I ended up speaking to them another two or three times and each time they brushed me off with some other task to accomplish.

Basically they have barred me from ever selling on ebay again because of a problem they caused, wouldn't let me rectify, and then punished me for not rectifying it. Seems fair doesn't it?

But don't worry, they said I can still buy from them!

I would avoid this place, it has just become a paradise for fraudulent buyers.",1,“Fraudster's Playground”

 Wont someone please develop an app or selling site simple and straightforward like Poshmark has? for the stuff Posh doesnt allow to sell on their site! I think the person who develops it ,will be the next Billionaire.
Ebay punishes you for mistakes, like not being able to find one item I sold. I contacted the buyer they were fine and understood. Ive sold over 100 items and get punished for 1 mistake.  
 Yet when there are glitches on their end, like not being able to checkout my cart. Or cant print shipping label for hours.They dont offer any compensation.

I have used ebay to buy an used GPU. I paid in full amount instantly with valid credit card and my money got exchanged to usd.

My payment refund became pending for 5 days.

Ebay says it protects buyers but what happened here is
1. I lost my time because my money got stuck on pending for 5 days
2. I lost money because my money got exchanged to usd and not refunded back to my credit card.

eBay policy breach: Feedback Extortion

Hello XXXXXXXXXXX,
Weve looked at your eBay account and see that some of your actions do not follow eBay's Feedback Extortion policy. As a result, we've taken the following steps:
- The following feedback you left has been removed:

Using the feedback or detailed seller ratings (DSR) systems in exchange for any of the following isn't allowed:

Buyer:
- Forcing a seller to provide goods and services that weren't included in the original item's description.
- Demanding a return or refund.

Seller:
- Requiring buyers to leave positive feedback or DSR in exchange for receiving the purchased item.
- Offering monetary compensation or an additional item in exchange for positive feedback or DSR.

For more information on this eBay feedback policy, go to:
http://pages.ebay.com.au/help/policies/feedback-extortion.html

I find this email highly offensive, contentious and borderline slanderous. 
Not only have they taken my rights away as consumer they are hiding the truth away from potential customers who may think that same item is great when it isn't. eBay have also managed to make me feel like a criminal...because that's what extortion is, it's a criminal act.
When you try to lodge a complaint to eBay it's like banging your head into a brick wall with only half hearted answers, like you shouldn't feel like this. Anyone would be upset to be accused of extortion when you did no such thing.",1,“Being called an extortionist” 
194,"Customer service is one of the worst in the business.  When you need to return something, you are only given 5 business days, but the seller has 6 days to give your refund.

Unfortunately, the post office claims there has been a delay in delivering my package to the seller with no explanation.  Please beware when ordering on Ebay as you may never receive a refund.",1,“No Refund”

Little did I now that in the sales agreement, the buyer had so and so days to request a refund and so they did! They received the code and took back their money fraudulently. I forwarded this information soon after in a report to eBay. What did they do? They absolutely ignored my concerns and charged me $14 for the posting, which I paid. I wish I didn't, because I made postings shortly after that didn't sell and then they charged me an addition $17, though I made no profit. This time I refused to pay and now they've deleted my account. I hope the karma they receive is suitable to their sociopathic nature as a company.",1,“They Don't Care About Sellers”

It was an address I had absolutely no connection with and the nickname is not something I would ever do. Ebay continued to say it wasnt their fault and they couldnt do anything about it. The constantly pushed it off and refused to help. I spent hours on the phone with them. One order I wound up paying more in shipping and the other just got sent back to the  seller. I am so tired of companies who teach their customer service to not listen to what is being said but just read disclaimers from a screen and Ebay clearly is one of these.

If you give someone your phone number you automatically pay a final value fee, even if the item does not sell.  Even if you dont know that was a violation. Even for car stuff and cars which it says you can list your phone number on their own website. If you have an issue a non US person will always tell you theres nothing they can do.

I also had to pay shipping both ways. On top of that, I was charged over $20 for the return policy. Its ridiculous as I followed the rules and policies to the letter and I was cheated.

Tip for eBay appreciate your sellers more and you might attract some more trusted businesses and retailers that run to Amazon!!!

Another terrible part of the eBay seller experience is the fact they take buyers word for if an item was delivered late. Well if you're providing them with a 2 day delivery time for 2nd class which is actually 2-3 working days, then they're going to think it's late!!!!! 

You cannot rate a seller on their delivery times based on what buyers constitute as being late. You should only rely on the actual tracked items.

The danger for consumers is that, because of eBay's vast reach and the millions of part-time, non VAT-registered sellers, many businesses are often selling at lower prices than on their own website, despite eBay's ever-increasing charges (remember when they were about 5% and no fees on postage?).

The consequence could be that in another decade or two, nearly all internet sales are handled through third party sites like eBay and Amazon. Businesses will basically no longer be independent, increasing amounts of merchandise will be banned as they are deemed politically incorrect (such as all Confederate flag items, as just one example).

They will be able to set prices by setting their fees and we will only have easy access to the books they think we ought to read and the music and films we should own and the food we should eat.

247,"I have been a TOP SELLER in both the United States and the UK.
Because of scamming buyers and the fact tracking wasn't available, some demanded full refund for non receipt. I offered to re-send product, but instead of responding, they just escalated to eBay.

And for this, 6 of these cases out of 670, eBay punished me by making my Global Seller Rating: Below Average. Just one case was actually in the global region, the rest were in the US/UK/Germany.

I thought it won't matter since I was still a TOP SELLER in the US & UK.    WROOOONG

I started selling on eBay again, subscribed to an eBay store subscription and to my HORROR I saw no one was even finding my listings!!! I couldn't find them in search either!!!

eBay support repeteadly said BOGUS reasons, that it's because I'm searching my own listings, because people from other regions see other results, but that's NOT IT! Before I could find them!

TURNS OUT just because my global seller status dropped below average, not only no one from worldwide can see my listings in search results, BUT NO ONE FROM THE REGIONS I STILL HAVE TOP SELLER STATUS CAN FIND MY LISTINGS EITHER !!!!

EBAY INTENTIONALLY SABOTAGED AND CENSORED MY LISTINGS WITHOUT EVEN INFORMING ME BEFORE NOT ONLY PAYING $$$$ FOR MANY EBAY LISTING FEATURES TO BE SHOWN EVERYWHERE, BUT NOT EVEN INFORMING ME NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO FIND MY LISTINGS BEFORE SUBSCRIBING TO THEIR STORE SUBSCRIPTION !!!!!

I tried everything, contacted them over x20 times ... NOTHING!!!! It's like they intentionally want to sabotage us!

I tried to cancel the eBay store subscription and to my HORROR it wanted to charge me $94 for early termination fee !!!! FOR WHAT ?!?!?! THEY ALREADY CHARGED US $20 FOR A STORE THAT IS CENSORED AND HIDDEN AND BASICALLY FOR A SERVICE NOT PROVIDED !!!!!!!!

	I contacted Support to cancel the early termination fee, and support said to cancel my subscription and have my account charged $94 and to contacted them again for a refund.
	When I contacted them for a refund, they said I'd have to wait until next month when the invoice arrives, to ""try and request a crediting of my account and hope it gets approved"" .... TO TRY AND REQUEST ?!?!? As if it's at their discretion to commit fraud and theft for services not provided ?!?!?!?!?
	I contacted them next month, they didn't reply, had to pester them and eventually told me they're sorry they can't refund me anything because my account has been credited last month, when in fact ebay support specifically said they won't credit me anything for my listing fees for listings which were censored intentionally without informing me before hand !!
And after that they dared to say ""we value your business and as an eBay seller"" and wishing me good health ---- simply outrageous and insulting !!
So what happened: Even though support said they won't credit me anything for the listing fees, seems someone intentionally credited my account without informing me a measly $0.61 (61 cents) just so they'd have an excuse not to refund the illegally and fraudulently charge of $94 for an early termination fee of an eBay store that was CENSORED and useless TO BEGIN WITH !!!

eBay fraudulently charged me $114 for services which they intentionally DID NOT PROVIDE !!!

eBay sabotaged my business and nearly bankrupted me if it wasn't for Amazon ... killing my future and future businesses I would go and create.

eBay lied, stole and abused at every turn

eBay shouldn't have restricted my ability to sell in the US & UK regions since I still had and have top seller status there, or at least they should have informed me before hand !!!! BEFORE comitting to spend money!!!

	I went to BBB to no avail, they're useless and eBay just gave me copy-paste templates. More so, I suspect going to BBB is what triggered them to intentionally sabotage me further by crediting my account with $0.61 just so they'd have an excuse not to refund the illegal charges.
	They then proceeded to threats that if I don't pay they'll send collection agencies ... 

	They limited my account and put it on hold.

	I paid their fraudulent $117 charge (they put penalties on it) and asked for my account to be reinstated. I asked when will my global seller rating be reset.

	NO RESPONSE WHAT-SO-EVER. THEY STOLE MY MONEY AND BURIED ME TO THE GROUND!

I swear, because of this, I'll make it one of my life's purpose to see this thieving and fraudulent company burned into the ground, along with everyone that was complicit to this sabotage, from support members to key people that put such illegal policies into place brought to justice.

And I urge everyone to do the same, everyone who's ever been wronged by eBay, to stand up and bring it to justice! To expose eBay for the thieving, fraudulent, mafia-like monster that it is!

255,"I'm very disappointed with Ebay policy to defend dishonest sellers.
I reporting a situation that could occur for an item worth250 or 2500 dollars.
Fortunately I only lost 25 dollars..but some Chinese seller won it.

I was unable to select an automatic resolution for this transaction.
I was having trouble with this item XX seller by this seller ioomobile.
The product has been sent rapidly (in one week or so), but the time interval given by the seller is one month (more than time to avoid any return from paypal, bank or other payment method).
Product has been stuck in custom (Portugal, an EU country), I don't understand why, because I've order tents of things, even from China\Malasia\Hong Kong, and never occur before. Is there a possibility that the seller hasn't done the paper billings right to avoid paying taxes? I'm very suspicious about that.
However, I don't have any responsibility for the item going to custom, and no information about this situation is reported in the item description. 
Other strange situation was that after this transaction, the remaining item available has raised its price to 500 euros (I bought this for 22 euros). This is a very strange situation and, if not legal,very suspicious to say the least.

I have reported this situation to Ebay's email, customerhelp.at.ebay.com, because the seller has given a time wind of one month (previously pointed out), so no automatically mechanism were available on ebay site to ask for anything that could be asked for (help, refund, cancel transaction, whatever..). Moreover, all the structure, organization and ways to do anything on Ebay's site when I problem arouses to the seller is incredibly not clear and almost impossible to get anything done.
The answer from ebay, by email, was that I needed to give the seller time to make things right (not sure what that means..) and that probably I would have my money back or partial refund (some sand to people's eyes, like we say in my country).
When this one month window ended I logged in on ebay and asked for a refund in this item\transaction site. What happens next is surreal. The seller in a few minutes canceled the refund, asked to Ebay to step in (what ever that means..), and finally the decision was made to not refund and to close this case. I have appealed to reopen the case, with the argument that the item was going back to the seller, because that's what happens when you do not pay the custom charges. In only a few minutes Ebay has refuted this appeal with the argument that the custom charges should be paid by the buyers. 
At the end the only person that was impaired in this situation was me (the buyer).
I'm not buying this custom charges history, and that's how some company in China makes money without given away its items.

And that's my story, not buying on Ebay again, for sure.",1,“Do not buy IOOMOBILE \ JETSO MOBILE \\ Ebay do not supports customers” 
256,"After years of buying and selling with ebay.com we reached a point where we needed to call in and find out exactly what's going on over there. We spoke to a manager regarding their assumptions on how we run our business and the ability they provide buyers to discredit sellers through feedback. 

Our company has over 2400 positive feedback with eBay and pays them on average $1500/month. We have been in business for 19 years and run a tight ship. Ebay's listing search programming is directly related to your feedback...meaning when you receive a negative feedback your listings will be dumped at the bottom of search results.

That being said, we took the appropriate measures and still received a negative feedback from a buyer trying to take advantage of the system. When we spoke to the customer support manager at eBay he verbatim said ""the eBay feedback platform does not fall under any defamation of character laws."" How is this even legal? It practically falls somewhere between bribery and extortion.

Can someone please address this. We feel like we've invested so much of our time, energy, and money into eBay. Their treatment of a loyal and punctual paying customer is absurd. Thanks in advance.

After almost a month of back and forth with eBay and Paypal, even having Microsoft write a full documented report of the cover-up attempt, I received word this morning that Paypal had sided with the merchant and there would be no return or refund for my $800 purchase. They did say I could appeal, so this evening I went back to the Mircosoft store to meet with the Store Manager to get yet another evaluation of the fraudulent purchase. Only things didn't turn out that way, Mircosoft didn't want to write another evaluation, they had decided they wanted to make things right and refund me the amount this unit cost when it was new...$1250!

I no longer use EBay and hope PayPal doesn't suck the way EBAY did and does.

The downsides of EBAY are that many traditional sellers are either dumb-dumbs and/or working full time jobs elsewhere. Many are dishonest or just uneducated and do not pay a lot of attention to their storefronts. Youre basically going to a garage sale and rummaging through hoping for a bargain basement deal while getting terrible service.

The best sellers on ebay used to be overseas (mostly Chinese) merchants who were legit full-time businesses. Those sellers can now be found on other wesbites.

EBAY has lost its original purpose and now has terrible partnerships with big name brands. It doesn't work as a straight retail or discount site because the thrill of cheap finds and winning auctions is now gone AND the non-negotiable ""buy it now"" prices can't compete with other discount retailers like TJ Maxx, Burlington, Amazon or even Target.

325,"I have been an Ebay Seller since 2002.  Ebay makes all of their money from the fees they charge sellers, yet they favor buyers who may or may not be truthful about their complaint.  They don't have a good system in place to verify that a buyer's complaint is legitimate.  They will always side with the Buyer, i.e. if the Buyer says it, it must be true!!??  Ebay won't even allow sellers to leave negative or even neutral feedback on a buyer's account, yet will allow buyers to leave negative feedback on a seller's account, even if it is unwarranted.  Ebay makes about $1100/mo in fees off of my seller's account and yet provided me no protection whatsoever when I had the misfortune of a dishonest buyer who purchased one of my new items and returns it used, claimed the item was not as described when it was most definitely accurately described, and then returned the item for a full refund plus $35 in shipping costs both ways.  Ebay stepped in and took control of the return process as soon as the buyer made a complaint and issued the buyer a return label, then charged my account for the shipping charges.  Ebay didn't even communicate with me about this until after the return had already been processed and my account charged, and did not provide me with any kind of tracking number so that I knew what was going on.  In addition, the return address that Ebay provided on the shipping label was incorrect, so the package was not returned to me, but to some other address.  When I received an email that the package had been returned and my account charged, I called Ebay to inquire about the location of my package, since I knew that I hadn't received it.  I was told that it was delivered to a different address an hour away from my house and that I would be responsible for retrieving my package, AND that Ebay would not cover me for the value of the package, if I wasn't successful in retrieving the package.  The Ebay representative told me that I should consider it ""the cost of doing business,"" i.e. write it off as a business loss, since I have a business account.  No apology, no concern over the loss of my package, just detest for bothering them with my problem, and rudely telling me to just ""suck it up."" I was told during my initial call to Ebay about this whole ordeal that I would be allowed to go through an appeals process once I received the package back, and that I would be able to inspect the package before issuing the buyer a refund.  However, that didn't turn out to be the case at all.  Ebay again just took control and went ahead and refunded the buyer for the full amount once tracking confirmation showed the package had been delivered....to the wrong house...without having a chance to inspect the package.  For all I know, there's a big rock in the package and the buyer kept the items I sent, valued at over $200.  And when I called to initiate the appeals process after the return, they said I would not be able to do an appeals process because the package was delivered to the wrong address.  So let me get this straight, Ebay.  You only took the buyer's word about the complaint while completely ignoring my input, even though I have 100% positive from many, many transactions and the buyer has a grand total of 3 feedbacks on her account, then took control of my return, charged me for it, didn't provide me with the tracking number, shipped the package to the wrong address, shipped the package uninsured and without signature confirmation, will require me to drive an hour to go knock on some stranger's door and ask if they have my package, won't cover me for the value of the package should I be unsuccessful in retrieving it, lied to me about being able to do an appeal, lied to me about being able to inspect the package before issuing the buyer a refund, all while charging me $1100/mo in fees for their kind services?  No thanks Ebay!!  I have had my fill of your company and the lack of support your provide to sellers.  I don't pay $1100/mo in Ebay fees to be dumped on like this.  There are other options for sellers out there and I will be moving over to Amazon, and closing my Ebay account.  Goodbye $1100/mo in revenue, which is a drop in the bucket compared to how much they make from sellers collectively, so I'm sure they don't care.  BTW, Ebay has increased their fees 200% since I started selling on Ebay in 2002.  Amazons fees are much more reasonable.  To current sellers on Ebay:  proceed at your own risk because if this happens to you, good luck trying to get any recourse from Ebay!

i want to sell my car, i have an ipad 2. so i sign up. all going well so far. i start my ad on the classic uploader. many fields won't work so can't post. so i try the advanced option and try again. i get to the photo uploader. browse it says, so i browse. i pick a picture then it goes back to page and tells me 0 photos selected. i try many times in many ways. not one error message to say what's wrong. nothing! so i think ok, i'll download the app, go through all that to then be informed i can't sell my car on the app!!! so i think i'll use my partners laptop. i have to send the photos on my ipad to him. one lot sends, the other won't, not ebay fault but i'm sure you can imagine my utter frustration at this point. so i try my google browser on my phone. the browse button now accepts my pic. one at a time...after pressing five different buttons to get to the photo i want. i eventually put nine in and press upload. at this point my phone rings, i've lost my google page. i'm now really hoping the photos and ebay are doing their thing in the background and when i sign back in my photos will be there.... guess what? no photos and i'm back to the hell that is square one! thanks ebay, nice to know your down with the kids using techy stuff like ipads, i know they've only been around about 15 years! from my ipad i've uploaded to autotrader, gumtree. amazon...photos that is, yet ebay ... not a hope! won't be selling my car on there even if i managed to get through the minefield of uploading simple photos!

First, we all have Iphones and Mac products as evidenced by any purchase activity. Second, I would never bid on that phone on Ebay, especially if the seller is in the UK.  I called Ebay and spend several minutes speaking to a rep. in/from the Philippines. She assured me that it would be taken care of.  Two days later, I see a demand for payment from Ebay.  I call them immediately and get another rep from the Philippines. I end up relaying the same information as if I never made the initial call to Ebay.  I also uncovered that my account was hacked and the hacker changed my address to one in Brooklyn--never received the warning e-mails about account changes from Ebay.  On the real, I think Ebay screwed this up because the address actually belonged to an electronic store in Brooklyn that deals with the disputed item.

Listen if you are a buyer it is wonderful because you are guaranteed your money back no matter what. This wonderful money back guarantee is also taken advantage by scammer buyers or buyers that are unreasonable.

As a seller please be advised that you SHOULD NOT SELL any HIGH priced item on ebay. I would recommend that nothing you put up for sale should be over $500.
Most recently I was scammed by a buyer. She purchased my item should. Had the item for almost three weeks then files a claim that my item doesnt seen authentic. Why? because it smells funny the serial number on the authenticity card does not match the serial number in the bag an d that the dust bag is totally fake. I told her that my bag had no smells and that she must have been mistaken because the brand of bag that I sold her does not come with an authenticity card and as such she never received any card for any comparison.  I also said that it was strange that she only had these complaints after having the bag for three weeks. I called in and found out that she bought bag through ebay uk even though I shipped bag to a Canadian address and as such ebay UK will be handling the case. HUH????
  Ebay asked buyer to provide documentation to substantiate her claimed that the bag didnt seem authentic. Buyer never did that and time ticked away as they waited. They added extra days for her to come up with the document. Meanwhile my Paypal account went into negative because of this dispute. No additional communication from ebay and buyer.  I called on the deadline date and was ultimately told that, according to ebay UK,  even though the buyer did not provide any documents a buyer has a right to return bag under any circumstances. I was told that this is the cost of doing e commerce. I was even asked to pay return shipping. 
So imagine this BUYER used the HIGH priced bag for THREE weeks before filing bogus complaint. Buyer had bag for an additional THREE weeks during the sham dispute process. Buyer did not provide any documentation. Buyer now has opportunity to return bag after having it for total SIX weeks. BUT WAIT its gets better!!! Ebay has no way of knowing in what condition buyer will send back item or worse yet if buyer returns the same item that was sent. As a seller, you are out of luck either way. Buyers have figured out the loop holes and are buying things to either test and return for refund or they are buying with the intention of doing the old switcheroo. Once you (as the seller) receive the item and its not what you sold or it is damaged, used and abused, you are out of luck as Ebay will tell you they have no way of knowing what was sent or what was received. They will tell you to file a police report. There are so many sellers that have been scammed by this new wave of over confident buyer/scammers. Please heed my advice. Do not list anything on Ebay that you cant afford to give away. 
Sellers have no protection!!!!",1,“Ebay is a horrible place for SELLERS” 
360,"If you're trying to sell a few of your own items on ebay then please save your time, money and energy to find a different site or just gift/donate them to people. It is just not worth it. The fees alone will devalue what you think you're getting for your items. In addition they will never charge the appropriate amount for shipping, they will take fees off of your shipping cost and then for some reason randomly not charge the initial shipping price until you receive a monthly invoice that is an absurd amount. On selling $100 worth of items in 3 auctions I owed $32 on the invoice. $20 was for a shipping label that they only charged $18 for, took a $3 fee from and I still spent $16 out of pocket for the materials to ship.

363,"Interestingly, whenever I made a purchase from eBay and didn't get it, I got no help in obtaining a refund and was stiffed.  But now that I've sold things on eBay WOW have I gotten ripped off by buyers and eBay seems to be okay with that.  Two times I've buyers claimed items arrived empty when I'm sure they didn't, but I ended up having to refund.  The most recent offense was that I advertised an expensive brand (made in France) cast iron casserole which was in very good condition.  It was just an older one that ended up not being used regularly (literally used once) because it was so heavy. Newer casseroles in that size from that brand now range in price at  $300+ at retail, but they have a different knob and color interior enamel.  Buyer claimed I sold him a new (shows what good condition it was in) ""fraudulent product Made in China, not France.""  I provided evidence of authenticity, but then buyer changed story because he knew he couldn't use that excuse and claimed I said the exact same product sells for $300 at retail so he could file for a refund saying I misrepresented it in the product.  I said ""same brand/size casserole"" ran that price (actually they run more), knowing I could not say it was exactly the same because they don't sell that one anymore. He then messaged me, after his first really nasty/threatening message and tried to play to my sympathy saying he had kids in college, etc. and I should just refund the money (after 1st message threatening me).  I replied that I was out of work, had a broken wrist, and was trying to sell items to scale down for a move to a smaller apartment, so we all have problems. Sure he was trying to manipulate me, I looked up his name on LinkedIn, and the dude has an high level IT job, so he's not exactly hurting.  He's just a jerk. For all I know his kids might live with an ex and he might be behind on child support - or he might not have any.  I called eBay and messaged through their system that the guy was manipulating their system and I shouldn't be on the hook for that.  I noted that he could have asked me about the product beforehand if he had concerns and I would have directed him to the website where I purchased it for evidence (just as I did when he made his claim afterward), but he didn't and that ample photos were provided in the listing.  He was just upset that his product was sold on QVC vs. Williams Sonoma, apparently.  I guess it wasn't posh enough a pedigree for him.  Regardless, it was the same brand and was Made in France.  The person I spoke with at eBay agreed that I did not misrepresent the item when she read my messages and reviewed the listing.  She said to file a counter claim, which I did. I was confident they'd see this was a manipulation by the buyer.  The next day, eBay sided with the buyer anyhow and now I also have to pay return shipping too for this very heavy item that's going across the entire country back to me.  So I'm out nearly $160 (with shipping, packing, and fees) now over a $75.00 sale! I am closing my account with eBay after this and will NEVER use their service again.  If they will not honestly review these claims with an unbiased view, then I cannot risk losing money every time I list with them, least of all when I'm unemployed.  I should be charging them for taking so much time away from my job hunt to resolve this ridiculous case.  I had 100% ratings - both as a buyer and a seller prior to this incident, btw, with buyers noting my items were ""as described"" and ""well packaged"" and my communication with them was good.",1,“No protection from fraudulent buyers”

365,"I purchased a car through ebay motors from Seller joegeeting which does business as:
Liberty Auto Exchange
069 Pines Rd.
Etters, PA 17319

After Purchasing the vehicle had many mechanical problems.  Spent over 3000 dollars in repairs.  I left a negative feedback on ebay.  The owner of Liberty Auto Exchange contested the negative feedback.  This then involved net neutrals to review the case and determine if the feedback I left should be removed.  

In responding to net neutrals, I uploaded my receipts for parts ordered for the repairs and also indicated that the car was in much worse shape than what the listing led one to believe.  The car was snowed in for a week or so and when the transport company went to to pickup the car, no inspection could be done since the car was filthy and no one was around from this used car dealer - they just left the keys for them.  The transport company noted that they could not inspect the vehicle upon pickup since no one from the dealer was around.

Upon receiving the vehicle the key fob had no battery and when batteries were inserted, the car would not lock or unlock correctly.  In order to operate the car the batteries from the key fob had to be removed.  It was very apparent why the dealer removed the batteries.  The dealer said the car was probably damaged in transit.  Throwing out such a statement was ridiculous.  If the dealer knew an inspection would be done when the car was picked up with them there, they purposely were not present because an inspection would have been done and the problems would have been discovered.  Net neutrals made the assumption the car was damaged in transit in spite of no indication as such.  I uploaded my receipts for repairs to prove what shape the car was in.  Net neutrals stated I should have included mechanic reports of the problems.  If they want this, I could have went to the mechanics to get this information.  

It has become apparent that net neutrals in not neutral in any sense of the word.  
I normally don't purchase cars through ebay.  This was my first and last time.  Ebay removed my feedback based on a technicality.  First time purchasers of a car through ebay would not be astute enough to cover all the details to protect themselves from purchasing a car from a user car dealer in another state.

Do yourself a favor, do not purchase an auto through ebay  Pictures can be VERY deceiving.  Buy locally where you can go and see the car and protect yourself.

I will NEVER purchase anything of any significant value from Ebay and I encourage you to do the same.

One final note, I received a message through my Ebay message box telling me of their decision.  When I attempt to respond to this email, in my Ebay message box I get an unknown error.  If I test a response to other messages in my Ebay message box, I can respond, however for this notification message which does not state that I should not respond, I get an error when I do respond.  Apparently Ebay does not want to communicate any further on this purchase.

I will be closing my account in a few days.  I am done with Ebay.

370,"My experience with ebay has been absolutely horrible. They will respond to your inquiries but will never do any follow-up work to resolve the issue. 

In a nutshell, this is what happened.....

I purchased 4 outfits from a seller, the items were shipped and I received them in a timely manner. None of items were as described or listed. I contacted the seller and we had a Whatsapp conversation in which I informed him the items that were sent were not as expected, he went on to try and convince me that what I received is a better product and that I don't know anything. The seller admitted to not providing me with what I thought I had purchased. The seller was condescending and didn't want to listen to anything I had to say. I was finally successful in getting a return address from him to send the items back. 

The next day, I went to FedEx and spent $450 to ship these items back. On the FedEx website, it showed my delivery was in transit for 5 months. I contacted FedEx and finally they were able to tell me the seller didn't complete the paperwork and the package was abandoned. Once I got this information, I have been in constant communication with ebay and they are unwilling to step up to even investigate. I have asked for someone to call me to discuss and this is a difficult task for ebay to complete. 

Finally, my last recourse is I went back to my credit card company and asked them to charge back the seller. Fingers crossed, that they will be able to finally settle and close this dispute. 

After this experience, I will never deal with ebay again and will ensure people are aware of their business practices. I shop on Amazon all the time and have never run into any problems. Amazon truly cares about its buyers and makes sure they are completely satisfied. They are not looking for the one time purchase customer, amazon appreciates customer loyalty and they will take care of them accordingly.

In the past year I have lost to much money to continue.  Their return policy sucks.  I had a buyer that got a phone charger. Buyer emailed me the day after they got the item and said it didn't work and opened a return.  Ebay makes you accept the return so I had no choice but to agree.  I sent the buyer an email along with the ebay policy for returns and one of those stipulations is that the item must be returned in original packaging,  Item was sold with free shipping packaged in a box along with packing materials.  Buyer did return item in an envelope.  Item was working fine has charged my phone 3 times now.  Item was received on time in working condition,  Ebay states ""Not covered
Buyer remorse or any reason other than not receiving an item or receiving an item that isnt as described in the listing (see the sellers return policy for return options).
Items damaged during pick-up or shipping or not delivered when the buyer arranges pick-up or shipping of the item (for instance, the buyer arranges freight).

I have a no return policy which I know doesn't mean anything to ebay, but as stated buyer received the item in working condition but claimed it did not work.  Once I received the item back I called ebay asking them about their return policy,  I told them that the item was in working condition and did not meet their requirements for a refund.  Of course the only way to know that the item was working was to have buyer return the item to me.  Ebay told me that even though the buyer returned the item me, lied about the reason they were returning the item I would have to refund the entire amount plus the return shipping.  I asked ebay if I could deduct the return shipping and was told that the buyer would have to approve that and if they didn't I would have to refund the entire sale plus lose money I had to pay to have the buyer return a working item. They said  I could appeal but they could not guarantee an outcome in my favor.  So in other words you are screwed.  So now I am stuck with a working item that I would have to sale as used, am out the amount of the item, shipping to the buyer and shipping back to me for the refund.  

The return policy should state that a buyer for any reason can return any item at any time no matter the  condition and the seller will be made to accept the return and refund any and all money to the buyer.  Why would anyone want to sell on ebay anymore.  Best thing to do is buy on ebay, use the item until you don't want it anymore and return it to get your money back.  I don't have any use for ebay anymore and will not be selling on their site again.  I am tired of losing money!!!",1,“Ebay unfair to sellers” 
379,"Do NOT buy into the hype of selling internationally on eBay. You know where they tell you they make it easy for you to sell worldwide. It's easy because it's a ripoff. I have sold several items on eBay throughout the years and decided to try selling internationally for a certain item I had that I thought might do well worldwide. I was right and the item was purchased by someone in New Zealand. eBay claims that they make selling internationally easy, all the seller has to do is send it to a shipping house in KY and they will do the rest for you. I did that, I sent my item to KY, where it was received on March 30th. The customs paperwork etc. was done and it was then sent to New Zealand, where it is now being held in customs. The problem, eBay is also holding my money, until it's actually delivered to the buyer. Now some may think that sounds reasonable, however, my job, my ""duty"" was to get it to KY, not to New Zealand. eBay accepted the responsibility to get it to New Zealand, so once it got to KY, it should no longer have been on me. If they filled out the customs paperwork wrong, or they replaced my item with a brick, that's on them, not on me. However, if the item sits in customs because paperwork was filled out wrong, I don't get paid until it's corrected and delivered. However, eBay has already invoiced me for their share of the sale and there is a possibility that it will come out of my account before I even get paid. (They automatically bill through your PayPal account). I called eBay and went through the above with the representative, who tried to override the system and could not. I then asked her for a supervisor. The supervisor could not, or would not, override the system either. I then asked it to be escalated above that supervisor and again that person said the same thing. The first girl told me that I was not the only person to complain about this. I am seriously thinking about looking into a class action suit. I fulfilled my end of the deal by getting it to KY and I left it in eBay's hands. What happened after it left KY, should be on them, not me and I should be getting paid for doing what I was supposed to do. Word to the wise, DO NOT SELL INTERNATIONALLY on eBay!!!  It's basically a ripoff unless you are willing to put your item and money in someone else's hands and wait forever to get paid.",1,“DO NOT SELL INTERNATIONALLY on eBay!!!”

I feel like a battered wife who continually returns to her abusive husband because he's convinced her he's the only one who will ever love her. Or a hostage whose dependence on her kidnapper starts to confusingly feel like love. Every year in the Spring they announce their ""improvements"" which inevitably includes higher fees, lower discounts and smaller hoops with bigger flames to jump through in order to keep the great rewards I've already earned. They're so busy trying to compete with Amazon they have NO IDEA who their sellers are anymore. They forget that it was THE SMALL BUSINESSES who BUILT EBAY and individual people who sell UNIQUE AND INTERESTING ITEMS THAT YOU CANNOT FIND ON PLACES LIKE AMAZON. And still even though I've spent so much precious time and energy sourcing beautiful items and present impeccable listings I don't get enough traffic because i'm still somehow forced to compete with Chinese sweatshop junk and to jump through these ridiculous hoops that no small seller of unique items should have to jump through in order to get any traffic at all. HAVING TO ACCEPT RETURNS OF ANTIQUE AND VINTAGE JEWELRY AND CLOTHES WITHIN THIRTY DAYS? ARE YOU KIDDING? I should be able to charge a rental fee. And now this year they've announced they're not only INCREASING the seller standards for top rated sellers but DECREASING the discount! Why should I bother? Here's what I think: They should separate eBay into two factions -eBay USED / and eBay NEW (eBazon) eBay USED would operate like the traditional glorious eBay of long ago: Powerseller/ No powerseller. Lower the fees, give everyone an level playing ground and let the quality of the listings and the product speak for itself. Sellers who throw their junk on the floor and take crappy photos will get the consequent lack of sales and they'll either learn to raise the bar for themselves or stick to selling off their lawn. The eBay NEW can do what it does to compete with Amazon and let the big box sellers duke it out over the margins of their cheap overseas chotchkies.

Now it takes  you to all your products. I have over 2500 ads. They now leave as they don't see the item. This cut my sales in half

You don't build brand loyalty With this.  They want the credit or brand to be eBay. This hurt sales as well.

423,"First off, I would like to say that I've been a member of eBay as a seller and buyer since 2006 (11 years ago from when I'm writing this), and I have had no prior offenses or strikes against my account until this past week. I've also had hundreds of positive ratings with a 100% positive feedback. I listed an item in an incorrect category when trying to get the selling listing together, eBay sent me a message and immediately restricted my account indefinitely without warning. I called customer support and the agent on the phone was SO RUDE to me and was telling me all these other ways he would restrict my account for trying to lift the permanent ban on my account for listing items. The fees are also 13-15% of your sales so it's not worth your time to even list on there. There are so many other selling platforms that have much better customer service than this. eBay doesn't even have a strike policy, you screw up once and you're completely cut off. For clothing, shoes, and accessories, use Poshmark, StockX, and GOAT. They are way better than eBay. I'm gladly taking my business elsewhere. After being with them 11 years, I get treated like a doormat. Horrible customer service.",1,“HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE + UNREASONABLE FEES. TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE!” 
424,"Pathetic  Experince !

We ordered a folding wardrobe and Mixer from Ebay worth 5000/- !

First they delivered the said products very late and then they delivered the faulty products and refused to make any refund.

Huge Disappointment as a customer.

Later, when we gave bad rating on Ebay website, then we got a call from Vendor asking to change the rating and make it positive. And in return they asked to give us a gift voucher worth 500/-.

425,"After reading the reviews I see that many people have the same issue I have. I went to purchase a bunch of items for my Exhibitor role for the Calgary Comic Expo and I chose which account the money **Should** come out of. I placed the order and then I opened my email to a bunch of NSF's so I paniced and went into the account they tried taking the funds from and it wasn't the account I selected. I now have negative(-)$1,600.00 in the account I didn't intent on using and PayPal then went into the appropriate account and took the funds. So now I'm out 1,600 and I have about $150.00 worth of product coming to me. I then in a panic called PayPal and their representatives were unprofessional and made it seem like this happens all the time and said they will provide me with a Bank Letter to resolve the issue. I had to call them three(3) times to get a proper response... I then brought the letter to the bank and the bank then said its not their issue as they're not the ones that caused these so they said PAYPAL should cover this. Basically Im stuck with a $1,600 bill that PayPal caused with their crappy system that I now have to pay back or else my credit goes down the drain. thanks for ruining a struggling mans life.",1,“Wont help when their system error”

In the mean time I do not have the product for over a month and I have paid for that transaction using Paypal who will charge me late payment if I do not make a payment to them for the un-received/lost item. What a painful experience. I wish I had stuck to Amazon. I had a broken item from amazon recently, and within a day the product was picked up and new one delivered at my door step.

Yes, there is pics there on my ebay selling page of no damage and 2 that ain't my CPU google i5 cpus and you will see stamps on all of them they did and you're saying he won because he opened the case I rang first and you told me to wait.

435,"As a buyer, I've received broken items, items with holes and items that were completely different than their descriptions. I've waited 2 months to receive items from China just for them to fall apart within minutes of receiving them. When returning an item, I've been charged a ""restocking fee"" by the seller for an item that was never used and still in original packaging and could be resold at full retail price. Then eBay auto drafted money out of my PayPal account without my knowledge or approval for the shipping label to return the item, costing me almost as much to just have kept the item. Had I known all this I probably would have just kept the item. As a seller, I've listed and sold an item, then issued a partial refund to the buyer but was still invoiced by eBay for 10% of the initial listing price, without the refund. That's because eBay takes 10% of everything you sell. You can just think of that like for every $80 you sell, you're giving up an $8 item to eBay for free. As if that's not enough, today I received an invoice that was too high to be 10% of the total cost of the items I had sold, so I contacted their ""do not care"" department and spoke with a woman who told me they are now charging their beastly 10% on the ""total value"" meaning you're paying them 10% of what it costs to ship the item as well. Now that $8 item you're giving away to the money lords of eBay for $80 worth of sales is a $10 loss because you pay 10% of shipping cost, plus 10% of the item's cost. I tried to reason with this woman explaining that in all my listings, I select the option to charge the actual cost of shipping to the buyer. I do not make any profit on shipping, why should I have to pay eBay 10% of it? Did they somehow assist with picking up my boxes? She told me they were doing this now to entice more sellers to offer free shipping. I told her they were enticing more sellers to sell elsewhere if they want to have anything left over as profit.

She then accused me of poking holes on the purse!!! And denying It's her purse! I send her a photo of the datecode to prove that it is definitely her purse. And then she started accusing me of burning the bottom of the bag! I told her, i was never a smoker and why would i ruined a bag i paid almost a grand for?

Immediately it was noticed that the laptop is saying to service battery. Apparently the battery has never had a replacement since it was new in 2011.

I purchased t the keyboard on September 16, 2016, got it a week later. I used it twice while traveling, it worked fine.  Third time, on a long flight from London, it stopped working.  Once in my office, I replaced the cable that connects the keyboard to the PC for charging and communication, the keyboard was still bad.

I wrote the seller through eBay messaging the following: 
-    Hello, I purchased the keyboard late September.  I used it three times on the plane. Last week traveling from London to ls Angeles the keyboard stopped working. Once in my office, l replaced the cable but it did not fix it. I connected it my tablet to my office keyboard. I was able to use my tablet. The keyboard is dead. Please advice of I have it fixed or replaced.

Two days later I got this response form the Chinese seller newmango: 
-   Dear buyer Thanks for your contact.  Sorry for any inconvenience caused. for this case, can we issue refund 2USD for you as compensation to fix the issue? looking forwards for your reply  I believe you are a good buyer, will contact me back, then solve the issue smoothly.   best regards

So the seller with broken English politely tried to shaft me. Instead of offering refund or honor their warranty, they offered me $2 to go away.  Very smart and very sleek!

I responded to them as follow: 
-   If you guys want to do business with Americans; you have to honor the warranty. This keyboard has 6 month warranty, so either replace it or refund my money. otherwise i will give you bad review on the internet

They responded with: 
-    ok, we will resend you a new one today

These Chinese sellers believe that Americans are fools.  Just like their government taking advantage of our stupid politicians to receive favorite trade agreements and sell us their products but we cannot sell them our products. 

You need to push back and be less kind to these people because that is the only language they understand. DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.

I got a response from eBay within 24 hours telling me that my case has been closed by eBay in the seller's favour because the seller asked eBay for help. eBay also removed my negative feedback to make sure more buyers can fall into the same trap. I called PayPal out of desperation, they were very willing to open the case in their disputes centre and look into the matter.

I have received two defective items and one that does not fit, and I am having a heck of a time getting my money refunded on all of these. One is a steam vacuum cleaner that broke the third time I used it. The seller said they wouldn't refund my money; that since I'd had it for four months I had to go through the warranty process. In doing this I found out that this vacuum is from 2010, is no longer manufactured, and almost no service center services it anymore. I found one that does service this model and took the vacuum to them; they are to get back to me on repair price, but the vacuum is still under warranty so the warranty may take care of it. My preference was just to get my money refunded and I am going through this process under duress by the seller. The other item is a purse from China that arrived with a broken zipper. The seller made me take a photo of the zipper and then dunned me to change my negative to a positive review. Another Chinese seller whose product never arrived also has dunned me to change a negative to a positive review. Finally, I ordered a leather vest described as being a size 8 ""small to medium."" When it arrived it turned out to be more like a size 4. But the seller refuses to take the vest back and eBay is siding with the seller because the designation ""8"" appears on the label. But the vest is NOT as described. It is made for a child or a small teenager and I'm a grown woman who have to hold my arms up and then lower the vest onto them to put it on. In all three cases any legitimate store would have accepted the item back and refunded my money.

The cost of the transport from the USA to Thailand were clear $10, 95.
In case Ebay will not admit this kind of abuse your place is clearly between the abusing parties!

Import duties over-charged with 127%

I consider the extraction of $25.- as theft as it has nothing to do with the by Ebay mentioned obligation to pay import duties to the Government

This article of Change.org is circulating on the Internet and explains clearly the problem!

Ebay's Global Shipping Programs' only use is to illegally gouge and steal money from non-US customers. Any time an American Ebay retailer sells an item to someone outside the USA, some company called Pitney Bowes blindly adds a %15 charge to the item's final value, on top of the sellers shipping and handling fees, for no apparent reason. The buyer has no option to opt out of this bogus service. These unfair and unjust fees are forced on the buyer illegally. It's nothing but a scam and Canadians are tired of being taken advantage of!! 
It has nothing to do with shipping or handling. We know this because the seller takes the item to a USPS Post Office, the same as they always did. There is no way USPS would know to forward this particular piece of mail to some third party handler, as opposed to any other piece of mail. They simply deliver this item as they do any other item, for the normal rate. As well, this has nothing to do with taxes or duties. Pitney Bowes just blindly adds a fee to any item's final price, regardless of the item's tax eligibility. In many cases, there is NO TAX to be charged on a particular parcel, however this does not seem to make any difference. 
Ebay and Paypal. Shame on you for allowing PITNEY BOWES to money-grab your customers. This should be illegal, but unfortunately we will have to sue Ebay, Paypal and Pitney Bowes for fraud in a class-action lawsuit. It is horrendous that a company allows a third party to steal from their customers like this.",1,“SCAMMERS AND THIEFS!”

So I think they remove negative feedback to increase their positive standings, and this should not be happening.",1,“had a bad experience” 
489,"Ebay just doesn't seem to get how to compete in today's market.  Whether it's buying or selling you're bound to get screwed by these jackoffs.  
It started when they eliminated the option for sellers to leave negative feedback about buyers- now sellers are leaving positive feedback about negative experiences with buyers because that is the only way they can warn other sellers.  Now if you have an issue with a buyer you can ""report"" them, which never even yields a response from ebay.  Also, as a seller they force you to offer a return policy, which is understandable but it doesn't really matter what your return policy is or how long the buyer takes to want to return something, ebay always sides with the buyer.  With used items, forcing a 30 day return policy is ridiculous.  If something was damaged when you received it would you wait 30 days to complain?  NO.  It's leaving the door open for people who know how to scam the system.  Furthermore some things are time sensitive- aka if I have a 30 day return policy on a prom dress, the buyer can wear it then return it.  Poshmark has a 3 day policy, this is great; they receive it and inspect it and that's that.
Now if you're buying on ebay and aren't familiar with it, you'll be had by the overflowing amount of knockoffs and fakes.  Sure, most people know the stuff from China is fake and never the proper size, color, quality as the image implies, but now these foreign sellers have gotten smarter and are listing these items as ""ships from US"" when they really don't.  If you check the feedback, they may have 98-99% feedback but when you read the reviews the amount of negative comments is astonishing.  Regardless of how many items a seller sells, how many reports that an item is fake or that buyers are unhappy with a seller need to be made before ebay eliminates that seller?  Who knows? But I've seen sellers with literally thousands of negative feedback.  It is a true testament of ebay's character that they knowingly allow these shady, illegal knockoff sellers to continue on ebay, and we the good sellers pay the price.  
I've been a member since 1999.  My feedback is 100%.  Does ebay care?  Not in the slightest, they'll side with a buyer who has a string of shady feedback.
Now let's talk about payment...  What other site let's you buy something but not have to pay for it right away?  You can add it to your cart on other sites, but until it's paid for, somebody else can actually pay for it and swipe it out from under you.  Not on ebay.  Once somebody commits to buy that item just sits there waiting for payment.  And if the payment isn't made after so many days, instead of being able to relist it, you have to open a case and wait another week to see if the person is going to pay.  You used to be able to sort of protect yourself from this as a seller by blocking new buyers but now ebay says that's discriminatory towards new buyers who need to build up feedback.  You can block an individual member, but they have to screw you over before you know to add them to your list!  
Also, ebay tries to force it's members to ship items same or next day.  While I appreciate this service, you're saying if my buyer dinks around and waits 7 days to pay for an item that I have to rush to the PO to get it out to them- DUMB!  Clearly they didn't want it that fast or they would have paid right away.
In no way is this a comprehensive list of issues you're sure to incur with ebay, but it's a good warning to stay away if you're an honest person whether you plan to sell or buy!",1,“STAY FAR AWAY”

Seller refused to accept the return unless I removed my negative feedback. I told him I will change it to neutral if he accepts it, but based on above reasons listed, I refuse to say I was satisfied.

Ebay then went behind my back, without contacting me first, and removed my rating. Seller then told me he called Ebay and simply asked them to remove it and they did.

Seller has 1500 positive reviews, 1 neutral, 0 negative. The reason it's so perfect is because the seller will refuse to help/bribe you over reviews, and Ebay sided with seller on removing my review without even asking. Essentially, their rating system is 100% rigged.

Item also took 5 weeks to ship using the global shipping program and costed me $100, however my return shipping was 5 days for non-express, meaning they could have shipped it direct in far less time for less price ($80).

-I had no negative ratings on my account.
-I was selling some of my music software that I no longer use.
-They asked me the other day for my photo ID, my bank statements, & receipts for my purchases. Everything went smoothly & I proved to them I am legit.
My customer satisfaction ratings were just about perfect. Only one neutral rating and ZERO negative ratings. But *dozens* of positive reviews.
-A portion of my proceeds went to charity. If I was really a risk, I think I would be taking the money all to myself, no? My account was built on a good cause & my customers has nothing but good things to say about me & the service I provided to them.

Now they want me to pay them $145 in seller fees, even though I can no longer sell anything. Yet they want me to compensate them.

I called the seller and he said again it was rust free, had the correct engine and would run with just a little work, but the whole interior was trashed & it had no brakes no brakes.

Ebay's customer service and resolution center employees are lack of competent, knowledge, analytical skills, professional care, due diligence, and have no clues how to handle/solve problems.

Here is a scenario of an existing problem: when a buyer makes an accusation about a product; logically, that individual needs to have a proof or some types of evidence to support the accusation.

Based on the scenario above, Ebay's model of solving problems between buyers and sellers are as follows:

By not requiring evidence from buyer, ignoring the facts, information, and other relevant details that relates to the accusation, Ebay creates unfair treatment and bias against the seller.

'Doing business with Ebay is unpleasant and costly for seller's business. Given Ebay employees lack of competence, professional care and due diligence, it's very difficult to communicate with and receive fair treatment.

I had a horrible experience with the eBay seller ""the wheel mall"" . I ordered the 4 wheels on May 16th. The arrival of the items were suppose to be on May 27th. I received an email confirmation stating that the items will be received on May 27th.  I waited for a tracking number but I didn't receive one. I contacted the seller on May 27th to confirm the items were shipped, they told me ""YES"" the items aren on your way but it was lie, acording to UPS records the wheel mall shipped my items on may 27th right after I called them. The items were delivered on June 3rd 3 weeks after I ordered them. I personally think this was not a good customer experience. That is not the way to treat a customer. I paid $167.00 for 5 day shipping. And I didn't get the items until 3 weeks later. I am a good eBay buyer and a responsible customer. The communication from the seller was poor. The service was not up to the standard of eBay. I should at least be refunded shipping of the product. Then I submitted a review for the seller and eBay removed my review from the sellers page. I Understand eBay is trying to protect the sellers, but who protects the buyers???

Also the fact that as a seller i cannot leave a buyer negative or neutral feedback which has left me open to being blackmailed by buyers saying if i don't give them their money back (because they aren't satisfied even though it is exactly as described) and let them keep the item they will leave me negative feedback and they can do this knowing that there is nothing i can do about their rude behavior, so they have me backed against a wall. Example i sell beads online the person who recieved my beads was no satisfied with the amount they received and even though it was stated on the auction how many they get, they told me if i didn't send them more beads that i was going to recieve negative feedback, so what am i suppose to do? I either have to send more or get bad feedback. Also if someone decides not to pay at all still i cannot leave the negative feedback. So they get away with costing me business and there is nothing i can do but report them but no one see's that. I think if these buyers knew their ratings could be ruined by being rude or black mailing or by not paying at all maybe they would be a little bit more considerate.

I tried selling my $700 camera on eBay a few days ago. Yesterday, I received an email from eBay saying my item was ""sold"" and to ship the item. I reviewed the official looking email, and sent a request for payment. I then received an email 10 minutes later saying the item was paid for.  Long story short, after shipping my camera, I called eBay and found out the email was fake.  I got my camera back, was refunded the shipping cost, and the user was reported.  

I re-listed my item to try again. 

Today, I received another email from eBay stating that my item was SOLD. This time, I paid closer attention and did nothing until I saw payment was received in my PayPal.  I sent the request for money, and this time something else happened...

I not only received a fake email, branded at being from PayPal saying that they received payment (even though my PayPal account reflected no such activity), but I was also overwhelmed with text messages from a phone number claiming to be the ""buyer"" begging me to ship the package saying ""I paid, send me my camera.""  After asking how they got my number and mentioning to them that their account was being reported and they were being blocked, they began blowing up my phone with pleads to send them the camera. 

All in all, this is very, very frightening and disappointing knowing that such a well-known company such as eBay, has such poor security on their site. My personal information was released to these ""buyers"" and I was harassed by an unknown number. On top of that, my $700 camera was almost lost and sent to a scammer because of accounts being hacked and fake emails being sent to good people trying to sell their precious items.

But last time I remember they changed a lot and I spend almost 1 hour to just find out that I can buy from them only after PayPal check info about me, which took 1 month. So I just left that hell for a user. And now I was trying to buy just 1 package of $#*!ing earplugs. Because I can't buy them on ali, I spend like 30 $#*!ing minutes trying to buy them on EBay. Why? It's unexplainable because what was happeninbg in that 30 minutes nobody can understand including me. You reeealy have to check usability of your site because it sucks a lot.

606,Bad company to work with!! Contacting eBay is unless they are a nightmare and very poor skill on the phone. Gutted I ever set up my account with them.,1,“Very poor company” 
607,"A customer purchased a ""high value"" item from my eBay page ($750.00 or more). It was shipped with insurance for the declared value of the purchase price. Item allegedly arrived damaged. Buyer received the item at a FedEx facility, removed it from the shipping carton and discarded the carton. He placed the large, 50lb item in his car and drove 45 miles to his home. He removed the item from the internal packing and messaged me to inform me that the item was damaged. I apologized for the inconvenience and proceeded to submit the shipping insurance claim using the documentation/images of the damaged item provided by the buyer. Obviously, I am at the mercy of the buyer providing the required information for the claim submission, or the lack thereof in this case. Insurance claims for shipping always require pictures of the outer package, the inner packing materials and of course the damaged item. Buyer claimed to notice slight damage to the outer shipping carton while he was at the FedEx facility where it was received, indicating that it had been dropped. However, he said nothing to facility personnel, and discarded the box. And later apologized for not noting the damage while he was there (if in fact there was damage). So, no outer carton pictures were provided. Consequently, the FedEx claim was denied for lack of evidence of a damaged shipping carton. So now, guess what? Yep! The seller has two options. Pay for the repairs to the item, (which declared insurance coverage would have sufficed), or accept a return and refund the buyer for the full purchase amount, along with return shipping as per all the information above. ($1100.00 USD total) Item was declared ""Not As Described"", as the item arrived damaged, at no fault of mine. The buyer had a fiduciary responsibility and HE failed, not me! The fault here lies on the buyer for not disclosing adequate information to produce a positive outcome to the insurance claim. Numerous messages were sent back and forth to eBay customer service stating that the buyer's negligence to produce adequate information resulted in the insurance claim denial. I thought, ""Yeah man, I got this thing beat!"" NOT! I submitted two written signed statements from the postal business center on their letterhead, where the item was shipped from. One stating that the package met required specifications for shipping, the other stating basically that the buyer did everything wrong and the seller did everything right. There was absolutely no swaying the decision of customer service to rule in my favor, even when creating reasonable doubt that the item was damaged prior to receipt (during shipping) as the buyer did not report any damage to the carton to FedEx, while he was still at the facility, which he had every opportunity to do so. The buyer failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the damage in fact did occur during shipping, hence the claim denial. I was ultimately held liable for the cost of repairs to the item which amounted to $800.00 USD. I guess I got lucky, as the buyer agreed to accept a partial refund for the cost of the repairs, The return shipping would have been $100.00 and refund of the $999.00 purchase price
         Representation on the seller's side of eBay's bargaining table is non-existent in all ""Request To Return"" cases. The seller is always the bad guy no matter what and has absolutely no say in the ruling. NONE! ALL seller testimony was blatantly disregarded. If a case is opened against a seller by a buyer, don't waste your time fighting it. It won't do you any good. YOU WILL NOT WIN! 
         In a recent email I asked eBay's customer service, ""You obviously have the buyer protection program. Where do your seller protections lie?"" She said, ""The seller protection is the shipping insurance that you purchase."" Well, what good is that if the buyer doesn't provide adequate information to produce a positive outcome to a claim? And neglects to report shipping damage to a facility where he received the item? I exercised that protection.  I was told by customer service that eBay has limited resources to provide a ruling on a case and shipping insurance was not one of those resources. WHAT? Their main limited resource is their narrow little minds!
         As a result of this experience, I am no longer an eBay user, and neither is my wife, as she had a similar ""not as described"" experience. So, if you decide to become an eBay seller, this is what you can expect. Absolutely ZERO seller representation under the buyer protection program. Make your decision wisely. You have been warned!!!!!!!!",1,"“""Buyer Always Wins""” "

627,"As a seller or a buyer, you will sometimes end up with problems. And then you can try and use Ebay's automated system, but frankly it usually fails miserably. Calling and talking to customer service is a very long operation, and is hit or miss, and you can spend many hours doing this. On one item I bought I ended up calling a total of six times, and several times I was told one thing by one person, and a completely opposite thing by the next. Good information was rare. The people in the Philippines are much better than they used to be, but it's still common to get a really bad one. You have to be very persistent and find a good person which is getting harder and harder. -
- Also, many items on Ebay are fakes. There are websites that help you figure out if what you are buying is a fake. And Ebay sells dangerous, illegal things. Earlier this week I had them take down an auction for an abortion drug, Mifepristone. Many illegal prescription drugs are for sale, although it varies greatly over time, as they do take some of them down. -
-I just got them to take down about 100 auctions for an antibiotic that's by prescription only, but another one that's even stronger and more dangerous, even after three phone calls, they've not taken down over 50 auctions for it. The FDA confirmed it was illegal.-
-Recently there were F-14 Tomcat military aircraft parts, and other apparently stolen military hardware. After reporting it, it's all still there. Calling the Dept. of Defense it was very hard to get someone to help but they finally looked at it and agreed ""It's illegal"". You can see the NSN numbers on a lot of these items, and they're not supposed to be sold to the public.- Attempting to report these things to US customs, the FDA, the FTC, FBI cyber crimes, and DHS, has met with utter failure after numerous tries since 2002. Attempting to get legislation through Congress has met with failure.
-Magic the Gathering cards, a one billion dollar a year worldwide industry, many of the cards coming in from China are all fake. I've bought many of them, sent them to PSA and Beckett, all fake. Ebay still allows those sellers to sell. Also, reported dozens of auctions with fake fossils from China, Ebay took them all down, a week later they were all back up again by the same sellers. Rinse, repeat, called them several times, they took them down, they came right back. To this day they're all still there for sale, fake fossils from China. -I'm not an unhappy Ebay user, I'm a seller with a good rating.",1,“Customer service can be very bad”

I won't buy anything from them again.",1,“Returns are a hassle”

One day, I was looking for something very specific and the best deal I could find was in this forbidden place I only dared to enter. With my walls up, I decided to ever so delicately step foot into it and maybe I could get in and out quickly without waking up the dragon. Well I was wrong, so wrong... All of the nightmares I've had about Ebay came true..so vividly I have a hard time believe it actually happened. I'd honestly rather overpay than buy anything through Ebay ever again.

This is the seller I would like to warn you about: thejocur. 

I never received my items, both this seller and Ebay has done NOTHING to help me. ZERO. Their claims of buyer protection guaranteed is illegal and should be taken down before it puts them in deeper waters. I paid the full amount for my item, I never received it. I was understanding of the possible glitches or delays that occur with certain shipping carriers. I went above and beyond what I could do, I talked to the shipping carrier headquarters, opened a criminal investigation with them, talked to the local carrier and the driver who had supposedly delivered the packages. I even called the local police and their central division, and also talked with a police detective. All of this was ONGOING/MID-INVESTIGATION and Ebay chose to close this case within 15 minutes..obviously Ebay doesn't give 2 cents about the buyers. To make matters worse, the seller had horrible business manners and extremely poor communication skills. He/she was attempting to start some kind of blame game and pushing away all responsibility like a 5 year old getting caught selling bad lemonade. I would have expected a lot more from someone who has been doing business on Ebay for 18 years. It is a fact that I never received my item, and the seller had no professionalism and extremely poor communication skills during this matter (evidenced in messages). Additionally, it was 100% dishonest practice to be charged for something I never received. I wanted to express these FACTS in a negative feedback, but guess what? Ebay removed it not even after 1 minute. I wrote no profanity, and merely stated the aforementioned TRUE facts to warn others about the seller. Now what does that tell you? I can safely say, this will be the first and last time I will ever be doing business with Ebay.

633,"Has anyone been following ALL THE RECENT POLICY CHANGES AT EBAY?

IN THE LAST WEEK THIS IS 2 THINGS I ENCOUNTERED:

1) FAKE SALE!

UPON SINGING INTO EBAY, THERE WAS A PRESIDENTS DAY SALE AD THAT FEATURED PUMA BRAND SHOES AT 50% OFF! I LIKED THE PAIR IN THE IMAGE SO I FOLLOWED TO THE ITEM PAGE WHICH WAS ACTUALLY THE PUMA INC EBAY STORE.

THERE THE SHOES WERE MARKED AT $35 WHICH W-A-S HALF OFF THE $70 DOLLAR ORIGINAL PRICE....

HOWEVER THERE WERE SIZES AND STYLES. WHEN YOU SELECTED THE STYLE THAT WAS AD FEATURED....SURPRISE THE CHECKOUT PRICE WAS N-O-T 50% OFF BUT THE ORIGINAL $70.

THERE WAS NO ADJUSTMENT AT REGISTER EITHER SO I BACKED OUT AND FILED AN ITEM REPORT WHICH WENT NOWHERE BECAUSE EBAY COULD CARE LESS ABOUT AN ACTUAL CONSUMER IN THE LIGHT OF AN ENTITY THAT GENERATES A FEW THOUSAND FEES FOR THEM YEARLY.

IS THIS FAIR? NO. CONSUMER LAWS ARE INTACT AND SHOULD COVER CYBER COMMERCE WITHIN THE AMERICAN BORDERS ELECTRONIC OR NOT.

2) I WAS SHOPPING FOR CELL PHONES AND HAPPEN TO LIKE AND RETAIN MY OLDER SAMSUNG MODEL SLIDER PHONE. I ALSO KEEP A BACKUP JUST IN CASE AND RECENTLY HAD TO RESORT TO MY BACKUP AND ALTHOUGH IT WAS LIKE NEW, THESE THINGS TEND TO PLAY OUT AT BAD TIMES SO I WANTED TO GET A BACKUP ASAP.

I FOUND ONE AND IT WAS BUNDLED WITH ANOTHER SAMSUNG PHONE OF A DIFFERENT MODEL A GENERATION OR SO NEWER. THE STARTING BID PRICE WAS SET AT $20. I SENT A MESSAGE TO THE SELLER TO CONFIRM THESE WERE ATT&T USEABLE PHONES AND WAS CONFIRMED. 

SALE END WAS A WEEK AWAY SO I WAITED UNTIL CLOSER TO END TO BID. I FORGOT TO BOOKMARK THE ITEM BUT DECIDED I COULD ACCESS IT VIA MY MESSAGE BOX AND DID SO. IN MY MESSAGE BOX THE STARTING BID WAS STILL A $20 ITEM.

WHEN I WENT TO THE PAGE IT WAS DOUBLED......AND I FIGURED A BIDDING WAR WAS GOING AND WAS ABOUT TO FORGO THE THING WHEN I NOTICED THE SHIPPING HAD DOUBLED TOO! 

SO I LOOK THE AD OVER AND THERE WERE N-O BIDDERS! SOMEHOW THE SELLER WAS ALLOWED TO COMPLETELY ALTER THE AD ANYWAY HE PLEASED TO CHEAT A BUYER OUT OF BIDDING.

EBAY AFTER NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS DID NOTHING. 

THEN WE GET TO FEEDBACK.....DID YOU KNOW YOU CANNOT FEEDBACK EBAY? TWITTER AND EVERYONE ELSE ALL HAVE A SITE FEEDBACK TAB/OPTION AND THIS ALLOWS FOR SUGGESTIONS AS WELL AS JUST COMPLAINTS. EBAY HAS DECIDED IT SIMPLY DOESNT CARE ABOUT US SO WHY SHOULD WE CARE ABOUT THEM?

CUSTOMER SERVICE ONLY IS FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE AND SELLERS GET A BETTER ACCESS AND SOMETIMES ITS JUST STUPID. 

LAST YEAR I BOUGHT A $5 ITEM AND GOT AN EMAIL A FEW DAYS AFTER PAYING IT HAD SHIPPED....WITH A DELIVERY DATE OF SOME 2 MONTHS LATER. WHAT?

I CONTACTED THE SELLER WHO AFFIRMED TO ME THE ITEM INDEED HAD SHIPPED. SO I FIGURED THE TIME ESTIMATE WAS A COMPUTER THING AND NONREALISTIC......UNTIL LIKE WEEK 5 AND NO ITEM. PAYPAL ONLY ALLOWS REFUNDS UP TO LIKE 45 DAYS AND 2 MONTHS WAS BEYOND THAT SO I ATTEMPTED TO CONFIRM A DELIVERY TIME AND GOT NONE...

SO I CONTACTED PAYPAL AND CANCELLED THE SALE. I BEING THE HONEST PERSON I AM, IF THE ITEM ARRIVED WOULD HAVE CONTACTED AND PAYPALLED VIA EMAIL. THAT WAS MUTE BECAUSE THE ITEM NEVER CAME. 

SO AFTER 4 MONTHS I REALIZED BY MESSAGE FROM EBAY I HAD NOT LEFT A FEEDBACK...SO I DID>  A NEGATIVE ONE, AND OMG DID THIS GUY FLIP. BUT I NEVER GOT THE ITEM. HE ATTEMPTED AN EBAY DISPUTE WHICH IS THE NEXT NIGHTMARE....

IT SEEMS SELLERS CAN DISPUTE VIA EBAY WHILE THE REST OF US ARE RELEGATED TO PAYPAL ONLY. IT TOOK SEVERAL ATTEMPTS, BUT FINALLY AFTER BASICALLY TRYING TO PUSH ME INTO REVERSING MY FFEDBACK (WHICH I DIDNT KNOW WAS POSSIBLE), EBAY REALIZED THAT N-O ITEM WAS SENT OR RECEIVED. 

EBAY TODAY IS SIMPLY NOT A TRUSTWORTHY WEBSITE AND WE ALL MUST ACT ACCORDINGLY TO THIS. IT IS HOWEVER A NECCESSARY EVIL. 

SHOP THERE WITH A GRAIN OF SALT IN EVERYTHING, AND AVOID VEHICLE PURCHASES VIA EBAY LIKE THE PLAGUE! ITS ALL SCAMS AND EBAY REFUSES TO GET INVOLVED. 

ALSO BEWARE OF FAKE SALES AND CHECKOUT PRICE ADJUSTMENTS AS WELL AS SHIPPING CHARGE PRICE JUMPING.

ALL items (a few Chanel earrings and bracelets, Chanel scarves, Chanel purse, Burberry scarves, t-shirts and other high brand clothes) are FAKE.  EBay suggested me to contact sellers and ask for reimbursement. I did. No result!
But I have to be fair and to say that every time I've called eBay every person I've spoken with was very polite. The only problem is that no one could help with my issue :)))!
Needless to say that besides sounds of dollars thrown away on eBay I stuck with all the crap I bought!",1,“Never buy on eBay!!!!!” 
637,"eBay continues to disappoint...  Back in eBay's early days they had a lot of problems and it seems all these years later they have come full circle with many of the same problems.

eBay formerly jumped on sellers with high shipping costs and who did not accurately describe their goods.  I just recently bought a new old stock stereo component from them.  It is a good example of how they let people mess with you.

First the item was described as new old stock which it is.  But the seller said everything worked but it did not.  The key here was the machine both plays and records but the seller did not test to see if it recorded yet posted it as working fine. So if you should buy make certain the seller answers any questions you have before you bid.

Another big turn off is shipping cost.  My item cost $25 to ship as it is heavy but I point out similar sellers are charging as much as $75 for economy shipping for it  which in some cases is 50% or more of the asking price.  This is wrong and should be addressed by eBay who could care less.

The next problem was the ass did not know how to pack my item.  Its was heavy yet loosely packed in the shipping box.  When it arrived the front was caved in.  I'm lucky that I can fix such things and managed to fix the damage caused by bad packaging.

Unfortunately this is a rather common problem.  Earlier in the year a clueless gal sold me an old bottle.  I asked her to carefully pack it but she used one wrap of the pimple sized bubble wrap then put in in a too large box.  It arrived in shards.  The gal not only lost her bottle but had to refund my shipping and purchase price which she did under threat of filing a claim against her.

If you get taken file a claim listing the item not as described in most cases eBay will give your money back even if the seller won't.  Some sellers try to ignore complaints but back when I sold on eBay I made certain my customers were treated the way I wanted to be treated.

eBay needs to get real with questionable dealers but there are good dealers there too.  I always check for two things before I bid one is their feedback.  If they have a problem and then diss the buyer I skip them regardless how good they look as bad attitude is a sign of a bad dealer.

I agree eBay customer service is nothing I don't understand why they have the agents since they are non responsive.  Even with this if you go through the steps and file a claim item not as received you will probably get a refund.

But then the bigger issue is do you want to waste your time trying to buy there when it might not be as described, might arrive damaged and you will only get BS when you try to talk to eBay customer service.",1,“I'll toss out some other eBay problems U might not expect”

639,"I sell about 430 items on eBay (zellajake), and will generate about $19,000 in fees for them in 2016. There is practically no seller protection. All buyers have 100% positive feedback, no matter their countenance or criminal intentions. As a seller, you literally cannot leave negative feedback for a buyer, which renders buyer feedback scores precisely worthless. Meanwhile, a buyer can leave negative feedback for a seller for absolutely no reason. Most of our negative feedback is derived from USPS failure to deliver, and the buyer is NOT even made to contact the seller to work out the issue. EBay customer support will say, ad verbatum "" the buyer is entitled to their opinion"".  So if you don't mind not having any control whatsoever over  your own feedback, and you don't have a problem with not being able to expose criminal and abhorrent buyers, eBay is your site. And now on to my current complaint. We collect and grow a lot of our own supply, and therefore, there is no ""product identifier"" information to give. As of Feb 28th, 32 of our ads are going to get booted off of eBays auctions. Really? $19,000 in revenues and you will simply pinch us off? Their reasoning is that it gives the seller better product recognition. Given eBay's revenues from our sales, I don't believe that we need this coerced assistance. How about eBay sticks to collecting the fees, and let us sellers do what we do best...sell. I am very actively seeking alternative sites like Amazon, Etsy, and Bonanza. I'll immediately set the 32 ads up on those sites, then expand to our other products after that. If you, eBay, aren't loyal, you aren't getting our hard-earned commisions. EBay is getting worse, and worse, and worse.",1,“New required product identifiers are a deal breaker.”

I called Ebay several times and 1st argued they should insist he not inconvenience me anymore over his fraudulent products, but then argued they should get the pills to see that he is a defrauding people. They refused but these ideas but said I had 30 days to return it, and was protected by buyer protection.  I was finally able to get to a printer when I find that the case was resolved in his favor.  AND MY FEED BACK WARNING TO OTHERS WAS REMOVED.  They lied to me about how many days I had to return it.  People are relying on that Coq10 to replace what's lost due to aging and/or statin drugs.  Ebay has chosen to help sellers defraud people.  I've spent a hrs on this already and now have to go on to a credit card fight.  Amazon has resolved issues in 1 short phone call.

After dealing with many many unethical and dishonest people with no support from customer service I began to use my ""Cancel Order"" option to avoid being screwed since I knew eBay would not protect me. I had a 99.3% positive feedback rating with the only negative feedback coming from a dishonest customer who got his money back and kept my item which eBay refused to address. I gave away merchandise just to avoid any defects on my seller rating. Without a prior warning or email to let me know what was happening I received a below standard rating for having a 3.5% defect rate as a result of cancelled orders. Ebay reduced my account to ashes taking away my listings and moving my listings to very far down on the search listings. When I tried to cancel my account after 7 very frustrating phone calls I was told that I couldn't cancel my account while it was below standard. So now I have an eBay account which does not sell anything but still charges me all of the fees and I am helpless to do anything. There is absolutely no protection for sellers!!!

644,"I won a DSLR camera and went to pay immediately. PayPal declined both of my cards multiple times and I've never had problems with payment outside of PayPal. I even paid through the guest PayPal successfully a few times, having made another purchase on Ebay recently. 

I called PayPal customer service to find out apparently I had an unverified account from when I boycotted them years ago for refusing to verify. I told them I had closed that SIX YEARS AGO and the one time I come back it's a problem.

They closed the account but I still had problems, so they recommended I request a PayPal invoice from the seller. The whole time this is happening I've been communicating with the seller and it's only been a few minutes. I request the invoice and tell them I have to go to a meeting and will be back within 4 hours. 4 hours later the first thing in my email box is a messaging asking if I was going to pay and threatening to repost. 

I told them to have some patience and hold on a second, they need to respond to my communication and send the invoice I requested before they jump to abrupt conclusions. My further messages were ignored and they cancelled and reposted the listing within FIVE MINUTES, only FOUR HOURS after I won. If you don't even give a buyer 24 hours to purchase the item you're a TERRIBLE SELLER. A flake that didn't really want to sell it!

So I left a negative feedback, reported the relisting to Ebay for false listing (he would not sell it, it was a ""fishhook"" as they call it). Then I posted a warning in the Ebay community. Username is cudenver. He had the nerve to request me alter the Feedback without communicating to resolve the situation whatsoever.

Meanwhile, I'm looking at various community  discussions and the top tags are ""scam"" and ""seller"", with buyers complaining about terrible things that happened to them and people in the community saying it's their fault! There was NO accountability and NO integrity in the group.

Then I get responses blaming me as well, and saying my post would be removed for ""shaming and naming"". Because warning people about a bad seller and giving them bad publicity as a consequence of their actions is not allowed. Within minutes of the discussion my voice in the conversation was cut off as the post was removed by a mod.

I thought it was a reputable place to shop and they stood behind their customers when things did not go as planned.  However, I found out the hard way that the money back guarantee that they speak of did now exist in my case and they took a hands off approach and only cared about themselves and making a dishonest dollar.  I purchased over $600.00 in Olive Garden Gift Cards for Christmas Gifts through eBay, only to find out that when the people   went to use the cards they were empty and had no value on them because they were sold on eBay by a vendor who had used a stolen credit card to purchase the cards for resale and when I spoke to the Olive Garden's Corporate Office, the issuer of the cards, they informed me that they had cancelled all the cards that had been purchased by this vendor through fraud.  When I went back to eBay regarding this bad transaction seeking their intervention and reimbursement for the money I had lost,  I was told by eBay, that they could not refund me any money because I purchased them using my bank funds and did not buy the cards using my Pay Pal account and so I was out of $600.00 hard earned dollars and they did not seem to have any sense of responsibility or care about it at all.  Since then I have learned that they do not screen their vendors well and continue to allow fraudulent items to be sold under their name.  The vendor is still listing items on eBay.",1,“Ebay does not stand behind it's customers.”

A buyer requested to return a coat for the reason of ""nothing wrong, just didn't like it."" It was stated in my listing that I don't do returns, so I denied the request for the reason of buyer's remorse. They proceeded to ship the item back to me outside of eBay anyways. I called eBay multiple times and was assured that since the error was the buyer's and the return case was closed that there was nothing they could do to possibly pull the funds from my account. I didn't need to return the coat to them, but I still got in touch with them to try. The buyer then sent me money out of the blue to overnight the coat to the other side of the country, but I refunded that money since I wasn't able to change the shipping address on PayPal. They then re-sent the money demanding that I ship to Canada and didn't understand why it couldn't be done through ebay's international shipping program. It was an e-check that would take a week to clear, so I told them that I'd have to wait for that. They were incredibly uncooperative and when I finally said I would ship, they went and filed a claim on PayPal that the coat was ""significantly not as described"" (which was a lie, as documented by their messages on eBay) and forced a full refund in their favor. The claim was closed within 24 hours. I spent the next 3 days on hold with eBay explaining the situation and was told that there was no way that the return should have happened because it was a case of buyer's remorse, but that eBay had no power and the refund was done by PayPal. I finally got through to PayPal and was told that this decision was absolutely final and in the buyer's favor because the item had been returned and in my possession, so it's automatically a refund for the buyer. They not only got a full refund, but also the original $15 I paid to ship AND the seller fees I had to pay eBay, since the return wasn't documented on eBay. I lost $40 in this situation and feel like nobody at eBay had any power to do anything and I just got lost in a mess of transfers. I would be on hold for a few hours and then finally get through to someone, explain my story all over again, and then get transferred to someone who had no idea what was happening but who couldn't transfer me back the other way, so I'd have to hang up and wait on hold again for a few hours to try again. I had spent a so much of my time being assured by eBay that I did nothing wrong and the buyer was messing up right and left, but then being told by PayPal that eBay has no power and was just ""giving me false hope.""

715,"Whoever told you that you can't get something for nothing flat out lied to you!  Don't think so?  Go buy anything on Ebay.  It won't matter the situation, you will get all your money back. Why?  Because the dumb $#*!s at Ebay think it's the buyers that make their world go around.  They haven't figured out yet that it's a 50/50 contribution between buyers and sellers.  If you've never sold anything on Ebay, spare yourself the heartache and flat out injustice and don't start. If you do decide to sell something, be prepared for practices that mirror the IRS.  If your buyer doesn't want the item you shipped them for ANY reason, you are paying to have it shipped back to you no matter what.  If you don't send them a prepaid label, Ebay will take it upon themselves to send one on your behalf. That's right. They will charge you for the return label.  Now you are out not only what you paid to ship it to them, you are also out what is costs to get it back from them.  Had enough yet? No? There's more.  What you will find is that you have no way to give a negative feedback to ANY buyer under ANY circumstance.  On the other hand, if you piss the buyer off whether it's valid or not, you will get a negative feedback.  Once your positive feedback falls to a very strict percentage, you are done selling.  You want to talk about fees? It will cost you 10% plus listing fees which are usually under a dollar. There's more. You will also be charged 10% of whatever you charge your customer to ship the item to them. That's right. If you charge $30 to ship your item, Ebay is taking 10% of that too. Now it wouldn't be complete if Paypal didn't come and take 4% of the total transaction too.  So yes, you will lose 14% of the money that is sent to you.  Like Walmart or not, they have it figured out. It's not about how much they make per item, it's about selling as many as you can by reducing the margins.  There are over 100 million Ebay members.  So do the math.  If each of those sell one item per month and it costs them only $1 to sell their item, there's $100 million for Ebay.  This is an unrealistic number obviously because the sales are beyond your imagination. I have no problem with people making money.  But at what point does the greed end.  The fees just don't quit.  It will cost you $125 to list a car whether it sells or not.  Do you have any idea how many vehicles are listed at any given time.  So just like the government, big pharma, the FDA, the power companies, you have legalized criminal activity.  I will add more later. Yep, there's more.  I noticed someone posted a question/concern about a buyer wanting to return an item simply because they changed their mind even though the seller didn't offer returns on that particular item. Let me help the sellers that this hasn't happened to yet.  All a buyer has to do is say the item wasn't as described.  The seller is taking it back. And they are going to pay for the return shipping back to them too.  Yep. If the seller doesn't provide a return label to the buyer, Ebay will take it upon themselves to provide the buyer with one and they will immediately deduct it from you paypal account.  So you, the seller, are out the monies it costed you to send it to them and to get it back from them.  If you stated that you don't offer returns and they changed their mind, the buyer may have to pay the shipping back to you. But if they say it's not as described, the return bill is yours.  This is good information for the millions of people out there that have the integrity of the IRS to buy things, swap it out with yours that doesn't work, and send it back to the seller at their expense because it ""wasn't as described"".  Don't think it happens?  It happens everyday.  I've sold about 3000 items on Ebay in the last 15 years and it's happened about ten times.  That isn't that many you say?  I'm one seller.  There are over 120 million registered Ebayers. Do the math.  If you are a seller, make sure you take pictures of your items that aren't necessarily shown in your item description.  Why?  Because then the buyer doesn't know that you can readily identify your item against the one he sends back to you claiming it doesn't work.  It doesn't work; and that's because it's his broken unit that he sent back to you and he has kept your working unit.  More to come-stay tuned.",1,"“IF YOU ARE A CROOK, BUY FROM EBAY.

He proceeded to use the ""money back guarantee"" loophole. He had no valid grounds to get his $ back as proven by all the photos of the item and the fact that I specified No Returns in my ad knowing that it was new and there would be no reason to return it. Ebay did not investigate the case just gave him his hundreds of dollars back.
Now I have no payment, no canada goose down parka, no help from eBay and the buyer is ignoring all my attempts to contact him to get my parka back which I now know he never had any intention of returning! And Ebay will do Nothing. 
Not only will they do nothing to help me get my product back they want me to pay them their commission!
Remove all $ and access to your $ from the reach of ebay AND paypal. They work together and are thieves!",1,“Ebay is a Scam and you could lose your money AND product” 
727,"Ebay.com is the WORST site out there for selling used items. I would strongly urge people to find a different site or method if they are considering selling online. It isn't a question of IF u get scammed by dishonest buyers, it's WHEN!

With the new ""buyer protection policy,"" Ebay.com has allowed dishonest buyers to rob the sellers. You see, if a buyer has buyer's remorse all they have to do is open an ""item not as described"" case. It doesn't matter if the seller says ""no returns or refunds."" It doesn't matter if the item is accurately described in the listing and photos. It does not matter if the item in question is being sold as is, for parts, or repair. None of that matters. Ebay.com will ALWAYS side with the buyer, and force the seller to take a refund. Oh, and they usually also force the seller to pay for return shipping!

Let me tell you my personal story regarding this. I have been an Ebay.com member for 10 years and have been selling for just over 4 years. I am your average small seller. I sell vintage items from my own personal collection when I really need some extra money.

A few weeks ago, I listed an antique item on Ebay.com. This item was from the 1920's, so it did have some wear and tear. I took several close up photos at every different angle to show the damage and imperfections. I pointed out the damage in my listing, even going as far to say - ""the damage can be seen in photo number 5."" I also stated that I would be more than happy to answer questions, provide more info or photos if any bidder was unsure of the piece. I did get a few questions regarding this item. I was brutally honest in my messages - just as I had been in the listing when describing the damage. I believe it put some buyers off, but I am completely honest about the condition of the things I sell.

A week went by and the item sold for about $70. The winning bidder had asked no questions about the item at all. I sent him a message thanking him for his fast payment and informing him I would mail the item the next day. He did not reply to the message at all.

The buyer received the item within 3 days. That day, he began messaging me. He was very rudely accusing me of selling junk. He was furiously complaining about the EXACT DAMAGE AND IMPERFECTIONS THAT WERE SHOWN IN THE DESCRIPTION AND PHOTOS! He did not read the description OR view photos before impulse bidding.

I refused a refund or a return for buyer's remorse. I have no problem with returns or refunds in general, I have given them in the past for items that were lost in the mail. But this was ridiculous! I don't see why I should have to refund or take a return for something that was completely 100% accurately described just because he couldn't be bothered to read the description or view the photos.

Anyway, after he found out I would not be intimidated by his demands or rude behavior, he threatened me, ""followed"" me on my Ebay profile and left negative feedback. I reported him to Ebay.com for abusing the buyer protection policy, leaving false feedback, and harassment/threats. NOTHING was done.

The buyer then opens a return case. My Paypal funds are instantly froze. Again, I refuse to refund or return an item for buyer's remorse. I assume the case will be escalated to Ebay, so I begin writing a statement, gathering information, and making a solid case in my favor.

Another week goes by and as expected, the case was escalated to customer support. Well, Ebay.com did NOT ASK ME ANYTHING! They did NOT ask for my side of the story! They did not give me any way to reply to the case or defend myself and instead RULED IN FAVOR OF THE LYING BUYER! The case was escalated, Ebay supposedly ""reviewed"" it (although, I strongly believe it is done by a computer, not a real person), and the buyer was immediately rewarded with a return , even though I REFUSED SEVERAL TIMES.

If anyone at Ebay had bothered to look at the listing they could clearly see the item was 100% accurately described! Nothing was left out at all. The photos were spot on perfect.

Oh, and this is where it gets really interesting! The item returns to me - BROKEN! Because the *** buyer couldn't be bothered to pack it properly. So I contact ebay, asking for reimbursement since their forced return is the reason for the item being broken. They say I have no proof and they can't take my word for it. REALLY? I have video proof! The item did NOT look like that when it left my home. But oh no, sellers are *** of the earth to ebay. Ebay will never take a seller's word for anything, even when they have proof. If you are a seller, no amount of proof will help you win a case. But if one of their precious angelic buyer's says something is damaged, it is taken as ABSOLUTE TRUTH WITH NO PROOF NEEDED.

(And don't even get me started on their customer support! They will pass you from one person to the next, each saying something different, but none being any help whatsoever. Total waste of time.)

Needless to say, I am completely DONE with this disgusting website/company. I will never sell on Ebay.com ever again. I will not buy anything on this site or even consider browsing it ever again. I will be encouraging everyone I know to stop using it as well. I have had great success with this so far, after telling my experience.

I will now be closing my account and selling any unwanted items on another website (which has much lower fees), locally or donating them to charity.",1,“Ebay treats sellers like crap”

So after reading Ebays advice,  ie contact seller first and see if it can be resolved, and sellers advice, contact them first before raising it as a problem, I returned the item to seller. They told  me to send it Recorded service and get proof of postage, I did and it was £11.99. Post office explained it was 1 cm over size so had to go into next postage bracket. I had used same packaging. I had to be guided by post office charges, it was not up to me! When I contacted seller they said it was faulty but they wouldn't refund full postage , only £3.57 , so I am £8 out for pocket because seller sent me broken clock. I contacted seller and they said I should have gone through eBay to return it, it would only have costed £2.99. Too late now. I rang eBay and they said returns postage costs was up to seller and buyer, they couldn't help......... Then why don't they remind you of this when they tell you to resolve matters with seller , I foolishly thought the seller would honour our verbal agreement for full postage refund........

EBAY WANTED ME TO GET AN ESTIMATE AND UNLESS THE ENGINE OR TRANSMISSION DAMAGE WAS OVER $1000 THEY COULD NOT HELP. EVERYTHING ON THE CAR WAS CRUMBLING APART. iM OUT $10K FOR THE TRUCK AND THE REPAIRS ARE WELL OVER THAT BIT BY BIT.

733,"I sold a gift card. Buyer claimed it was empty. It wasn't. I tried to communicate with buyer, they did not respond. As I had my card back full of funds, I refunded the buyer. I left buyer negative feedback about what a hassle the whole thing had been. Buyer retaliated by saying I sold her an empty gift card. I contacted ebay to have it removed. I had evidence that gift card was full. They said it didn't matter what the truth was, whether the card had money or not. In their opinion I did not work with the buyer enough to show them ""how to use the product"". SO after MUCH hassle and headache I was left with a review saying I sold an empty gift card, regardless of proof opposite. I thought I did everything by the book, and I still got screwed. It didn't matter who was ""right"", only that the incompetent person who couldn't figure out how to use a gift card didn't receive proper ""help"" from me. Bad review stands.

734,"I had my selling privileges revoked back in 2013 because I started another account, linked it to the main one (which is perfectly allowed) and started trying to dropship (which also, according to the policies I scoured beforehand, was allowed). 

They revoked selling privileges for both accounts with no warning or information on WHY it happened. I called them recently to try to get it removed because I really need to start selling on there again, and I was told that it was permanent and that I should sell on a different auction site but i could still buy on eBay! Are you kidding me?

The customer service guy I spoke to was not helpful at all and for most of the call just kept repeating himself instead of giving me actual information. When I finally got a bit angry he finally told me that they were revoked because one of my accounts was caught trying to get around eBay policies, but would not tell me which ones, and would not let me do a thing to fix it.

Now, if this was a second or third strike I probably would never have tried to get my selling privileges back, however I have NEVER been banned, suspended, had listings deleted, or gotten into ANY trouble in the years I was using eBay before this happened. Additionally, I have an account that has ZERO negative feedbacks.

Also I moved from UK to Australia years ago, I got my account switched across but my listings wanted me to put UK post code and wouldn't let me change it to Australian one, not to mention the hundreds of attempts to get the listing right with error messages that didn't make it clear what they wanted or gave no option to fix. I sold 6 things online for free via Gumtree while trying to get one listing on Ebay (I cancelled it as it got dark and had enough). Its is an absoloutly terrible tool to use to sell stuff on they make a simple process far too complicated and the fees are well above what the market rate is or should be. I have been double billed in UK pounds and Australian dollars and so sick of speaking to Ebay reps to fix things or to ask them to fix things they told me they had!!!

748,Ebay has no consideration what-so-ever for the seller. A buyer can return an item even if the seller does not accept returns and the description was 100% accurate. Whenever a buyer returns an item whether you accept returns or not it affects your seller rating which can cause more fees to be charged as well as less views for your item. Ebay charges 10% of your total sales as it is which is outrageous for how poor their customer service is towards sellers. Also it takes hours just to reach an Ebay representative over the phone who will more than likely have no answer towards your problem. They will most likely tell you that you are just $#*!ed. Worst site you could possibly sell on. They definitely need new management as well as a change to their Ebay policies. With how $#*!ty their customer service is they should be charging no more than 5% of total sales.

Also, eBay will give you inane suggestions for selling that don't tell you how to do it smart-just to basically give your items away after eBay and PayPal TAKES their cut-no wonder people are leaving eBay and trying to find an alternative-and not having much luck-at least where I'm standing-but someone could surprise me-
In closing-if you sell on eBay-stop now before you lose more money than you probably already have-I have sold several items and have gotten lucky walking away with a few bucks profit-but eBay will lose me too-if I wanted to sell online-I want to do it and make some money, not give most of it back to eBay to pay for their CEOs and their perks
And making a seller pay to have THEIR money transferred from eBay to PayPal? Are you kidding me?

783,"Here are ten new signs the auction bully is dying...

No matter what ingenious new tricks eBay comes up with to manipulate their users, the Internet giant continues to fall behind in the race to outrun its avalanche of angry users.  The site is now experiencing its lowest rating of trust since a series of aftershocks that continue to rock eBay ever since their disastrous facelift of 2008.  And here's how they're doing it.

For years, they naively hoped the fallout from that self-inflicted gunshot would have blown east and been forgotten, but the hits from those catastrophic decisions just keep on a-comin'.  Here are the latest Top Ten on eBay's ""Hit Parade of Self-Destructive Mistakes"".

1.  Following on the heels of stratospheric fee increases that drove hundreds of thousands of sellers off the site, this latest round of bad decisions began when they masked all users' ID's from the listings.  After February, 2008, eBay buyers and sellers would only see scrambled anagrams where user's screen names used to be. 

2.  Next, they compromised the Feedback scoring system.  The misleading way it works today is that all of a seller's complaints are automatically laundered from the mathematics after twelve months.  That means as far as eBay is concerned, any prolific thief with a despicable track record only needs to wait twelve months and all is forgiven.  What may have been a 62% score due to excessive complaints suddenly becomes a 100% score - or a false reading of fresh cleanliness - after 12 months when the timer is reset.

3.  Then, they removed the bidder's search feature. That kept the growing wave of users who were suspicious of fraudulent activity, from tracking and identifying illegal bidding activity. 'Shill' bidding is an age-old, unethical and highly illegal auction trick which eBay only flaccidly discouraged, but which they now aggressively promote (since it can no longer be traced) as a way of injecting revenue into sagging profits.  The way it works is, the seller gets his family and friends to place fake bids.  Then, when the high bid reaches what the seller wants for the item, the fake bidders step back and let legitimate bidders take over.  The winning bidder never knows who was bidding, or if they were even legitimate, and he ends up paying many times what the item would have sold for without the fake (shill) bids.

4.  Next, they launched a nebulous program to phase out all contact between buyers and sellers.  The ''Ask a Question"" button disappeared from the main body of the listing, and ended up buried toward the bottom of the page, among the fine print and legalese.  Buyers can still make contact, but their inquiries (and sellers' replies) are audited and users' emails scrambled.  And these Mafiosos are dead serious: if a conversation goes past two emails, the buyer will usually get a threatening email warning from eBay, often followed by a telephone call with bullying and more threats.  The bewildered buyer is then drop-kicked from the site ""for abusing"" the 'Ask a Question' feature.

5.  The Item Number identifying the listing has also disappeared from plain view, and can only be found, literally, by using a high-intensity magnifying glass. 

6.  Frustrated they could no longer make casual contact with sellers, buyers began relying more and more on the seller's feedback score rating, which included how often complaints are logged, dates of entries and how long the seller has been active.  But now all those revealing features have been removed - either buried in more off-page 'drill-down' or eliminated altogether. 

7.  Another compromise reflects eBay's seductive efforts to keep buyers from looking at the listing, once the item has been paid for.  On every reference after the sale, from emails to Leave Feedback to the My eBay page, all links to the item's description have been removed.  Apparently, eBay concluded, bidders might get ""buyer's remorse"", so not only is the listing software scrambled so the listing won't print once the sale has ended, buyers are further discouraged from even referring back to it.  This is an especially effective way to keep buyers from comparing the listing details against the item, when it doesn't look right after it's been received.

8.  Finally, watch out for eBay's new ""fake opinion link"".  This button usually appears somewhere around the Feedback pages and asks how you like the new changes.  If you fall for this trick, you click on it and up pops a dialog box for comments.  But - surprise! - there's no 'submit' button.  It's a hoax page that can't be submitted to anyone, and it will remain on your screen until you cancel it, unsent.

9.  The cumulative results of all this finally had a whiplash effect: the loss of all personal communication has turned users into nameless, faceless robots who feel no obligation for truth, honesty or courtesy.  And that isn't boding well for their folksy ""thank you for being part of the eBay family"". 

10.  A 19-year eBay employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said eBay's eventual goal is to scrub all identifying data about buyers and sellers, leaving only the item being sold and eBay's own profit-driven payment software.  That means names, locations, complaints, dates, feedback, seller ratings and questions will gradually disappear from the site, leaving the buyer-victim alone on a dark, slippery slope with the anonymous person he's about to deal with.

""The plan launched in 2008 was to implement these changes slowly, so as not to create another stampede from the site,"" the source said, drawing on the analogy of putting a frog into a pot of water and letting it come to a gradual boil.  ""It was structured to be a ten-year plan, but it appears that may be extended,"" he said, declining to explain further.

When questioned about increasing complaints of eBay sellers making deliberately false representations about everything from toys, antiques, electronics and auto parts, to sellers mailing a paper picture of an expensive item the bidder believed he was actually buying, the source deflected the question saying only, ""Buyers always have the option of returning something if they aren't happy.""  Predictably, eBay's own recent polls reflect the lowest level of seller trust in the site's twenty-year history. 

He then made a reference to the eBay Buyer Protection Program.  But hundreds of thousands of bidders aren't happy with that protection, citing fine print that excludes virtually everything, which fact only comes to light when there's a problem.  If something ever does qualify, it's usually an inexpensive item, and then it's only covered under a narrowly defined, highly irregular set of circumstances. 

As for eBay, it doesn't appear there's any turning back.  Jiminy Cricket said it best: ""You buttered your bread, now sleep in it,"" meaning, you've made your own mess, take care of it yourself.

795,"If you intend to sell books thru Half.com, please be warned and advised.  This site does not care about sellers. They cancelled our selling account after 10 years of long standing good history, because of a supposed shipping violation; they never explained the violation even though we requested explanation several times.  Only possible communication with them is via email (they call themselves ""an online company"");  the online customer representative was very rude and not helpful, ignored all our questions or concerns and simply kept referring us to their ""help"" pages.  Since half.com accounts link to eBay.com, this caused our eBay.com account to also be blocked, which is a totally different site with different policies.  This blocks seller activity also on the other site, and doesn't even let you use the account for buying any product; but half.com  did not care about helping resolve the situation.  The eBay people tried to help but they could not do anything about the already blocked account.

On top of this half.com does not immediately pay seller revenues, as policy they only pay twice a month and they provide no option for requesting immediate payment if you are in urgent need of the money.  So upon cancelling an account like they did to us, they place your pending payments on a 60-day hold period, which we doubt is legal.  After 60 days when you try to reclaim the frozen funds they come up with another list of hurdles and ""account identity validations"" in order to release your money.  In our case we did not have any extra identity validations to do since our account had current up-to-date information, so then the customer representative simply stopped responding to our email requests for payment.  (There is no way to contact them via phone).

We had to call ebay for advise, the provided a phone number for half.com 800-545-9857, when you call this number it is an endless loop voice response system that never connects you to a real person.  So, when there is a problem with this people, there is no simple way to resolve issues and you are stuck, and THEY ARE EXTREMELY DISREGARDING AND DISRESPECTING OF SELLERS, who are THE ONES WHO ALLOW THEM TO EARN THE STEEP FEES they charge on every book sale.

If you intend to sell with this company beware of their questionable and unfair practices, try to take your business somewhere else.

(PayPal is owned by ebay) - They know they have the largest amount of viewers looking to buy items, and that they're the largest online auctioning website. So they can get away with being tyrants, and feeing the crap out of hard working sales people. - Also their policies are terrible!! Heres an example of their return policy; Lets just say you sell an item for $500 that you've bought for $350. You've just instantly lost $50 off that from the ""10% roughly"" selling fee, and have also lost ""lets just say $10"" for the insertion fee. Then to add on top of that they'll take about 3% off the $500 for PayPal fees, thus making you lose a total of $75 (so even if there wasn't a customer return you'd only make $75 profit). Where I'm getting at with this is that if a customer decides to return that item for some reason, ebay will automatically give them a FULL refund of $500 out of YOUR pocket.. Thus making you lose $75 for no reason what so ever besides having that item listed and getting it back.. - In my opinion both ebay and Paypal should also give the seller their money back for all three fee's they've charged them. But why would they care when they already have your money in their pockets and there's nothing you can do about it because you've already agreed to the terms and conditions?

I often wondered how they got away with the way they disregard the consumer protection laws. I have not used eBay in more than a year now, and I will not go back. I would love to see Jeff Bezos (Amazon) take them on, and it seems as though a bit at a time he is doing exactly that, and in fact eBay is losing market share annually, as various entities take over what used to be entirely their's alone.

I'm a single mother so I worked my butt off and saved up just enough for this phone. With Cricket being bought out by AT&T, phones that are not GSM capable will not be able to be used for the Cricket service. This change happens in just a matter of days. I saved up and bought this phone well before the change happened so I wouldn't be without a phone. I got the phone in the mail, and it didn't work. I called Ebay right away explaining to them my situation and how I needed my money back. They said I had to wait 5 days and if I don't hear from the merchant, they will refund my money to my paypal account and tell me what I need to do as far as sending it back. I wasn't fond of having to wait. I figured I should be able to send this broken phone back right away since it didn't work, but I waited because I had to. So I call ebay back after the 5 days for my refund, they tell me I wont be getting a refund until the merchant has received the phone back. I explained to them the situation with the cell phone company being bought out and im on a huge time crunch now because I was sent a damaged phone. They didn't care at all. They still refuse to refund my money until I go to kinkos, print out the label they sent me, return the phone and then wait for it to reach the merchant. I will NOT have my money refunded back to me before Cricket makes the change to only GSM capable phones. This means im not only out hundreds of dollars (not only for the phone itself but the accessories for the phone as well as the cost to turn the phone on and the first months payment, as I switched to a new carrier, and none or this is refundable).

829,"On 20 January 2015, I purchased a Macbook Pro laptop on eBay for $791. The seller listed it in working order and having been inspected by Apple. The seller had excellent feedback, excellent communication, and it arrived promptly on 23 January.

Just over a week later, the logic board failed, and the seller refused to accept a return, a partial refund for the estimated cost of repairs (an additional $425), or provide documentation that it had been inspected by Apple. The repair shop where I had it inspected confirmed that the logic board was faulty, and that the failure was not caused by user error.

I opened a case with eBay on 3 February stating that the item was not as described (since the seller had no proof that it had been inspected by Apple), and it had failed within the time frame of their 30-day Buyer Protection clause. Ebay closed the case on 5 February in favour of the seller stating that because I had owned it for a week before contacting the seller for a return, it had been altered and was no longer returnable. My purchase should be covered under eBay's 30-day protection, but they have instead sided with a seller who lied about the condition of the computer.

I have spoken directly with the case manager at eBay, but she was not helpful. I have contacted the seller once again requesting a partial refund for cost of repairs or a full refund for a return.

I have filed official complaints about eBay's customer service with the Better Business Bureau and IC3; but I am still out $791 for a computer shaped brick, and an additional $425 if I want it repaired. I cannot contest the charge through PayPal, because the case has been closed, and I cannot contest the charge with my bank, because the seller refuses to authorise a return for the computer.

The customer service team is unhelpful, rude, and hung up on me twice after I respectfully requested to appeal the case. I have been an eBay customer since 2006, and I have had excellent dealings with eBay up until now. But I can honestly say that I have never been made to feel so helpless and insulted by a company that I once trusted.

I purchased a seat cover and paid also for the delivery charges but I did not receive the item and my payment will not be refunded nor my item will not be delivered. As it is my first time buying from ebay, I had input all my details and address, I don't know that PO box is required coz normally if PO box is crucial information the details will not be saved unless you input something on the PO box. So, my order was completed without me entering PO box no. After more than a month, my order came but custom returned back without calling me because there is no PO BOX. I sent several mails to seller but no reply from the seller's side. I then escalated the case to customer support but got the worst support.Customer support said since I did not put PO box I will not get my payment and my order.

He does not have any physical address he could be in NJ or China.  He is running a big internet scam by selling to people broken and defective electronic equipments.

In February 03, 2014 I bought ""Full HD LED-86 1080P Projector 2800 Lumens Contrast 2000:1 Support 16:9 freely"" from ebay  - item# 400503212275 the price for this projector was $279.90. I paid trough Paypal  $279.90 i paid for it at 13:53:54. I used my debit card at PAYPAL tracking number is 1ZRW54494397091711 to pay for it.  The reason i decide to report that seller it is because the seller quotes """"1 year warranty from date of purchase record."""" In the past several weeks i was trying to chat with the seller in a way that i get my broken projector fixed he/she was ignored me each time he wrote me he asked to go to a local shop for repair which i did and I repeated myself so many times by telling him no local shop had that cable.  All the techs kept telling me this should go back to the manufacture or where it was purchased and i asked him can i have a physical address to send it back. Since June 14th 2014 i kept asking the seller for a replacement or my money back he just answered quoted ""Sorry Which cable it is?"" After that i called EBay and paypal they told me if the seller did not do anything after 3 days you should file an online complaint.  Paypal and Ebay called the seller about the one year warranty promise.  Also, they referred me to this website in order to file this complaint. At this time, Ebay and Paypal cannot do that much cause their policies are only covered an item in bet 45-90 days from the day of purchasing it. The main reason that i want report this seller he claimed that his item has covered for a period of 12 months and last time he wrote to me that after 60 days he cannot do anything for me.  Now, I became a victim of the internet scam and i need my replacement and my money back from the seller.  Please help me to get either the replacement or my full refund.  You can also try this number as +86 13545133038.  I did not stop to tell him that i am a teacher and i use this projector to teach he does seem to be cared at all.   HELP HELP HELP PLEASE

Incredibly RUDE and LACK of customer service to a first time customer. She sells Hermes on eBay. I read her so called blog and boasts highly of her amazing customer service. I'm interested in one of her Hermes bags. It cost quite a lot for that bag. So I asked her to see additional pictured of the bag. Since in her listing, she only have pictures of front,bag,side views. No interior picture,no date code, no nothing! It is such an incomplete listing so I asked her that I need additional pictures to make decision. That should be no problem. Everything should go smoothly.
But she replied me with a whole paragraph of insults! I have never ever seen any business does that to a customer. To insult a customer! 
But this woman does it. I still am in total shock. I have met with not so good customer service such as slow shipment, incomplete information, and product not so good.

Insult to injury.  SHAME ON EBAY. I did pay to return it with tracking, for the principle of it all, and ebay removed the feedback.

952,"Good morning good people. I have a warning for you. Please read. If you use ebay your are going to get screwed.  I have lost my item and my money FOR THE LAST TIME and the bad part about it is that the buyers are using ebay to strong arm money and items from YOU THE seller. This is becoming more and more frequent. After talking to ebay it is quite clear that they side with the buyer and not the seller however. They feel that the buyer is the one who is responcable for paying the fees even thou it come out of the sellers account and it is a percentage of the sellers money that pays for final selling fees that are not calculated in to the price of the item. Im sorry for the rant, but Ebay feels they are way too big and can do what they wish and there is nothing we can do about it. 

I sold an item, I fully disclosed that the item had broke at one point and time and I had it repaired however the item no longer was the opposing side from its mate they were now the same side. I decided just to get rid of the item because I didnt want to deal with having it repaired again so I listed the item on ebay with full description. I also listed the item for 30% less that it would have gone for being fixed in order to give the buyer the financial availability to have the item fixed and still get a good deal.

After the sale I shipped out the item right away I heard nothing from the buyer. After a month the buyer contacted me and told me that the item was miss represented and was the same side. I copied and pasted the description so that he could read it again and he claimed that it was trickery and started saying that I was scamming him. He opened a Ebay dispute. And I returned his money for the item. 

Once a buyer opens a dispute with ebay they yank the funds from your account. Because ebay owns paypal. Talk about a conflict of interest. This means if you are playing in ebays play ground if you dont do what ebay wants remember  they are the prosecutor , judge and the jury aka (school yard bully). Here lies the problem. Once a case is open ebay always sides with the seller. My case was opened and the buyer still didnt want to read the description. So, in order to save time. Issued the refund because once ebay is involved they freeze your account. With my work schedule I cant run and check the computer every day much less deal with a illiterate person. However I have to put my faith in ebay because I am at their mercy  at this point.  

Now that the funds were refunded to the buyer ebay was satisfied and closed the case with out demanding that the buyer return the item. Needleless to say the buyer does not have to return the item. Ebay does nothing to enforce that you get your product back. However they will ruin you if you dont give a refund.  I called ebay this morning and was less than satisfied with their responses. They basically told me to pound sand. They made it quite clear that if the buyer does not want to ship the item back then they dont have to. There is nothing they can do in order to make the buyer comply so in short Ebay took the sellers ability to leave bad feed back to the buyer so that the seller can warn other sellers about bad buyers and buyers who run scams such as this. This is called strong arming and with ebay owning both pay pal and ebay they have full control. Because of this bad business practice and dysfunctional policies I am deleting my ebay account that I have had for 15 years. I can no longer afford to give refunds and my product away.. This would be like buying a new tv from walmart then going back the next day and getting a refund but in Wal-Marts case they have the right and the ability to say not until the item is returned, this is where ebay bullies the seller because they take away your right to do this.  However ebay does not enforce the buyer to return the item so this is more like a bully at a school yard. Im sure there is a another auction on line like ebay I think it is called Ubid or something like that. This is where Im going. Ebay was such an awesome place however in the recent years they have seriously gone down the toilet.",1,“Good morning good people”

957,"ENCOURAGES FRAUD
CHARGES FOR DEFECTIVE SERVICE
VIOLATES CONSUMER RIGHTS
AND THEN EXTORTS THE CONSUMER'S FAMILY FOR NOT PAYING!

That is because they have the absolute WORST policies, complete lack of leadership, bad attitudes throughout the corporate hierarchy, do not properly train their staff, and in general show contempt for the consumer.  If you look around online, you will see this sentiment is echoed by their own employees, including those who still work there.  Even their current staff disapproves of how the company is being run.

Ebay aids and abets fraud through its policies.  They violate consumer law by charging for defective service or service not received.

When it comes to buyer protection, they lack the resources and their staff lacks the proper training to effectively research and pass judgment on a claim.  There is a complete lack of rational thinking and respect for the consumer, and no understanding of consumer law.  All of their decisions in claims are based on inflating their bottom line, in reckless disregard for the consumer's rights or rights of the property holder.

I have lost hundreds of $ to ebay and their bungling.  They have apologized to me more than once, but it just doesn't make up for the damage they have inflicted and continue to fail to address.  And every time I have it out with them, I get another apology, another confirmation that I owe them nothing and that I have losses, immediately followed by a demand for $ I do not owe them.  If my account balance is zero, what are they billing me for?

Every decision they make on any claim has more to do with limiting their own loss and risk, increasing their bottom line, and nothing at all to do with consumer protection or the correct, legal, or fair thing to do.  They say one thing and then do the complete opposite.

Ebay tried to debit my bank for refund money in a bogus claim-  money that had never been paid to me, from a buyer that had already been given an Unpaid-Item-Strike for non-payment.  I was forced to change my bank account information to prevent ebay from debiting me and to sever my contacts with them.  

I had to give up an ebay store where I had been successfully vending with a great reputation, which took me over a decade to build up. I was deprived of my client lists and my e-mail marketing lists and prevented from contacting my audience.  I lost property as a result of ebay's errors, and I had no choice but to flea the website, fearing for the further loss of property and money, and they have the nerve to try to bill me for 2 months worth of store subscription fees that occurred AFTER they aided a con-artist and abetted fraud, during which time they left me waiting for follow-up resolution action they promised me in the first 72 hours and never provided for 2 1/2 months.  

And all I get now is a promise from ebay that they will not try to debit me for that refund amount again, a worthless apology, and a request to pay them for 2 months of service that I do not want, service they themselves put on my account only because they did not follow up on the case in the first 72 hours as they guaranteed me they would, and for which their own reps have told me I do not owe.  Why do I have to pay for the 2 1/2 months worth of time that they NEGLECTED me, on a fraudulent claim they never should have allowed in the first place?  

I canceled and voided my contract with ebay on the basis of defective service, in accordance with my consumer rights.  I would say that if a website allows another user to scam you for money they are not due, then tells you they will fix it in ""not longer than 72 hours"" and then does not act for 2 1/2 months, leaving you wide open to further fraud, that seems like pretty defective service to me.  For ebay to then bill me for subscription fees during this time is an egregious violation of consumer trust.

I have spoken to their reps so many times, and they just do not have the mental capability to understand that any person would be unable to effectively transact anything on their website during that 2 1/2 months.  How can you trust any of the transactions if any buyer can simply take money out of your bank without having paid it in the first place, and that will be not only allowed by ebay, but they will actually provide the means and method by which to steal from the seller?  I am not talking about risk of loss or non-delivery here, but rather the original payment-  as in, the buyer never paid, and ebay forced me to pay them instead.  That is ebay-supported FRAUD.

I was on the phone with their resolutions department for over 2 hours, while they profusely apologized and explained to me that they simply never realized that anyone would use their new dispute resolution to steal money from sellers.  Really?  How can you put a dispute resolution system in place and be so stupid as to not foresee it being misused in that fashion?  It flies in the face of reason.  The mere fact that they allowed this gaping hole in their software and policies in the first place is alarming and should warrant some legal intervention.

At the end of that phone call, and after all the apologies, they invited me to open a new account and start fresh at a later date.  So after my anger and dismay dissipated over the course of a year I did. I figured I would give them another chance, and see if they had fixed the enormous holes in the system.  Well they shut my second account down, telling me I had ""policy violations"" on the first account!  WHAT policy violations?  because i don't want to pay a scam artist money I don't owe?  because I exercised my right to void the contract and close the account when they engaged in shoddy, defective service that caused me to get ROBBED?  

I have asked numerous account reps to confirm that my old, original account had a zero balance, and they told me yes it did, and nothing was owed, but then they tell me I have policy violations and an unpaid bill.  They invited me to come back and use their site again and then shut me down for doing so.  Then I got collections notices from them over this, and after showing the collections company all the info, they refused to collect it for ebay, because it was a bogus bill, and I don't owe them anything.  They are just harassing me for sticking up for myself and for exposing the poorly designed system they put in place.

To add insult to injury, I ended up on the other end of an INR claim with ebay, when buying on my second account that they invited me to open and then closed when I complained, I had to file not one but TWO chargebacks for items I never received.  At least I actually PAID the sellers before filing INR, and ebay was going to refuse to give my money back when I received nothing at all.  So much for their new ""buyer protection"".  It only protects them, ebay. NO one else.

Ebay made a mistake and misread the tracking info, declined me for a refund even though I never got the products, even on appeal, they simply could not examine a simple tracking system and see those items had been delivered to the wrong place.  I did pay the bill and never got my purchases, so I had my bank reverse the transactions and override ebay's decision and get my money back.  Every time ebay missteps and steals from me, I have to rely on my bank to shield me and protect me from ebay's bungling and stupidity.

This is because their staff is poorly trained, cannot learn to read tracking information, or they just plain don't bother to look at claims at all and make rulings based on their own corporate profit margins. If they feel they can sacrifice you more easily than the other party, then that is how they rule the decision, even when no money has been exchanged!  They do not care one iota for the consumer.  They only care about money.  IF the buyer is making them a higher profit margin, they rule in his favor.  I guess I just wasn't making enough money for ebay, so they have a standing policy of throwing me under the bus.

Can you see what is happening here?  I've got 3 cases in the space of about 2-3 years-  one case where I was ordered by ebay to repay money that was never paid to me. THAT IS FRAUD.  SUPPORTED BY EBAY.  

And then 2 cases where I was guaranteed protection against non-delivery, where I DID pay the sellers, and was refused a refund by ebay, despite bogus and faulty tracking.  And in all 3 of those cases, ebay has been proven WRONG and responsible for my losses.

BUT WAIT!  IT GETS WORSE!!!

After all of this, my mom wanted to sell some things on ebay to make some extra $, and despite my warnings against it I could not convince her otherwise.  ""Forget it and move on"" was the attitude, because we figured what were the odds of this happening again?  and we've got the bank on speed-dial now in case of any claim being filed against her or me on ebay, we simply call our bank and change our bank account info before ebay even responds to a dispute, as a preventative measure, as we know that ebay has a history of doing the wrong thing and siding with the wrong party.  

So I helped her out by giving my mother some of my things to sell on her own ebay site, which was registered solely in her name, at her address, in a different state, with completely separate registration information, separate banking info, and account history going back years.  

There was no connection between the 2 accounts other than the fact that we are related, and I gifted my mom my old childhood toys (which were already stored at her own home, shipped from her home, some of which she herself paid for 25 years prior when I was a child!) for her to sell and make some $.  

And ebay had the nerve to shut down my mother's account and instructed her to take action on my old account and to pay my ""bill"".  The same bill that I DO NOT OWE them, that their own account reps recognize as a giant BLUNDER, because they have no right charging me, and I canceled my contract with them.  

I have even called them to argue about this and settle it, and have been told by more than one customer service rep that my account balance is zero and I owe nothing, and that ""someone failed to finalize the release of your account"".  Then they put me on hold to go do this, come back on the phone, and ask me for $200 again!

And then they shut down my mom's account and literally instructed her to ""take action"" on my account, which is ILLEGAL.  That is EXTORTION.  I do not have any legal rights towards my mother's account, and she does not have any legal rights toward mine.  I'm an adult.  I'm in my thirties!  My parents are not legally bound to pay for my billing disputes. 
Yet here is ebay refusing my mother service on her account which is in good standing and telling her that she can't get service until she pays a bill in someone else's name for the sole reason that we are related.  Is ebay a loan shark now?  Is that the behavior we can expect from ebay in the future?  That is what the mafia does. Is ebay the Mafia?  because they sure do act like it.  

She doesn't even know my password and had no way to get into the old account. And it is nearly impossible to get any help from customer service.  It is just non-existent. We've got customer service telling us to respond by e-mail and e-mails that say we can only call to get a resolution.  When the original fraud occurred on my original account, I was left on hold with ebay for over 40 minutes just to be disconnected without ever speaking to an account rep.  It took them 2 1/2 months to call me back.  2 years later, and when my mother calls to fix her illegally restricted account, she is referred back to her e-mail, which refers her to call which refers back to e-mail....  
Bottom line:  EBAY SCREWED UP and they are shoving my entire family under the rug for it.

We asked the state's attorney's general's office in our home state of NJ, and they were mortified that ebay would demand that my mom take action on an account that does not belong to her, for $ that is not owed (by ebay's own admission), and all because ebay goofed and allowed a fraudulent INR claim to be processed over 2 years prior.  

This is the kind of vindictive, unlawful behavior that ebay has become synonymous with.  This is why on chat forums the world over it has achieved the nickname ""evil-bay"".

This company needs to be gutted from the top down, and it's corporate leadership entirely replaced with people who have a soul, an IQ, and a conscience.

I have gone as far as to lodge complaints with BBB and the states' attorneys general, and I got a reply from ebay's office of the president that complained about my ""attitude"".  HA!  MY attitude?  are they kidding?!  In light of what has happened, I don't think my own attitude is the one at issue here.  And just imagine telling any other customer anywhere in a retail situation their mother should pay their bill because of their attitude.  They are just begging for a lawsuit.

Please excuse me if this reads as a rant, but that is what ebay deserves:  A RANT that exposes the corruption and utter lack of ethics that have become the core character of what was once a simple classifieds list.  How far they have sunk!  If I could give them a negative star, I would  F--  and please picture me spitting on the floor in disgust.",1,“ENCOURAGES FRAUD” 
958,"There are two perspectives that one can rate this site from:  the buyer's viewpoint, or the sellers.  As a buyer, I would have no complaints.  But today I am rating this as a seller, because this is what I have been using eBay most for.  

I have learned through experience that eBay has very little protection for sellers.  A seller cannot leave negative feedback for a bad buyer, for one.  He or she can only file an unpaid item claim.  This process locks up the item for at least 8 days before it can be relisted.  And there's the expense; eBay is costly, though I guess that's what you pay for brand recognition.  

However, these all are just minor frustrations compared to my major complaint; eBay protects unreasonable buyers at the seller's expense.  To elaborate, a buyer can open a Buyer Protection case if they want a refund due to some perceived error on the part of the seller, such as an improperly described item.  If resolution can not be made via email between buyer and seller, eBay makes a decision on the case as to who is at fault.  If in favor of the buyer, refund is forced.  But if in favor of the seller, eBay removes the Buyer Protection case from the seller's record so it doesn't negatively affect his or her seller rating, and the seller is not required to issue a refund.  That's the process.  However, even if a seller wins a protection case, this does not block the buyer from leaving negative feedback, and what appears prominently for all to see is the feedback rating, not the seller rating.  

Negative feedback stings.  Whether a seller wins or loses a protection case, they still lose, because they are pretty much guaranteed a negative feedback either way.  This creates an environment where the seller must try to bend over backwards for even the most unreasonable, or even fraudulent, customer in order to try to avoid negative feedback, and still has no protection if that buyer leaves undeserved negative feedback.  And no, eBay does not allow that feedback to be removed, even if you have proof that you were in the right or have won a case in your favor; their customer service has said as much to me.  

So to conclude, I have lost my trust in eBay to protect me as a seller.  Their ""seller protection"" is worthless to protect what really matters; my feedback rating.  Unreasonable buyers and scammers are a reality for sellers; it's only a matter of time.  As such, I will not be selling on eBay anymore.",1,“There are two perspectives that one can rate this site...”

966,"I've been using ebay since 2001 and while being a buyer is great, especially when you're looking to score something cool for a cheap price. Unless you're looking for a really hard to find item, say something from your childhood. Then I would recommend  sites like Amazon, GoHastings, etc. instead. As a seller on the other hand, let's just say that I have a few horror story's that I could tell you. One instance, while I was studying Graphic Design I opened up an ebay store and sold custom made t-shirts and hoodys. The primary color was Black, but I gave customers the option to pick from various colors. Well one day I had an order for one of my hoody's. So I made it. Packaged it. Mailed it and informed the customer it was on it's way and thanked them ever so much for their business. Only to get a very nasty and rude email a few days later saying they did not receive what they ordered. Apparently when they placed their order they requested the hoody in White. Yet when I brought up the invoice and even showed it to them, there was no mention anywhere that they wanted it in White and not the primary Black. After making numerous attempts to satisfy the customer. They were rude, insulted me, and filed a dispute against me over the whole ordeal. When I offered to replace them item with the White hoody, when all they had to do was send the ""wrong"" hoody back. Which they down right refused to do. Ebay and Paypal then shut down my store, and gave the customer a refund without even investigating(which they're supposed to do/even says so in their damn policy). I then presented Ebay and PayPal proof of the invoice from the customers order, that it in fact did not state anything about a ""white hoody"" they did nothing! It wasn't until I threatened them with legal action that they retracted the dispute, found in my favor and allowed me to once again do business. And that was just one instance. Many times I have had paypal with hold funds from me, because someone said they didn't get what they paid for. Only to have me fight with them(Paypal and Ebay), showing proof time and time again. Then they refund me the money they illegally with held, and find in my favor. Ebay is a rip off. They charge you 3x to use their services. They charge you to sell stuff(list items), they charge you when you sell an item, and since they own Paypal they charge you a third time to use that service. It's a monopoly and they will violate their own Terms & Service Agreement that you are sworn to uphold time and time again. If I had the money I would put Ebay out of business with competition.

At first I don't think buyers realized what an impact a less than 5 star rating could have on a seller.  This impacted our account on 2 minor issues and we were taken off ebay as a seller.  I know from our experience over the years that you have to be wary of any bidder who has only 1 or 2 feedbacks because they are not likely to be educated enough to know what the DSR or Negative feedback could mean to the seller.

So rather than have an unused router sitting around collecting dust I figured I'd just pack it up back in the box and sell it.  After all it was barely used and looked as good as new.  I had the original box and everything else that came with it.

I auctioned it off on eBay but all I got was a lousy $14.  The seller sent me $22 (eight bucks for shipping) but after mailing it off and paying paypal and ebay fees all that was left was about $12.

""Oh well,""  I thought.  ""I wasn't using it anyway and $12 is better than nothing.""

After a few days I received an email from the seller complaining that I ripped her off and sold her a router that didn't work.  I wouldn't say she was nasty about it but there was certainly the implication that I knowingly sold her damaged goods.

I responded as nicely as possible that the router was working perfectly when I boxed it up and mailed it and is she sure she's using it right?  I suggested reseting the router back to default settings as that might clear up any problems.

She then wrote back that she tried everything and it doesn't work and she wants a refund.  She'll mail the router back to me but I need to pay the return shipping.",1,“Like many people I've used eBay to sell unwanted items...”

I am a great seller with over 1100 feedbacks most from this year and last year. I was a powerseller and a top rated seller. I worked hard to take care of my reputation and business. All it takes is less than one handful of people to lie or steal from you and you loose your power seller and top ratings. Lakelandgifts is my ID check it out feedback has been great, but if you as a buyer leave less than 5 stars than Ebay dings the seller and eventually limits the number of items you can sell. I have over 1100 satisfied customers, this doesn't matter its the tiny few people Ebay listens too. The majority getting thrown under the bus for the small minority. Ebay limited me on the number of items I can sell to only 70 per month. All because of a few and I mean few like 7 people in a one year total that left me less than 5 star ratings. I have called Ebay 3 times and NEVER have they satisfied me with this problem or any other problem. Even an outright lie from a buyer and proven as a lie did not matter. Ebay is NEVER for a seller. As a buyer you get all kinds of help etc. Without sellers there are no buyers. As more and more great sellers experience the new system changes which began in April 2011 and all the fee increases, you as a seller will see their bottom lines disappear. I have never in my life experienced a more greedy company than Ebay. They need to go back to their grass roots and remember where they came from. I am looking to sell somewhere else and its sad that many of my great customers are suffering because of Ebay's limits and changes. It not only hurts you the seller but eventually you the buyer in the long run. With the new fee increases Ebay and Paypal are taking over 15% of your total selling price plus shipping and don't forget the crazy insertion fees. I enter everything into Quicken to see my bottom line, and it has decreased tremendously. I need to sell elsewhere I hear Ebid.net is catching on, if thats so may God Bless them.

I run a website company, and would buy copies of the Dreamweaver software our content writers use, but my last three transactions were both pirated versions. On one, the seller refunded my money. The third one is what earns eBay my $#@! rating, because eBay let him get away with manipulating the system and cheating me out of my refund. As soon as I discovered it was a pirated copy, I lodged a complaint with the seller. He didn't respond right away, and when he did, eBay didn't tell me until several days before the dispute period was about to expire. I sent back the software according to their instructions, but the seller then delayed his response until the dispute period actually did expire and I was left with not even a pirated copy of the software and he had my money.

Sometime ago he did sell metal buildings but when Mueller would not sell to him any more per their Legal Dept. the scam began. He found all of us from his eBay listings. But did not have us purchase thru them, that way you can't post the truth on eBay and ruin the scam. 

He goes thru the motions with contract, etc. seeming professional till he has your check in hand. Than the psycho behavior begins. Rants, name calling, whatever he can do to get under your skin to cause you to cancel your contract. He will either not give you a delivery date or will tell you New Years Eve 6 - 8pm. If he can't get you to cancel your order, he will cancel it. Than he informs you that you have given him so much grief that he is retaining your payment to him. It's that simple, than it's your job to try to get it back from him.

Google Christbilt and you will see a sampling of the complaints against him, and people you can contact if you have been taken by this man. The other victims can assist you.

What a lot of them do is have friends to increase betting but eBay never does anything to the seller if you report them. I've also won bids and they don't send out the item or they do they claim it was ""lost."" That's not true. You can tell they didn't like that I won the item on a low bid since they went and put the backpack back up. Again, eBay doesn't do anything. I also don't like millions of resellers in the world as of late. These are usually US sellers that are resellers. A lot of things they get in clearance at Michael's and Hobby Lobby they sell at full price plus shipping. I never buy from a US seller unless it's a book I really need and it ends up being cheaper through eBay. My warning is: shop around first even if the item is from China as I've seen them sell paper clips that seem cheap but they sell it individually whereas Hobby Lobby will sell it for cheaper but with a whole bunch of paper clips. That's just an example as I've seen it. It's cheaper to also get books at the thrift store than through EBay sometimes also. Like I said they if I really need or want the book I get it through EBay.

Another warning is that I've seen things from the Dollar Tree and they are selling them at $7.95. That's insane! I cannot stress it enough; shop around first. Sometimes when it seems like a good deal; it's probably not. Especially with US sellers.",2,“This one is tricky”

The catch?  He wasn't willing to return the frames but wanted some sort of 'financial restitution.'  ""Really?!""

In one instance, I spoke to TWO Ebay CSR's (called in twice) BEFORE I made a ""buy it now"" purchase, to have a seller/listing investigated because something didn't seem right. The price for the item listed was way too low.  

The CRS's assured me that it was safe to go ahead and make the purchase despite the sellers reviews.  Naturally, I never received my order.  The tracking # provided by the seller showed that it was apparently ""delivered"" to a totally different province!  Many other buyers were complaining about the exact same thing.

So don't be surprised when you get billed after the fact.",2,"“Lots of good, some real bads” "
999,"There was a time when eBay was king but those days seem long behind us. eBay has gone from a competitive business to just a business with their own interests placed well ahead of the customers! Sure, they talk a good game and appear ""customer service"" oriented, but they are far from it! With all of the things eBay does to secure new buyers and sellers, like eBay bucks and guarantee buyer protection, the experience continues to get worse and worse. One should also ask why eBay felt the need to implement these features...Is it because eBay saw the need to protect buyers and guarantee their purchases when those purchases went sideways? Well, I am a huge purchaser on eBay, but not a seller because I sell privately. I am glad I sell privately because I think my headaches would be doubled if I did twice the business on eBay. The biggest problem I have is that eBay allows sellers who have consistently bad reviews to continue doing business. There seems to be no process, no matter what they say, that punishes sellers who are unscrupulous and clearly scam buyers. I had a seller scam me out of a $85.00 purchase, leave a ""false positive review"" (meaning that the he used the positive feed back medium in order to leave me a bad comment) and he cussed me out via email, which eBay read and this guy is still selling! I also made a recent purchase from a guy who had 1,759 negative feedback remarks. How is a seller who is screwing people over that badly, and that clearly, still being allowed to conduct business on ebay? Why leave any feedback if it does nothing punitively to the seller? Sure feedback helps as a warning to buyers, but sometimes I move to quickly and I don't check seller feedback until it's too late. Scammers have also figured out ways to get your money and keep it and eBay can do little or nothing to prevent this either. Buyer protection is set up so that you have to wait to have eBay pay you back too! What I think needs to happen is this.....First, buyers should be allowed to block any sellers who they believe are conducting shady business or have actually conducted shady business. Seller ratings should be posted right next to their name REALLY BIG AND PROMINENTLY, and on the item they are selling also, so you know what you are getting immediately. This way, if I am moving to quick through a transaction, it won't matter because the seller selling practices will be broken down clearly and obviously so I cannot miss it! Presentation is huge and if an item is being presented in a manner where it says ""Pioneer Turntable being offered by GRADE D seller"" I guarantee that seller would do everything that they could to change that D to an A! I purchased an item from a seller who was really bad and because I rushed the transaction a few months later, purchased from the same guy! Bad experience feedback should give one the IMMEDIATE option to block that seller! If was given the option to block that seller I would have never gave him my business again, and worse, put myself at risk of a bad experience which I did have the second time too. The end result in changes like this will be that sellers will do everything in their power not to get blocked and to maintain a high rating next to their name. In NYC food places have ""A to D"" rating outside the business doors so you know what you're getting before you eat their food. If eBay did something similar then you will know what you're getting before you do business with every seller. My days doing business on eBay are surely numbered. It's only a matter of time before I don't visit the site at all. I will probably keep the account open, but I am sure that I will simply not buy from there anymore, or keep it open until I start getting annoying emails telling me that they ""miss me and want me to come back"" and that's when I will delete the account for good! I realize that I don't need them as much as I used to and the headaches, at least right now, far outweigh the benefits. Etsy has been my go-to site on my last 5 purchases and seems like the way to go for now. Ebay needs to get rid of gimmicks and do things that truly protect the buyers. Clarity and real punitive action is the first step. Full disclosure! Show the buyer, immediately who the seller is and how that seller does business! Believe me, do this and things will straighten themselves out in the end!",2,“eBay getting you down? Could be time to Rethink eBay.......”

When postage is $10 for an item & the seller has to pay $10 to send it & then $10 for the return all of a sudden it costs the seller $20 if a buyer wants to return something..for any reason the buyer has with no pictures or evidence or anything..this can get expensive for sellers to ship goods all over the US without collecting any money.  Customer service doesn't care at all about sellers return policy or requesting any evidence from buyers either...they want sellers to eat the costs of returns which is unfair when buyers break the return policy.  A buyer with an address registered to about 50 companies including pawn shops & tax companies did this to me & it appears to be fraudulent or for money laundering purposes & I am not happy with how ebay requires no evidence of damage or something being not as described before allowing the buyer to return the item for a full refund at a $20 expense to the seller.

1014,"A recent experience where I purchased a 'refurbished' PC from a company called pcdeals09 on ebay turned into major problems. The computer OS or HDD failed. I contacted the seller, he offered to send me another HDD with OS. I told him maybe it was only the OS failed proper install, if he could just send me a copy with the activation code and I'd try to install it and see if that fixed it, the computer had Win 10 installed, but had a Win 7 product code on it. He said not possible, he would have to send a HDD with OS. I agreed. After 4 weeks, it still hadn't arrived. I left negative feedback explaining the computer was defective and I ended up buying a HDD from another seller and OS. Of course it was negative. And ebay deleted it.I was not aware that ebay had a policy where they could delete feedback, other than profanity etc. of which there was none. No explanation as to why they deleted it, and I asked.. Apparently certain sellers are allowed to scam their customers. This tells me that ebay feedback cannot be trusted. I know I won't trust it any longer. I should have just opened a case and sent the computer back to start with. I have it fixed now at my own -additional- expense.",2,“Don't trust ebay feedback”

1019,"I placed an offer for a 2007 GMC on eBay. It was promptly declined and followed up with a personal phone call from sales person Jehanzeb Joe Yameen (the used car dealer named Amazing Cars and also Ultiamte Motorsports). Joe indicated that the car was sold (which it wasn't) and then directed me to a 2004 Suburban Z71 that they had in stock. He did not want to do the transaction through eBay/Paypal so they could save commission expenses. 

At the time I relied on their positive eBay reviews, which I now see are incomplete and a false representation of their business. (see additional reviews on BBB, ripoffreport, YP and an enormous amount of negative reviews that are not recommended on Yelp). Jehanzeb Joe Yameen, Umer Omar Haseeb, Farhan Frank Sultan, Sami Hasan, Haq Samira, Cheryl Haseeb, Faisal Ashraf, Mike Hasazada etc operate under several business names including Affordable Sports & Imports, Amazing Cars LLC, Ultimate Automobiles, Ultimate Automobiles of Houston, PSL Autos, Car Champs, Shaz Auto Enterprise and several more. Have fun reading through all of those negative reviews. They also operate out of two addresses, 10311 Altonbury Ln and 12227 Murphy Rd.

I purchased the suburban and it was supposed to be delivered in 5-8 days. It took them THREE weeks to deliver it and so I had it delivered directly to a local car mechanic. The mechanic called me immediately and told me all the monitors/codes/check engine lights had been intentionally cleared and it is highly likely there is something wrong with the vehicle. As well, the spare tire and jack kit are not here. You can see where this is going. Fraud.

Making a long story a little bit shorter - +$5000 later and I still have not even begun to do work on the failing transmission.

1035,"Be very careful, because eBay sometimes deletes negative Feedback for sellers, and you may not see valid negative feedback posted by buyers who were burned by a seller.  Some sellers use eBay to sell ruined products that nobody would ever buy in person.  Sellers also use a ""No Returns"" policy to maximize their ability to unload ruined items, and since eBay's ""guarantee"" is specifically limited, buyers may get stuck with unusable items.  

On several occasions I have purchased pieces of Waterford and Wedgwood, a cashmere scarf, Cutco and other kitchen items, etc., listed as new, perfect, and in excellent condition, only to receive items that had subtle but very significant problems.  They were ruined, due to being scorched, marked, dirty, bent, scratched, shattered internally, had finish issues, or were deemed second quality by their manufacturers for various reasons.  eBay listings state that eBay guarantees items when a seller does not offer returns, but a buyer may not prevail in a claim when something is abnormal, as eBay may deem it to be a ""color"" issue, and they call that buyer's remorse.  When a buyer offers to pay the shipping costs both ways, and the seller refuses to agree to that and refund just the purchase price, you know it's a scam.  That is a seller who is very happy to have unloaded some ruined junk.  

If you do not prevail in a claim, do not file an appeal online, call eBay to file the appeal.  If you file it online, it will be handled by the same type of front-line employee who denied your claim in the first place.  Once an appeal is denied, then even if eBay leadership later says that the case should have been decided in your favor, the case cannot be reopened.  eBay leadership will tell you to contact PayPal.  Plus, if you do not prevail against such a seller, any negative feedback that you post will be deleted by eBay.  In fact, if you even mention the word refund in your negative feedback against a seller who has a ""No Refunds"" policy, eBay will delete it.  Some sellers are pretty good at using eBay's rules to burn buyers, one after another, while maintaining an undeservedly good feedback score.   

Sellers who list items with quality issues sometimes use fuzzy photos to disguise the issues, while those same sellers use clear, enlargeable photos for their items that have no issues.  Yet these differences in listing methods, which facilitate a seller's scams, do not raise red flags with eBay when there is a claim against such a seller.  In addition, even if eBay refunds you for a problem item, the seller may try to draw you into an invalid claim against the US Postal Service, claiming that the abnormality was caused by something that happened in transit.

If you can find the same item on Replacements Ltd., or Amazon, or another site with stronger guarantees, or in person, where you can see what you are buying, you may save yourself a headache by avoiding eBay, because some eBay sellers use the site to scam buyers.",2,“Some sellers use eBay as a dumping ground for ruined goods”

When the estimated delivery date as per the seller was exceeded with no sign of the kit, I opened a dispute (13 April 2016) and the seller responded by sending another package with a new tracking number and I closed the dispute  believing that this time I will receive what I paid for.
Here I have to state that BOTH tracking numbers are completely useless. All it ever tells you is that the package is in transit. It never even arrives at customs in South Africa, let alone are delivered to me. (Tracking numbers: LJ890387596US and LJ899331546US)

1052,"Buyer View:
It's a great place to buy things for a cheaper price than what they'd normally be, but like some have already said, know who you are buying from. Don't go with someone who has a lot of negative reviews [most larger sellers will have some though], and carefully read the listing and know it inside and out, otherwise you could get ripped off. I myself almost got ripped off when purchasing a pair of Ray-Ban aviator sunglasses. The seller seemed fine and the listing explicitly stated that they were a genuine pair of Ray-Ban, because of how often Ray-Bans are counterfeited, I took a screenshot and video of the listing in case any issues arose. The best decision I did. After a few fishy things happening, I received the sunglasses and saw immediately  that they were fakes. Luckily, eBay gave me no trouble and promptly gave me a refund. The downside? Because eBay removed the listing I was unable to give the seller the negative review he deserved. Moral of the story? If you are going to eBay to find something for less that is a very popular item, Ray-Ban sunglasses for one, know what a fake and genuine pair look like, read the listing very carefully, take screenshots of the listing right before you buy so you have proof, and investigate the seller. 
Also, don't go reading the positive reviews about a seller, read the negative ones, they're what really tell you the story. Even if a seller has a lot of positive reviews, see why they have any negative reviews in the first place, see, if they don't hide the item, if it's an item you're thinking of getting also.

So yeah, it's a good place to buy things, but just keep in mind it's like any cheaper end shop where you can get a deal, shop carefully and read everything carefully. Also, take screenshots because they may come in handy, video if you really want to.

Seller View:
It's okay to be the seller, but sometimes it sucks $#*!, not going to lie. Why? Well, let's start with basics, you can't freaking give a buyer a negative review, even if the buyer was terrible to deal with, ONLY buyers can give negative reviews to seller. What a bunch of $#*!. -_- Like what the heck? Oh, and I don't wanna hear everybody's stuff about how that's totally fair, it's not. How is it fair that a seller can't warn other sellers about how $#*!ty some buyer may be, but if some buyer gets their pants in a bunch, for no reason, they can give a seller a negative review. So as a seller, it can REALLY suck from that angle. In terms of other aspects, I sold something, person said they never got it, even though I know they did, so the hell to all those people saying eBay is ONLY seller savvy, nope, not always.

Also, like all selling places, they'll take a chunk of your profits, yeah.... [not too much, but still] So it's a nice place to sell things, just know, if you have an issue with a seller be ready for many issues because eBay will almost always side with the buyer and the buyer has all the power to screw up your rating....

1054,"What once was a fun and charming way to garage sale anywhere on the planet has become a red-flag version of low-end retail:

1)  It's cheap, meant in the sense that it's evolved into the Jerry Springer of web sales and purchases.  Cool finds are almost impossible anymore on eBay.    

2)  It's expensive.  If you're a buyer, there is a very good chance you'll find the same item for LESS elsewhere.  EBay is no longer a bargain.  Ridiculously-inflated goods, scam-price shipping, and eBay ""fees"" are a joke.  Shop around and see.  

3)  If you're a seller who's recently cleaned out Grandma's attic and have found a few treasures, eBay is no longer the place to cash in.  Polls of legitimate sellers (the original tag sale-type sellers) have moved on, finding eBay isn't the place to offer goods, and replaced by sellers who have 'stores"" with some high-priced overseas junk.  The format that charmed us all in the beginning has evolved into something much less appealing.  Nothing sells on eBay the way it used to.  Not only will you be left with the item you tried to sell (and relist over and over following eBay's dumb ""suggestions""), you'll also be left with charming fees.  

4)  US Selling/Purchasing:  Looking for something but want to filter out overseas items?  Don't bother.  EBay is either just fine with overseas merchants scamming the system into being able to list, OR, they don't have the intelligence or technology to filter them out.  Either way, if you're trying to find items sold in the US, you won't be able to filter out those who should not be listed. 

5)  Support.  Seriously, there is none.  Try to find a meaningful link for help.  Like the proverbial rabbit hole, each link brings you to another link, and then another, and then, well by that time, you think the FAQs simply MUST have some help but it's all just general junk questions.  If you're looking for a real person to online chat with or, heaven forbid, an actual phone number to call, just give up now and quit trying. 

6)  Bottom Line:  That's all it is for eBay CEOs.  They're living off the original hype and not improving the experience.  What initially was a refreshing, fun experience is, at best, a disappointment.",2,“DAYS OF EBAY ARE OVER”

1056,"My name is John and I live humbly in Los Angeles. Normally I dont write reviews but Im doing this to send the message out and to warn all the Ebay buyers out there. I hope my testify reach out to many so that no one would have the same bad experiences as I did. I have saved emails and the bad item that I received from the seller as evidences and Im willing to share them if needed.

So heres my story On 12/3/2015, I ordered an item($53 worth) from ""superbeam20"" in Ebay. On 12/27/15, I received the item and only found out it was wrapped up in a cheap plastic bag, the item was horribly made, and it had many scratches on. This item was to never to leave their facility and belonged in a trash can instead. I was so disappointed that, for the first time in my Ebay life, I left a negative review on the seller for selling me a horrible product. And I also contacted the seller (superbeam20) to inform the issue and requested a replacement. They contacted me right away and they asked me to change my negative review to positive in exchange for a replacement. So I trusted them and I did so (Mistake #1). After some email exchanges, on 1/6/2016, finally the seller claimed that they sent the replacement, so I believed without asking for the tracking # (Mistake #2). I waited patiently for over a month, and on 2/10/16, since still no luck of receiving it, I contacted them about the status. They kept telling me all these excuses of Chinese New Year and talk to your post office bra bra and made me to wait a little bit longer, so I waited (Mistake #3). On 2/15/16, still no replacement so I contacted them and they gave me a tracking #. But it was not a working # nor was trackable. I finally lost my patient and told them I would wait for another week and if I dont receive it by then, I would have to ask for the refund. On 2/25/16, up on my request, the seller agreed that they would get me the refund within 24hrs so I believed (Mistake #4). After waiting for another 3 days without the refund, the seller only gave me lame excuses as usual. On 3/1/16, I contacted Ebay and Paypal to step in. Ebay told me that they can no longer help me out since 30-day term has passed and also I was told that I could not reverse my review on the seller since I already changed the review on them before. Sucks. On 3/2/16, Paypal was able to help out since they have a 6-months term. So Paypal stepped in and requested the refund for me. Then all the sudden, the seller was now requesting that I need to return the bad item in order to receive the refund. And I was also told that I have to pay for the return shipping. What??!!! On 3/3/16, I found out it was $88 to send it back to China with tracking # on it. Got screwed big time. :( I called Paypal one last time to explain the whole story and they felt sympathy over me and generously offered me a first timer break and got my full refund back from their own pocket. Thank God! And thank you Paypal! The Paypal guy also told me that I should do a little more researches before conducting any businesses with the sellers from China. I told the Paypal guy, After all the troubles I went through, you made my day today! Once again, Thank You Paypal! And SHAME ON YOU superbeam20! Hope this testify reach out to many for good.

1076,"Do NOT use eBay for your regular purchases! Most of them are not a good deal. Just drive that extra mile to go to a larger city so you can get the items instead. You will pay the same or even less if you just go to a physical store. And if you have car trouble, they sell car parts on ebay which is usually pretty good. I even found a replacement car hood really cheap including shipping. They probably sold it at a loss. I buy gift cards and reloadable cards on ebay. No problem there either. I have bought vitamins, including vitamins for my guinea pigs and they ship no problem. Buy anything in bulk and it will ship no problem. Buy a heavy item and it will ship no problem. Buy a rare item and it will ship no problem. Buy an expensive item and it will ship no problem. HOWEVER, you have to contact the seller and REQUEST that it be delivered directly to your door. I find that USPS rarely does this. On the contrary the USPS usually LOSE my packages! Apparently it is not the seller's fault as long as they mail it. Most Cheapskate and sometimes Ghetto sellers refuse to ship UPS, even if I agree to pay extra shipping. eBay used to specify which shipping carrier the seller uses, but now it just says ""Standard Shipping"", ""Expedited Shipping"" etc. with no mention of the carrier. It is up to the Seller whether or not to even put that information! All the items I mentioned will usually ship UPS or FedEx, delivered directly to your door without any problems. The rest of the items, DON'T EVEN BOTHER. And the auctions are rigged! Make sure you have signed up for a free UPS account (they will bill you for various services requested) and if they ship UPS Sure Post that means USPS so make sure you upgrade it to UPS Ground. I had bought some items on ebay and requested ""2 Day Air"" which used to be UPS but they decided to ship with UPS Sure Post. They took my shipping money and ran with it!

1077,"I've been on eBay for a long time since the late 1990's.  Starting off as a buyer and several years later as both a buyer and seller.  Here are a few of my gripes:

1. Buying stuff from a seller at times leads to a great amount of aggravation.  Many sellers are not sophisticated people; to be generous, I'd say some sellers are truly morons.  You'll find sellers without any sense of applying good business practices.  Because of the mental ineptitude or the basic criminal minds of some sellers, buying from Amazon might be a preferred purchasing method in order to avoid buying aggravations.

Here's an example of a purchasing problem my wife recently experienced.  She bid on a second-hand, small mirror priced at under $10 which had a shipping cost listed as $40; and she didn't observe the $40 shipping cost when she placed the bid.  The actual cost to ship this small mirror probably would cost about $5 to $10 (maximum).  In essence, the seller was attempting to ""pull a fast one"" on my wife.  The seller admitted the shipping cost mistake but demanded my wife pay the $40 shipping cost, which the seller said would refund the difference between the $40 and the actual shipping cost.  My wife refused to hand over the $40 for shipping costs because the seller refused to rebill her for the actual shipping cost.  This turned into a lot of back-and-forth seller/buyer communications which the seller showed her true colors ... and a very ""dark"" color, indeed a crook.  The obnoxious seller was ugly and created a lot of aggravation.  Turns out the eBay seller was ""new"" without any negative feedback; a big surprise.  I would highly recommend you first buy things from Amazon, if possible ... definitely more sophisticated sellers at Amazon for new product items.  But when buying old stuff, that's where you have a good chance of buying crappy stuff on eBay.

2.  Now a more recent problem with eBay is the complaint contact method with the company.  Once you could use e-mail and have a written record of complaints filed.  Now eBay does everything with phone contact.  The problem with phone contacts is the lack of having a written record, but instead being guided by an eBay representative that doesn't know what they are doing.  In fact, you may be guided outside the policy rules that eBay supposedly governs.

3.  Another issue is that the bad sellers (the ""crook"" types) continue selling on eBay.  EBay does settle quickly in your favor to refund the cost of a bad product.  But ... you'll later see the same high volume, junk selling crook flooding the marketplace with crap.  So you'll go through a miserable buying experience and so will others in the near future.  By the way, I've noticed this situation to be true on Amazon, too.  Have had the exact same negative experiences with both companies.

4.  What's interesting is when I just happened to purchase the same item from both an Amazon and an eBay seller.  I had purchased an item from Amazon that was not as advertised.  I needed this item ASAP, so I happened to see the same item on eBay unknowingly it was from the same seller ... oh crap!  So both purchases were from the same seller and both times shipped the wrong item.  It was obviously the seller was dumping it's inventory.  The fact the first time I confronted the seller on Amazon made no difference when I once again received the same, wrong item on eBay.  Because this particular seller was a high volume mover on both Amazon and eBay, I made an interesting observation of the quantity of negative feedbacks left on Amazon and eBay.  First of all, this seller didn't have a pristine selling history review on either Amazon and eBay.  But I examined in depth the volume of negative feedbacks left on both Amazon and eBay.  For a given time period, Amazon recorded a much larger number of negative feedback complaints than eBay ... about a four-to-one difference.  So I have to ask, ""Why does eBay show much fewer negative feedbacks?""

5.  Another problem you can experience from a seller is their very poor packaging of an item.  If you don't return a damaged item, then you're screwed.  Items costing below $100 simply aren't worth my time to return, so I ""eat"" the item I purchased.  I recently tossed (in late 2015) an old printer into the trashcan I received; virtually no packing material was used by the seller.  Might as well have placed a shipping label directly to the printer, no box needed.

The above reminds me of the time I purchased an inexpensive (Made in China) impact drill from Amazon.  When I plugged it into the power outlet, it smoked.  This piece-of-junk was transferred to the trashcan without hesitation.  It's the time period we live in ... a lack of human consciousness reigns.

6.  An early 2016 year purchase problem was an inaccurate description of an item.  Pictures of the item did not show cosmetic flaws.  It was described as ""cosmetically perfect.""  The item has a plastic cover containing micro cracks and a chip which can't be cosmetically repaired.  Well, this seller obviously had a high threshold of when he thought an item contained flaws.  So when I received the item, I filed an eBay complaint.  I told the seller to knock off $25 on the purchase price, otherwise send me a return shipping label.  Seller accepted the $25 refund.  Of recent, I'm running into more eBay purchase problems due to inept or dishonest sellers; buyers beware!

I've had mostly good luck with eBay over the years considering the volume of stuff I've purchased (and sold).  Have purchased up to four-figure items and sold many four-figure items and sold a few five-figure items.  But all it takes is a few bad deals to make life a bit more miserable!",2,“Problems I Have With eBay” 
1078,"I'm not very happy with their service. There are lots of sellers who have high rank, but still in reality they never send it to me the paid order I've made.",2,“Not best service!” 
1079,"Ever hear of Ali-Expess.com? Well, it's China's e-bay or so like it, but BIGGER! Did you know that e-bay is just a pawn in the game of chess? Ever wonder how new items are so cheap and you can't afford to sell yours for a profit? China produces about 70% of all manufacturing that comes to us in the U.S. There is a conglomeracy of China products based in California that China sellers use from a HUGE warehouse so they can ship items on e-bay faster rather than from China, a new one but much smaller has opened up here in N.Y. After doing much research, I now use ebids.net to sell on and Ali-express.com to buy from, ordering direct and bargaining with the seller using e-bay as a tool. E-bay is just another middleman who has gotten too big for their britches, making money buying and selling products on their website. Amazon is a true leader in selling products and is U.S. not from China based. E-bay is just another website that does not care about you or me but still must not conform to regulations as they hold themselves not responsible as per their agreement policy. We can complain all we want and lose money to e-bay but, it is up to us to do our homework and look out for ourselves. Shop around people, make offers to sellers privately and sell on the 2nd biggest selling site to help e-bay monopoly. Wall-mart has the best prices if you settle for their brands and Ali-express if you can wait the extra time on shipping putting the big time sellers out of business. P.S. China will sell from their warehouses but will not let us use them in the United States. To buy quantity, use Alibaba.com and warehouse yourself if you have the room.

I sent in an email to change my bank listing information where they would be sending payments.

This is sketchy at best as the woman did not indicate this was why she was calling. With all the scam artists calling to try to steal info out there they need to  train people better on how to reassure people they are calling that who they are and why they are calling. Or maybe send an email indicating how we will know what to expect or to even expect a phone call to begin with. I explained my situation to the agent who did not understand what I was saying. She basically kept repeating herself as if reading from a book indicating how to respond to certain questions. Like talking to a poorly programmed robot. Asked to speak to a supervisor who understood what I was asking but was horribly rigid about the rules. When I explained that my old bank account still exists but is no longer in my name she explained there was nothing they could do and I should call the bank to have them transfer, except my new account is not w/ the same bank.

The delivery status was both packages were delivered on such and such date at such and such time ( I signed for them) ,so it couldent have been any other seller as they were the only ones I bought roses from at that time.  They sent me 30 white in a box which was fine and like I ordered, but the second package was 48 like I ordered but WHITE. These flowers I needed for my boquet for my wedding in 2 months time!!! When I tried to sort it out with them the gave me the run around. Told me they would send me the 48 red fake roses free of charge if I sent them pictures to prove that they were all white. Ok fine so I did. Then they told me to take more pictures to make sure the numbers were right. Ok fine did that. Then they asked me if I bought from another seller which at this point its been a week/week and a half of this so I ordered a few red roses (50 red from one other seller and 12 red from another seller )because Im not going without flowers for my wedding. So I took some pictures of my orders and delivery times for all the rose orders I placed. Theirs were still the only ones I had received at that time and the dates/times of delivery matched up with theyre delivery dates as posted from the post office plus they were the only ones I ordered those amounts of each color( 30 white and 48 red) and I received 30 white in a box and 48 white again in a bag. Now I could understand if I ordered those amounts from someone else but I didnt. Anyways I sent them pictures to prove it and then they say they dont think the ones in the box are theirs ( the ones in the box are the right amount and the right color its the ones in the bag thats the damn issue!!! Wtf!!! Then they try to say they think they sent red ones! After all that ... My multiple pictures proving I have not received one damn red flower from anyone yet, my pictures of delivery dates and who I bought what and how many from, and my waiting 2 weeks just to have NOTHING SORTED OUT YET!! At this point I gave up and told them to pretty much shove it where the sun dont  shine. DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM!! The flowers are nice but they cant get a damn order right and wont do anything to fix the mistakes that they make!",2,“Beware of seller Sashecc!! They are two faced liers!” 
1087,"Was very excited upon first selling on their platform. Easy, quick & no hassle. Lately, they have started to decline with less and less protection for sellers.

1091,"I was a seller & buyer on eBay for years until one day a seller had produced an image of a product that I needed, but the description was wrong, so I never proceeded with the sale. Like any shop cart right? If you don't process payment, you don't get charged. Not on ebay! They try to force you to purchase the product, meanwhile charging your card every month a small amount, for Lord only knows why. So you can have the account for years, not sell or buy anything, and they charge you. They also refuse to credit your account when you have proof of trying to cancel the account months ago ... I would highly discourage ANYONE from this place. They use people that barely speak English, and essentially have made up their own rules that are not in the best interest of buyers. Run away from setting up an account. There are other places to get good deals on the net that don't pull unethical moves on you, trust me.",2,“eBay makes it difficult to cancel and charges you” 
1092,"Ebay used to be the best place to buy and sell on the internet. In the last few years it has gone downhill for both sellers and buyers as well.

Ebay's rules and philosophy that they can run the business better than the seller is causing good sellers to leave in droves. With their restrictions and high fees it is almost impossible to make a profit as a seller on Ebay anymore. They are kicking out all the small sellers with collectible and one of a kind items and promoting the large sellers specifically those from China with cheap imitation goods. 

The buyers are having a hard time on Ebay as well as most of the older more experienced sellers are either moving on or diversifying and putting all their good items elsewhere. Ebay has become the yard sale place and the place of inferior quality cheap Chinese goods. Not only that but buyers have to contend with new sellers taking the place of the older experienced ones and they do not have the experience to run a great customer oriented business. 

What used to be a great place to buy and sell is now a shell of it's former self and is losing ground everyday. It has become nothing but a yard sale.",2,"“Ebay is going downhill, losing sellers and buyers” "

1094,"http://www.ebay.com/usr/odem_nowadays
Received my second order from Odem_nowadays shop in Ebay and gave 2 positive, one neutral and one negative comment on the 4 items received. That was due to one item bent due to having been packed folded, not enough padding for the items, so the bag had torn, and slightly slow shipment. They kindly offered to refund the bent item, and I revised my rating for the item to positive. Otherwise the items were nice quality, just as promised, and the price was good.

Never received my fist order of 5 items, that had already shipped prior to me placing the second order. After 30+ days' wait and then a month of many emails nothing was done by them to correct the issue, but they kept hinting that they could not help because I had not given fully positive review to them, and as a small company they need and deserve perfect reviews. I could not change the review afterwards to an unrelated order and cannot see the relevance. They seemed to suggest that maybe both orders had been shipped together, but the shipping notice for the first order was prior to placing the second order. Gave me a promise a few times to reship the order and twice to refund within 48 hours, but nothing happened as time passed by. Got refund from Paypal.

They still bothered to send me a message to say that it is important not to leave any negative or neutral feedback/review for them for the order that I never received.

Free shipping does not really benefit either the customer or seller. The estimated cost must be added to item price for the business to survive, but not specifying the shipping cost as a part of the total cost makes the customs fees and duties higher for the buyer. As a buyer I would be encouraged to make only small orders, below the dutiable value, which causes added work and cost for the seller. 

Well, on the other hand I would not place any large order to a seller that I have not found reliable. And sad to say, this shop was not reliable. 

Lots of nonsense and trouble. No option for tracking number for shipment.

Ebay itself is a great concept. Customer service only reachable by phone, and resolutions only available via Paypal. All depends on if the seller is reliable.",2,“http://www.ebay.com/usr/odem_nowadays” 
1095,"I have been selling on Ebay for several years now. When I First started out, buyers tried their best to take advantage of me as a new comer. When I showed them better than tell them, I was not that dumb, things changed. I had worked hard to be an honest seller and it seemed no matter what I did, it wasn't good enough. I endured enormous stress to start. After selling for over a year I have sold approx.. 6,000 maybe, and of that amount have lost well over $5000. I have given away most of my items, due to outrageous fees, shipping cost, and so forth. I wonder why I am still selling on Ebay.com. Well the truth is, so far Ebay.com is one of the top sites for sellers to unload their products, but many people are fed up, including local businesses who I have spoken to recently who said they are about to close their accounts because Ebay.com is out for themselves, gives the sellers who earn their money for them crap, no respect, no rights, and the buyers can walk all over the sellers as they choose. I give Ebay.com one star recently because they are making improvements it seems, I just wonder who is going to benefit from those improvements.

1097,at this time I left this sellor a review that I felt that he desired. a netural. I did not feel that he communicated very well with me during our transaction. And that is why I left him a neutral feed back score on his sight. He sent me an email that he would block me from buying from him in the future. I feel he was very unprofessional in his actions. if he is going to block someone from buying from him in the future for any reason he should just go ahead and do it and not bother telling the buyer that he is doing so. Especially since it was only because of the feed back that I gave to him. I also felt he was only interested in the gettting more ebay points  rather than to communicate better with his buyers.

1099,"Well I am very disappointed in eBay personally.  Years back I was both a buyer on eBay and when I sold my one home sold hundreds of items on eBay because I collected certain things.  I recently sold my other home and have a lot of items to sell.   Out of hundreds I had two buyers who failed to read the ad on an item they bought and was not happy.  When I pointed out the ad they both admitted their mistake.   I would have been at 100% with A+ responses from hundreds of buyers.   Now I go to my old account and I start selling items I no longer needed at my new home.   Within 3 items I hit a limit.   ""A Limit""??  I never had a limit before.   It looks like I have to earn the right to do business with eBay.   Well it appears eBay puts a limit on sellers until they ""prove themselves"".  I am a person of honor and proved myself past I feel.  So here I set with hundreds of items and no place to sell them,  and have to look elsewhere.  So I guess eBay does not need my commissions.   They lost my respect,  and pretty much said my past performance means nothing to them.   I will find other means to sell my antiques and collections.    It is not as if their fees are cheap to begin with.",2,“Well I am very disappointed in eBay personally”

1111,"It would be difficult to recommend EBay to anyone. In the past year the site has become even more anti-seller than before (and I think they often don't support the good buyers who are not scammers but honestly trying to resolve issues).  If a site is anti seller it is also anti buyer.  EBay customer service is a joke...they're in some -istan nation and often do not speak English as a first or even second language.  EBay employs all these people...overseas, for pennies.  At the same time, EBay has become very inhospitable to small sellers by limiting views of their items so that even though sellers pay to list things, EBay's most recent user agreement states they ""may not"" show in searches!  That has to be fraud!  Not to mention Paypal, owned by EBay, which freezes people's funds not only in Paypal accounts but in bank accounts linked to Paypal, for 21 days and longer.  That has to be against the law!  In a stunning purge of small sellers last year, EBay with no notice at all closed the accounts of over 15,000 small sellers. This is outrageous. This is during a recession, when so many depend on the business they do on EBay to pay for groceries. Apparently this was the result of a computer program designed to clean house but as is often the case, many who had done nothing to deserve this were swept up in the mess. EBay remains completely unaccountable and people had no appeal or recourse. They could not complete sales which were made, they couldn't tie up loose ends...they went from heroes to bad people in one fell swoop.  EBay has made it clear that it has an agenda to support big box sellers and Chinese manufacturers (who do not compete fairly because of cheaper postage rates and other trade agreement benefits).  EBay no longer wants small sellers.  They have treated them with disdain. EBay is no longer a good place to do business.  Sales are down for most small sellers because EBay limits the search views to favoured (big box) sellers. EBay also in a cheap move stopped paying Google for as much access, cutting their sellers off at the knees (while charging them more).  Because of the flawed Detailed Seller Rating system, sellers are often victimised by unscrupulous buyers who have become savvy in the ways of EBunk ... they know that EBay will side with them against sellers every time.  Sellers who want to maintain their high feedback (without which they too will be purged) must often knuckle under to sellers who demand ""partial refunds"" (i.e., discounts) and who rant against an item (often before it has been delivered) and then when offered ""return for refund"" do not take it (all they wanted was a bribe).  To be fair, most buyers on EBay are good ....it's just that the scammers have been enabled by EBay and now are rife there.  EBay was once a wonderful place but since it was taken over by John Donahoe (formerly of Bain Capital) it has been turned into something different....and is no longer friendly and hospitable terrain.  I'm saddened to have to be less than optimistic but the changes especially in the past year leave EBay watchers dismayed and do not hold out much hope for a good future there.  Look for it to be another place to buy whatever they sell at Walmart and not much else.  Don't get used to caring, nice small sellers...their days are numbered.",2,“It would be difficult to recommend EBay to anyone” 
1112,"Ebay is great for a buyer. I love buying on ebay. 

It is bad for small sellers. I've sold on ebay myself since 1999 and I find the friendly atmosphere and feeling of community you used to feel there has been on a rapid decline since about 2008. 

My biggest beef is that there is no more authentic feedback system. A positive feedback left for a seller may not even be positive due to the detailed seller ratings star system. Most buyers probably do not know how much damage they are causing to a sellers account when leaving these 1 and 2 stars, and probably do it unwittingly. They don't MEAN to cause damage, but they do. 

After three 1 or 2 star ratings, a seller can and probably will be banned, even with a 100% positive feedback rating. 

Sellers are not allowed to leave anything but a positive feedback for a buyer, even if a buyer was difficult, abusive, unreasonable or did not pay, so there's no warnings for other sellers to heed. If you leave a message about the buyer in feedback that is less than glowing, ebay will sometimes remove it and warn you.

The last line of defense for a seller these days is to ban certain buyers manually, problem is, when you figure out who to ban, it's usually too late - they've already ruined your DSR or cost you in fees when you have to re-list what they didn't pay for.",2,“Ebay is great for a buyer”

I have still been scammed once many years ago (when most payments were made via Money Order), but 99% of my purchases have gone smoothly. So why the two star rating? Stephen P nailed it in his review. Buyers have so much protection now that it has gone from sellers scamming buyers to buyers scamming sellers. I had a 100% feedback rating with thousands of sales and then ebay changed many of their policies in favor of the buyer. Suddenly I was having buyers try and extort money out of me, telling me if I didn't send money to their Paypal account that they would leave negative feedback or claim they never received the item and due to ebays new policies I, as a seller, was powerless to do anything about it. I did not give in to the extortionists and as a result my feedback rating dropped, and as a result of that bidding on my items decreased. All of that along with the huge increases in ebay and PayPal fees caused me to finally close my ebay account after 15 years.

(Wikipedia is a great source of information which I shall credit with some of the info in this review.) Ebay and its powerhouse offspring (that is fast outgrowing its ageing parent), Paypal, seem to be guilty of the above. (One cannot talk about Ebay without referring to Paypal, Ebay's ""unfair advantage"".) Notice how they change rules unilaterally without consultation with or regard for those who contribute so much to their success - e.g. requiring every seller in Australia and UK to accept Paypal; and taking away the rights of sellers to leave negative feedback for buyers, no matter how criminal or perverse their behaviour. Some of these rules could well fall foul of unfair contract laws - but with their deep combined pockets and army of legal minds, they are understandably not particularly perturbed by individual action. When Paypal moved from the UK to Luxembourg in 2007, they removed themselves from the relatively conscientious and onerous jurisdiction of the FSA and with it, the English, Welsh and Scottish courts. 

Ebay and Paypal may think that they are too big to fail, but the welter of disenfranchisement among its user community remains very much a reality. (There are websites dedicated to the downfall of these monolithic entities.) To Paypal's credit, it has not just survived but thrived whilst others e.g. BidPay and PayDirect, have bitten the dust. For all intents and purposes, Paypal is a monopolist that is getting bigger by the day. Perhaps it's time the M&MC checked it out.

I have been an 'ebayer' since early 2000 but am now looking for alternatives. Ebay and Paypal are very friendly to buyers but sellers (especially newbies) have a tougher time. I have noticed that some superb sellers I have often bought from in the past - who have had thousands of feedback - are no longer on ebay. Happily, I have managed to track down their own websites... When there are problems, getting through to Ebay/Paypal can be a grind. There are times I have called during their office hours only to hear (after having laboriously obtained and entered the PIN number, etc etc) ""your call cannot be taken at this time...""!! Messages left verbally or through their messaging system (and email) not infrequently get lost in transit (or translation??). 

Even though Ebay/Paypal are huge organisations, a bit of personal touch from well-trained and empowered staff and some situation-specific flexibility (followed by fine-tuning of their systems) would certainly pay dividends in improving customer affection, referrals and loyalty (which immensely reduce cost of sales).

1136,"Well, when eBay first started they were 100% in my book. But not recently, i.e., the last few years.... eBay has been allowing foreign counterfeit designer labels to get right through. And I've learned my lesson from buying through iOffer, which seems to be like the fake designer shopping site of the world, that counterfeit designer products are cheap, smelly, low quality, and look nothing like the photos, description, let alone the real thing. For example, this seller has been trying to sell what they are describing as an authentic COACH (rare, too) handbaghttp://cgi.ebay.com/COACH-Bonnie-Jeweled-Canvas-Caryall-Tote-Purse-Bag-NEW_W0QQitemZ300507989190QQcategoryZ63852QQcmdZViewItemQQ_trksidZp5197.m7QQ_trkparmsZalgo%3DLVI%26itu%3DUCI%26otn%3D1%26po%3DLVI%26ps%3D63%26clkid%3D7301249094219903584#ht_2552wt_1141
without any photos of the exact handbag, they're using stock photos. They mentioned they ""mutilated the price tag,"" hmm, maybe because it is not a real price tag? They also said ""I am in no way affiliated with Louis Vuitton"" yet they are selling a ""COACH"" product. Reeks of scam to me! But of course, no matter how many times I report it to eBay, eBay does nothing.
Anyway, I'm digressing. I have been a buyer and a seller on eBay since the year 2005. When I am selling, I get charged too many fees, so I make the same profit as I would at a garage sale. When I am buying, I am usually paying full retail price for used stuff! The sellers seem to *have* to jack the prices up in order to make a garage-sale profit! I've also gotten ripped off as a seller - I sold a girl some shoes which were brand new, in the box the box was packaged within a shipping box, and insured. She wanted a refund and to keep my shoes too. eBay recommended in the Resolution Center that I only refund her if she sends the shoes back to me. She refused. I did get to keep my profit, and she got to keep my shoes, plus eBay refunded her too because they found ""neither party at fault."" Okay eBay, if you have the cash to fork over to scammers like her, it's your loss. But what does eBay care? They make up for it bigtime in fees. And that's not to mention Paypal fees. I don't buy often on eBay but when I do I have to put extra effort into making sure I'm not getting ripped off...which is a lot lately. My advice is if you're selling take insane amounts of photos of your product, and take photos of the packaging process too. If you're a buyer ask for close up (macro) shots of some of the fine detail of the product. This is good for some designer labels that won't authenticate their products. If you get photos of a genuine product and receive a fake product, you can take close-up shots of the fake product's detail and hold it against the detailed photos of the product you thought you were getting.

Ebay pays a similar percentage of tax as amazon, so in principle it's no better, but the overall business is smaller than amazon, so the actual £profit and numbers are lower

Paypal (owned by ebay) is an utter cash cow. Taking a chunk of all payments. Like I said...ebay/paypal need competition

There is something slightly more insidious about ebay. Take hiking shoes for example. unless you have a brand you know and love, there is a lot of low quality rubbish for sale. This means items that should last, end up being consumables (6 month life span for a pair of shoes). this can't be good for the environment... (but who cares about the environment? it's all about profit from selling things).

Ebay has been taken over.  They are catering to the big corporations and drop shippers, each of whom sells tens of thousands of items, if not hundreds of thousands. These businesses are ruining ebay because they flood the search pages with thousands of identical  duplicate listings that may vary in price by a few pennies, or just a letter or two in the title. It is near impossible to compete as a seller in a market that is saturated with cheaper quality items that always seem to be at the top of the search results, but in a way, that competition makes it a good site to buy on. But check Amazon before buying on ebay, because many of the big sellers and drop shippers are using ebay to list their items and then have them shipped through  their Amazon Prime accounts. Of course, in cases like that, the ebay prices will be a few dollars more than Amazon. Maybe they will merge someday. Another thing I feel happening on ebay is that the seller is gradually losing control over how they run their business on ebay. Rules and regulations, and even more rules and regulations. And the fees! If they raise them again anytime soon, I think that the smaller sellers will begin to leave in waves and then ebay would become something like an online Walmart, a truly irrelevant online marketplace.

Unless of course you buy from China, which is the majority of sellers, than you can get a fantastic deal, but it is from China, so most likely to be low quality and a two month wait to receive if you receive it.

1156,"Depending on what I use Ebay for my experiences vary wildly. 

First, the good: the site is fairly easy to use, you can set up an ad and sell your unwanted stuff or take it a step further. It used to be a bit easier before they set their ridiculous standard of 500 pix minimum for pictures (yes, I like clear photos, but zooming in a tad further on some would get you more info). If an ad has a bad photo you can always ask to clarify. With a standard, unpaid account you get 50 listings free (auction or buy it now) which is nice.

The bad: Yes, there are some scammer out there on both sides of the spectrum (I buy and sell there myself, so I have seen both). I strongly suspect the site has an algorithm working for it as well; if it suspects it can sell you something say goodbye to ever getting any 'extra' free ad space. I keep my buying separate from my selling (allowed) and I get free listing offers on my buying account all the time which are never mirrored on my selling account (which I don't use). And I do mean NEVER.

The ugly: customer service. Good God, the customer service. As a seller, no matter what the issue, just save yourself the aggravation and don't call them unless you have a couple of hours to spare and are prepared to take it to the top. The 'seller protection' means nothing, that's just a marketing trick. Don't fall for the 'we'll call you back' either; believe me, they won't and you will have to start all over again. Honestly... there is no service there.

Every time I spoke with them they would say they had my back and that this is a clear case of buyers remorse.   They would say they will not honor the return and I did everything I was supposed to do and more. Every time I called they would tell me one thing and the next couple of days I would see on my account that the complete opposite would happen.  In the end after being lied to so many times, the buyer was refunded and kept the product.  So i lost $70 and my merchandise.

The fees to sell have risen drastically and the buyer has all of the rights, the seller none.

The feedback system is a great idea-those of you who are complaining about things you have purchased need to look closer at a seller's feed back and actually read the comments before you buy.  I have virtually never received anything I've purchased that hasn't been exactly as described.

And finally, like most companies who are ""too big to care"", it is virtually impossible to contact a real human being for issues and questions.

Once a buyer states this as a reason for return, it automatically means the seller pays for return shipping. A buyer can be a nightmare and no way to let the public know because no negatives or even neutral is able to be given to a buyer. I have sold one item that I know was working and the buyer claimed it did not. When they returned the heavy item (lots of return postage I had to pay) I got back a DIFFERENT item than the one I shipped out. However eBay still gave them their money and I was left with a damaged non working item AND my money. Recently someone claimed I sent a different item than the one in the listing claiming ""the stitching looks different"". I had no similar item so no way that was possible.

1181,50% of the time buying on Ebay is smooth and problem free but the rest of the time it is a nightmare. Frequently items are not as described in particular with car and car parts. A friend won a Mazda MX5 and when we went to collect it it was a pile of s**t! Obviously my friend told the seller what to do with their car and was then described when the seller readvertised as a timewaster. Another time I asked for delivery to be made to another address and the package was dumped on my doorstep when I was away - failures by both the seller and the courier! Another seller said that I had not paid and Ebay by default seem to believe the seller rather than trying to establish the facts - this also closed my PayPal account.

I still ended up paying the shipping for the return eve though the mdse. was damaged. 
However, she was the only seller I've had problems with and eBay needs to leave sellers an opportunity to leave feedback for the customer/buyer. 
It's gotten easier to find things on Amazon and Etsy than eBay because on both of those sites especially Etsy you can communicate with the seller without Etsy looking over your shoulder. 
eBay doesn't allow you to communicate with a seller unless it's strictly through them, and it infuriates me. I once had someone I bought mdse. from and she (seller) also was a painter. I just accidentally discovered it by telling her I was using frames she was selling me for some of my great,great aunt's drawings. So I found out she was a painter, and I wanted to see some pictures of her work. Well eBay would not allow us to exchange emails so I could view some of her work.

I tried everything. Even contacted the USPS and had no luck. Point is that I struggled so much to make a simple change. I was so frustrated and just wanted my money back. But then I tried one last thing. I contacted the seller and fortunately he was able to edit my shipping address and apologized for the inconvenience.
	When I finally received my package I was relieved. Utterly relieved! I really liked my case, not so much the keyboard.

That said making the buyer return goods that simply don't match what was offered and at their expense is not on.If the seller wants their questionable items back it should be on them to meet the cost. Assuming of course the buyer can prove his/her case and this is not normally not that hard.

So much so I'm for the most part no longer willing to buy goods from this region.. By contrast UK/US sellers seem to be for the most part honest and I have rarely had reason to doubt them.

1231,"To many people out there who seek to buy an item for a lesser price than average, there can only be two options: stealing, or the more legal approach, eBay.

I've been an eBay buyer and seller since 2009 and have always used it as my source of secondary income or to find items for considerably less. It's been a good run so far and the fact that my product is exposed to a worldwide audience is what captivates me about the power of the internet. I list an item, within a couple days it sells, I get paid, I ship the item out, I get reviewed, and I build up my reputation with my expertise in sales. 

Now, why the 3 star review and not 5?

Although eBay is great for both the seller and buyer, it is tough to begin with. I'm not talking about listing the product and trying to get it out there, no. EBay has made it very easy for beginning sellers or buyers to buy/sell items all around with basic buttons and listing tools as well more advanced options for experienced sellers. I'm talking about their fees and their ""protection"" plans.

Ebay takes 10 percent of whatever value you sell your product for, up to a maximum of a $250 fee (ex. I sell a product for $100, eBay takes $10. I sell a product for $2500, eBay takes $250. I sell a product for $2501 or higher, eBay still takes $250). Not bad considering it's an auction site when most auctions charge upwards of 20-30 percent of your items final selling price. 

Now, what bugged me were the hidden fees such as the 10 percent shipping fee or with eBay's choice of payment, PayPal, taking 3.9 percent of whatever the buyer pays. 

To break it down for you, say I sell a product for $100 + $10 shipping. The buyer must pay $110 to me through PayPal in order for the transaction to go through and for me to ship the product out. Once paid, eBay will deduct $10 as a final value fee, $1 as a shipping fee, and PayPal will deduct $4.29 as a transaction fee. That leaves me with $94.71.

This can get confusing for some sellers, especially new sellers who may find it difficult to calculate the right price for their item without losing money on it.

Another problem mentioned was their ""protection"" or ""eBay Money Back Guarantee/Buyer Protection/Seller Protection""

I understand eBay wants to help the buyer and seller as much as they can, acting as the police force for anything that may go wrong in a transaction, but it can be taken too far sometimes. 

If a person were to sell a product to a buyer and it is not in the condition as described, the buyer may have the option to open a case against the seller to request money back from them due to false information. If the seller complies all is well. If the seller does not comply, big big uh-oh.

Say I sold a genuine Louis Vuitton purse, valued at $2500 over eBay. I explain in the listing it is a genuine product and provide proof of it being real as well as my policies. A person buys the purse, I get paid, I ship it to them, but the buyer isn't too sure of it being real when he/she receives it, so he/she wants to return it and opens a case against me. I have strict evidence proving the purse is in fact real and will not accept such a return for that reason provided. So in a moment like that, eBay will step in, deduct the money from me out of the blue and refund the buyer. A loss of a sale there, but I still get the purse back right? Wrong.

Ebay requires the buyer send the product to eBay for them to inspect and DESTROY. So not only do I lose the sale, but I lose the product too! All because a buyer may claim to be a Louis Vuitton purse professional and has suspicion it may be fake, even though everything checks out as real.

All this is from years of using eBay and having to learn the hard way how these inner fees and services actually work. If you are looking to buy an item for well below retail price or a crown jewel, eBay is your place to be. If you are looking to sell an item for profit, as a business strategy, or to just get rid of junk, eBay also serves as that haven, but do your research ahead of time and beware of fees and possible troubles you may run into with buyers.

To eBay directly, if you are reading this, please correct me in anything that may have possibly changed in your policies or operations. I am more than willing to listen and understand how these operations go and to ensure my experience goes smoothly the next time I sell as well as others experiences with your site as well.

Everything was ok untill my last purchase in March.   Went through ebay checkout to pay with paypal (have bank account and two cedit cards on file,verified  and in good standing) and my payment  was declined,tried several times but no luck.                 Called  paypal customer service  it did not offer specific help and hard to understand(believed it is outsourced ,India?)  Next I tried email  them, got response pretty fast compared to the time it took to explain the problem to them.  I was told they would fix it,tryed to use the checkout process again but was declined.  Emailed  again, same response or told to call giving me the same number i called before,just a big run around.  I went through that several times, before i gave up. Their response  was the same thing, it was automated web forms with a different name on it.          I had to remove my bank account and my credit cards  from paypal to keep them from getting ruined.   Made payment for my purchase by good ole American Mother Lovin cashiers check.  Now i have no confidence in their payment process or customer support, now will ask sellers if they will accept chashiers check or usps money order to pay  for a purchase, if not I won't bid.  I thought I might sell items myself , i would hate to be on sellers side that kind of problem.    To this day was not told what went wrong or if really really fixed.

The T-shirt material and color was very nice and of good quality, even the frock was very nice, but the size of the frock was of a newly born child. I immediately called ebay and told them. Few hours later, I got a call from the company from where this product was delivered, from somewhere in Mumbai. They took all the details and told me that they will pick up the frock from my house and will pay me back the money. And to my surprise, really the courier came and took it back, giving me a receipt, and just as they promised, after 15 working days, they returned my money also. This was my first experience with them. Now again, I got one new link of ebay, daily.ebay.in.   Its a food store and we can buy international brand food items from there.

Because I didn't have a bad transaction that couldn't be resolved by myself and the seller,  I believed that e-bay would stand behind the offers made by their sellers and if a seller made a mistake, it wouldn't cost me .  Then I ordered delicate beer glasses from Sharper Image during one of e-bays ""Black Friday"" deals and paid via credit card.  When the glasses arrived, the box ""jingled"" and I knew there was broken glass.  I enlisted the UPS delivery man to take the package back.  We opened the box and he asked me to agree that there was NO packing material in the box.  He said UPS was not at fault and I must go thru the seller for resolution.   With this information, I contacted Sharper Image who said I should throw out the broken glass and they would refund the full order price.  Time passed and no refund.  I opened an e-bay dispute and was royally screwed:  e-bay INSISTED I must return the broken glass to the Sharper Image even tho I had a note saying I should throw out the product.  Luckily my husband hadn't discarded the box and I was able to comply, but my enthusiasm for dealing with a site that doesn't use common sense .... I had the UPS statement outlining damage and cause .... I had the Sharper Image agreement ....  why should I pay return postage ($10 on a $25 purchase)?  But that is e-bay policy and that was that.   The day I mailed the box, I received an e-mail from Sharper Image saying they credited my credit card  (they belatedly honored their agreement with me). I didn't need to return the product at all.   To add to the bad customer support, e-bay sent a note telling me how well they had done in resolving my case:  100% refund!   Their response to my feedbacks that I only received a 60% refund - I paid 40% in postage was  a ""we got you 100% refund"".  Who needs an advocate who adheres strictly to the ""script"" despite a solid case for an exception and who can't calculate an accurate refund amount.  I consider myself lucky the shipping was only $10 ... it could have been much worse!   I now use e-bay ONLY if I can't find the product on Amazon or elsewhere on-line and use PayPal whenever possible.

Have seen many changes, and not all for the better. The latest insult (that I am aware of) was sellers not being able to leave anything but positive feedback for buyers, or anyone (not) being able to view someone's buying history to check for shill bidding - that's a sham. Sham, not shame, though THAT, too.
I am, or was, a major buyer with over 1000 positive feedback (no negs), and a seller with something over 50 (no negs)...but selling has become expensive, overfee'd and not worth the time. I still peruse the site for off-season and EUC to purchase, but as for selling what I could offer as a great deal...costs me more than I make when considering time put in to put up quality images, list in detail and ship.

1285,"As a buyer I love eBay and can get great deals - although not as easily as in years past.  As a seller I am constantly aware of the high cost of doing business on eBay, so it stands to reason that, as eBay continues to increase my cost of selling, my prices must go up and buyers, like me, can't get as good of a deal as in years past.  One simply leads to the other.  eBay does a good job of providing a safe buying environment, and their site continually improves with regard to features and ease of use.

On the selling side, eBay has some major issues.  eBay now makes profit on the amount charged for shipping  even though sellers like me charge actual shipping COST.  Unbelievable!! I've read many stories of good sellers being suddenly shut down without any explanation from eBay.  Many times these sellers made their entire income from eBay sales.  Ebay has been, and is currently being, sued for callous acts of this sort.  eBay makes it literally impossible for a seller to give anything but positive feedback to a buyer - even if the buyer is a liar, cheat and overall a--hole.  eBay cares 97% for customers and about 3% for sellers.  It's virtually impossible to get unfair negative feedback removed from a seller's record because of eBay's gigantic ""customer is always right"" bias. It's just a sad fact!  Problem is, unhappy sellers can make for more unhappy customers.

I urge eBay to consider the once all-powerful Howard Johnson restaurant chain.  The owner(s) sat back and counted their money - resting on their sizable laurels.  Meanwhile, a guy named Ray Kroc took a small hamburger stand and worked his butt off to build it into a behemoth restaurant chain - never resting and always re-investing his profits into more and more locations.  The chain is called McDonald's!  By the way, the Howard Johnson restaurant chain, once the country's largest,  no longer exists.  Not even one location survives!!!!  eBay should keep an eye out for all the other web sites vying for the top auction site spot.  eBay better not ignore and mistreat their sellers much longer.  There WILL be another Ray Kroc out there who'd love to welcome those sellers to his site!!

There simply isn't enough room on this page to explain ALL the bad things about selling on eBay.

1290,"I have been a Seller and a Buyer on eBay. In disgust, I gave up my membership. eBay has become a Buyers dream, as there continues to be many thousands of Sellers who allow eBay to charge them disproportionately high fees, then to disrespect them by never backing them up against unjustifiable complaints. To put is simply, all that a ""Buyer"" needs to do to vent their frustration is to enter a ""Negative"" against a Seller. To get the ""Negative"" removed the Seller must refund all of the ""Buyers"" costs, not expect to have the item returned, then the ""Seller"" must beg the ""Buyer"" to voluntarily remove the ""Negative"". This happened to me twice in about 750 ""Positives"". 
As always, I had done as I promised, but the first ""Buyer"" simply gave feedback stating ""This isn't what I had expected"" then gave a Negative ... not once did he write me as eBay says they should, and eBay totally backed the ignorant Buyer, not helping me whatsoever. ""The last time a Buyer gave me a Negative, he stated that a banknote which he won ""looked like a copy""; however it was crisp uncirculated and genuine. Again, no writing to me, which would have resulted in a refund, as it's much easier to refund than to try to argue with a fool. But eBay would not intercede, nor back me up. Instead it assured me that I could not give either ""Buyer"" a Negative, or to state that they had not even once attempted to contact me, as a Seller being able to tell the truth or to defend themselves is against eBay's policy!
 .......... I cancelled my eBay auctions and told them that once they apologized to me, changed the rules to protect their honest & decent Sellers, and refunded me my losses, that I would again sell on their website. Instead, they've continued to bill me for the auctions which I cancelled.  
eBay is run by folks who have figured how to maximize their profitability, and to do the least work to maintain. They have created so many rules to protect themselves, and to ignore their own Sellers. Their seemingly honest efforts of working with the Sellers, always result with referring the Seller to this or that rule and regulation, and requiring documentation upon documentation, then going their happy way knowing that for every defense that the Seller may offer, that there was a rule with which they would find impossible to comply! 
For example, for a Seller to send an item to the ""Buyer"" who is determined to rip them off, a Seller must send the goods with Insurance, and Signature Required ... only to have the ""Buyer"" state that the package was empty or had rocks, etc."" in it instead. There's no way to defend yourself against an unscrupulous ""Buyer"", and eBay won't even allow a Seller to enter Negative Feedback against any ""Buyer""! ((With this rule, eBay avoids a lot of ""Unnecessary Work""!))

Although it may seem counter-productive, because they are still the major on-line auction, many Sellers simply pray that they don't become prey to the bad Buyers.

Now I know I did not place a lot of those links in our listings, but still they push that on sellers to have to do that one by one. What a headache! They should pay us! 
Four times a years they offer free $$ of shipping supplies with ebay logo. They offer a lot of ways to try to generate sales like eBucks, Percentage off. They work hard to try to help the seller save some money but they also take so much and I sometimes feel we pay too much in fee's but when we do our taxes I see we do make an income.  There are scams on ebay but not as much as Amazon. There is a lot to say  as we have been on ebay a long time. I like eBay but sometimes we hate eBay and I am tired of feedbacks staying on an account for one year! Seems so excessive. Okay three months. And when you try so hard to be right and still get an idiot to leave you a neg. But then I place them in a bad buyers list so everyone can know he or she was an idiot.",4,“eBay is better than Amazon as far as Scams”

1306,"I love the variety of products available on eBay. I find myself on the site quiet often just looking at items. Comparing prices , reading item descriptions. I've found that if you check back often you may find some really great deals. You have the option to buy the items now or some you have the option to bid on. Which is one of my favorite features of this site. I won a pair of new plus size jeans for $5.89 plus $10.00 shipping & a new pair of black & white striped Old Navy flip flops for just $4.00 (shipping included). Since sellers are able to set their own prices , you will find some truly ridiculous prices throughout the site. Don't let that throw you , they are plenty of great deals & truly fair price listings there as well.",4,“My Favorite Shopping Place At This Time!” 
1307,"I've been using eBay for several years and have spent several thousand dollars in purchases. All of a sudden they blocked my account so I can't even get on it. I called them and talk to customer service and wish they told me they suspended my account over a $32 bill that is 10 years old and I have never been notified of this nor believe that it's even my bill. They couldn't tell me over the phone what it was for. The lady said it's probably just insertion fees for pictures when I sold things through them. I cannot believe this because they always Bill my PayPal account and took the money out right away as soon as I placed any ads. I haven't sold anything in a long time through eBay and they still won't unblock my account unless I pay them for a bill that I'm not even sure that I owe.

It's kind of funny how they took so long to bring up this bill and still no notification has ever been given for this matter. They'd rather lose me as a customer than admit that they might have made an error and just dismiss the bill that is like I said 10 years old.

It is easy to charge a persons credit card, but hard to get people nowadays to admit they got a problem, I have decided for a few reasons that it is not a good season to sell or buy on ebay.  Buyers & Sellers catch a bad rap.  If you are not a big name, you probably don't get your item out there before you have to relist, more fee's.  Auction style listings is just a license now to steal expensive products.  People bid on your items and then don't pay, or claim they thought it was new.  I just came back to ebay, and I will be leaving just as quick.  I will pay my bill and delete my listings and close my account.  This is not the season to support any business, that is shaky about supporting you. I will take a loss on the phone purchase and list it on another marketplace with truthful facts and the bigger loser will be the seller, who's reputation won't hold water as news travel that  his or her products are indeed questionable. I am a vendor, who moves products, and work with people who also sold on ebay for years, but outrageous fees or too many problems pushed them right out the door.  Ebay is a large marketplace, so you can expect problems down the road. I just assume keep it small, and have a say in my product.",4,“I am A Seller & Buyer” 
1320,I have purchased a number of fake gemstones like dyed green quartz sold as emerald and amethyst that is purple glass. ebay is pretty good if you complain in a timely manner but they need to do a better job of getting rid of false labeled gemstones. I finally got a gem tester and as suspected I had a number of fake Gemstones made of glass or mislabeled sapphire that is actually aquamarine or topaz. I still uses ebay but rely on mostly trusted sellers and reading reviews of past buyers helps to ensure your getting what  you pay for.

1361,"We Know that Ebay is not Quite fair towards Sellers Anymore.   I been participating / watching ebay for over a decade and a half. At first just watched the phenomena of being able to sell anything from home. so i tried my luck at it with some Katchina dolls i scored when this spoiled rich lady was moving towns. My luck scored my Ebay starter Kit .  Then as I Progressed i realized it's not easy and it's quite competitive. of course i was not aware of drop shipping and all the various routines people can run on ebay to make $, but keep their hands clean of work.  SO Unaware of those option (not like i'd pursue them) i set out to sell anything i found in estate & yard sales Etc.  of Course as everything evolves so was the marketplace and Ebay's constantly changing policies.  That's one of my biggest pet peeves against ebay how they constantly keep ""improving"" the platform... and now it has evolved to the point where sellers cannot leave a negative feedback for any buyer rather they can report a buyer, the vice versa is not so true.   If one being a seller gets a negative feedback depending on the buyers ""mood"" having nothing to do with service or quality of the item.  but then again that's 1 out of several hundred transactions.  IF you do Decide to Become A seller This is What i'd Advise : start casually.  ebay gives you 50 free auctions a month. thats quite plenty.  make yourself a neat template in Open Office of Word .   learn to do live listings so you are comfortable with the platform.  no matter how much i hurry to do a good listing takes at least 20 minutes  ** researching the item  *** taking optimal photos showcasing strengths and weaknesses *** measure weight and dimension ** write a few specific words about the item ***   thats all is necessary to do a great listing. make sure you opt into global shipping.   For Domestic Shipping since Ebay is very competitive I list With free shipping meaning price included.  so consider all that when researching price.  In the listing it shows i Provide free Priority shipping, but when it comes to actual shipping if it goes to a major urban center and it is under 13oz it will go out as first class to save a bit of $... if it's rural or it's over 13 oz then it has to go in a bubble padded priority envelope (x2.3,4)  i have shipped christmas brandy glasses wrapped 4 times in bubble wrap and they made it 2000k intact!!!  so yes.  the most important part of the sale.  make sure you pack secure!! extra extras secure and keep the weights within range to keep shipping cost low.  super important in e commerce.  also if you can pass that on to your customer you have the edge over people that charge  an extra 5-8$ in shipping for same item.   So. as much as we do not like Ebay.  they are still very relevant.   i ship items across the world with the global shipping program so the headache of international shipping is not on me.  Ebay is still top dog for items and traffic of all auction sites even though 2/3 op the inventory is fixed priced items.. hope this is helpful to someone out there.",4,“Unnecessarily Evil - A Seller's Perspective”

1369,"I have been using eBay for a number of years and only buy items. I'm located in Bermuda and is quite limited to goods, so an online marketplace is my best friend. 
I buy from a wide range of sellers from different global locations.Generally, American orders arrive here faster but are usually more expensive goods. Likewise, Chinese goods are cheaper but sometimes a lower quality. Most of my disputes relate to packages not arriving and few arrive months after, which forces me to send a separate paypal transaction to return the refund. This being said, if I was a seller- I have to recognize that there's down-market competition, shipping time is vital for western sellers and not every person will return the items or repay if receive them late. 
I find eBay to be fair in their judgments. If you don't provide tracking or verified document from a courier stating the item was delivered- how can eBay decide in favor for the seller. 
I find most of the ""Scam"" of eBay is in their auctions. People make false accounts to raise bids. Some bitter people bid just to avoid a low sale of an item they just bought for more and never buys the item, so the auction is redone. I hate reserve pricing; a buy now price of $1000, a reserve of $900 and the bid starts at $0.99. 
eBay has room to improve in other ways too. I'm tired of going in a specific section like ""Game consoles"" and finding hundreds of listings for case and skins for game devices- these are and should be in ""Game Accessories"".
Overall, the only issue I have with eBay at the moment is the Global Shipping Program. It maybe worth it to sellers but that program charges additional fees and duties that International countries (like mine) do not accept. Thus, as a buyer- I generally avoid global shipping sellers.",4,“Great site for an International Buyer”

On many occasions I have had sellers make stupid choices (Putting an iPad in a flimsy bubble wrap pouch...)

1374,"All in all EBay is a great website for buying or selling average to new quality items..

I wouldn't suggest selling tat or rubbish, as EBay always side with the buyer - under the money back guarantee. 

That would be the only thing EBay should change the bias attitude as they always take the side of the buyer no matter how odd the case is! 

I've sold over 65 things on EBay and not really had any problems other than some buyers having unrealistic expectations when buying one of my used products. 

I'd definitely give EBay a chance, but be prepared for a few set backs if your a seller.

If your interested in joining EBay as a buyer then its 5* as you either get the item or you get your money back, if your not happy with the description you get your money back or if your 100% happy with everything you usually get a really good value bargain.

Sometimes a seller may have a loooot of good ratings so that the bad ones disappear in the crowd. Look them up, read why they were unhappy with the purchase and then consider if you still can trust the seller. Maybe it was just a problem with longer waiting time for a customer or it could be something more serious that you are scared of happening to you.

Also, I am on the internet to find lower prices, not higher than in stores. Then of course, if it is ridiculously cheap then always consider why that can be the case. 

Lastly, if it is something that has a high risk of being fake (collector's objects or alike), then it is good to try and contact the seller for more pictures. If you get no answer maybe he is unavailable or just ignores it all together for reasons we fear. If he agrees it is good if you ask the seller to put something in the picture that normally would not be included so you know that the picture is genuine. Maybe a bottle or a cup, an item everyone has but would not normally be included in photos on the internet so that he can just copy it and send it to you.

1396,"There are some keys to using EBay:

1. If you bid, make sure your payment is made according to seller's terms (e.g., some quire PayPal).

2. Don't be seducd by low price excluding Shipping, unless it says Free Shipping, which is the current craze that's continuing to blow up online shopping. Also, if Shipping details are omitted, move on (only buy from up-front sellers).

3. Most unsuccessful buys can be traced to poor communication. If the listing (esp. the Full Description page) is vague, maybe they don't really have the item(s).

I've made roughly 100 purchases and never got shafted. I read carefully and don't buy when it seems overhyped or overpriced for what it is (except once I overpaid on a whim, my bad).

All in all I'm happy wth EBay. I still hate how hard it is to recover a password, which happens about yearly for me (and that I can't keep one good secure password forever, or re-use my old ones). Sellers have been pretty accommodating. I've only had two or three returns.

The worst part is when there is a dispute (which I had to initiate twice). Those always took months to resolve, no matter what. eBay is very hush-hush about those! Odd.

I also dislike how slowly/never my failed transactions (okay there were just a couple of them, but they were distracting) finally disappeared from my lists. I had to request a couple of cancels for good reasons. Sellers agreed right away, but EBay was like, ""Oh, big no-no!"" That part feels like they are greedy and have no good-customer loyalty.

4. There is a well-worked-over process in place for returns, and it must be followed to the letter, so buyer beware if the seller looks inexperienced, there could be a bad outcome. Like buying anywhere, use your brain and you'll be fine.",4,"“The original, still the best I've found” "

It was fast to list the books using this mitad app on my iphone, and the selling fees are less than ebay would have charged for the same books.  But it took a long while to finally unload all of the books.",4,“It was ok for getting rid of my kids textbooks”

1402,"I been with Ebay for 3 years now as a buyer. My advice as a buyer, and as a seller too, would be to do your homework on the person you want to bid or buy from, sell to.. By what I mean by homework is, look at percentage number next to there name, this tells you out of 100 percent what they measure up to. Look at what other customers say about them.

i am writing this just in case this company Kooboe uk think that the situation regarding the Roveway R8 I bought from and am returning to them due to a fault is of such concern to them that it demands a product recall should be brought to your attention. The only way I have found to contact them is through Ebay.
if it turns out that the problem is only with the unit I purchased and they issue me with a replacement or repaired unit i will inform you.
The details i have for the company are as below although i believe this is only a mailing address.

I will return the product Roveway R8 with your return label asap. I hope your concern is for this particular unit is confined to it. If your concern is for the whole of the units you would have a major problem on your hands with product recall and loss of sales. Due to this concern of yours i have reported this matter to Trading Standards who should be informed if your concern is for the whole units. I hope that the problem is confined to this particular unit then we will all be happy, you wont have to recall units and i will have mine returned.

Ms Tiwi Wang COMPANY SECRETARYand Mr Se Cai COMPANY DIRECTOR
I have been having correspondence with your ebay site but have not had any definite answers.
The problem is i purchased on the 20th February a ROVERWAY R8 balance scooter.
We charged it up as per the instructions and it was perfect for 20 mins after which it packed up and went no more
The problem is i have asked for a replacement which under the terms of your warranty i am due to.
i have only been offered a refund. i realise that the price i paid of £64.00 was low but that was the result of an auction in which i was lucky and does not affect my statutory rights.
Please resolve this situation all i ask is SEND ME A NEW ONE COLLECT THIS ONE and do your company proud.
APROMP REPLY WOULD BE APPRECIATED

1425,"I love Ebay. The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because you have to know what to watch out for - you can run into a bad apple once in awhile but Ebay has a pretty solid system if you know how to use it to protect yourself. Here are a few valuable tips. 

As a buyer - check seller 'feedback', (top right hand corner next to the seller name, number next the stars). This is how many people have purchased items from them. You are usually safe if they have lots of feedback. But read the negative reviews if you are buying jewelry, expensive items. Only a few people are diligent enough to discover 'fakes' or ""knock-offs'. Also check their seller history and past seller ID's. Sometimes it takes awhile for sellers to get caught selling fakes, etc. so they just change their seller name and start a whole NEW account until they get discovered again then start new again until caught again. But Ebay is usually pretty good about keeping history so unless they change banking info, etc. you will find them under 'seller history'. 

You can usually get better deals if you buy from an individual rather than a full time seller so if little feedback, just make sure to stay on top of 'buyer protection' deadlines and policies so if you get burned, you can get your money back from Ebay.

Just because it's a local seller, don't be fooled. Sometimes they buy the fakes from the Chinese or international sellers and resell them under the guise of being local. Check the sellers buying history or feedback as a buyer. You can usually see where they buy from if you investigate their feedback carefully. 

Read each sellers policy. Some won't pay for return shipping if they sell you a bad item so then make sure to open up a case with Ebay through the resolution center rather than just working with the seller because if it's fake or 'not as described', Ebay will make them pay for the shipping. I usually open a case if I'm returning to make sure they don't say ""I never got it"" if I send it back. With an open case, Ebay monitors the tracking number so they can't do that and monitor it and have control over the sellers banking and Ebay returns your money, not the seller.

If bidding, make sure to put your real top dollar price in at the end if the item is super low priced. Sometimes sellers have someone bid on it at the last minute if it is too low or a buyer is waiting on the sidelines to outbid you and you could miss out if you really want it.  

Shipping is usually faster than promised. Always add insurance on valuables because sellers can say they sent it, send an empty box, etc. and you can open a case but it can be 'your word against theirs' if the seller has a tracking number. Established sellers won't usually do this but you never know if it's really valuable because one bad feedback won't hurt their score much.

As a seller, ebay only gets two stars.  I have very limited experience selling on line but my experience selling on ebay is only 50% good.  And most of what I sell on ebay are itms I purchased on ebay. 
The first time, ebay removed a product from the listing after only one bid and the product reappeared one hour before bidding was over.  Customer service could not find the listing and said that I must have removed it myself. Thankfully, the buyer understood.  
A second time, ebay restricted my account so I could not access my account at all.  When I reached customer service (2 days), I was told that there was no reason for it so they re-instituted it.
A third time, ebay removed one listing saying I violated MC999 policy after there were already bids on the item.  However, I did not violate the policy.  I was told that I would be provided information on how to provide proof by a lady named Gel but never got the info.  I called 4 days later and finally received the info.  It is terrible that a specialist can act first without giving the seller a chance to show that their suspicion was incorrect. What was worse was that there were at least 30 other similar items being sold on ebay and some of them were counterfeit.
Fourthly, if you are not a top rated seller, your listing appears at the very bottom of a long list.  Sometimes, you cannot even find your listing at all.  I have searched my listing using the lowest or highest price function.  In both searches, my item appeared at the bottom of the list even though it was not the highest or the lowest priced.  For some of what I offer, my items never appear on any searches.  Therefore, I think ebay searches are somehow set up to favor their Top rate plus sellers, the ones who garner ebay the most money.
Lastly, a buyer filed a not as described complaint. I wss willing to give a full refund AFTER the buyer returned the product.  Ebay provided a continue button for me to proceed with my response stating that the continue button signifies that I was willing to give a refund.  However, ebay did not indicate that clicking the button meant instantaneous refund.  So now I am out the money and restitution is dependent on the honesty of the buyer.
All of the above happened in my 4 month experience as a seller, I wrote the CEO, John Donahoe,  who never responded.  I guess the buck does not stop with ebay's CEO. 
 When I had problems with several online purchases at Home Depot and wrote the CEO, I got an email back within 12 hours. A specialist was assigned to help me and all my issues were resolved in one week. Home Depot's CEO does take full responsibility for that reason Home Depot will always get my business first as long as the value us there.",4,“I give ebay a 4 stars because I am primarily a buyer...”

Most of their bags, even when heavily discounted, run about $90 and up, unless you get a swingpack purse (little tiny purse). I have purchased probably 10 handbags on there, both for myself and gifts, and only had to return two, as one was too big and one was too small. No problem with the returns, either.

Only buy from someone with 100% positive feedback. The best ones have between 50-1000 reviews, because they will bend over backwards to protect their rep. You may think your safe buying from someone with 99.8 positive feedback with 50,000 reviews, but your negative is just a drop in the bucket to them.

The sellers list their items as authentic and promise the buyer that they're honest sellers and would never buy or sell a replica item. I've even had a seller tell me that a Chanel bag I purchased was confirmed authentic by MyPoupette.com (an online company that authenticates Chanel bags for a fee). You've guessed it, the bag is a fake. Don't be fooled by Chanel bags being advertised as vintage or rare bags because they too are most likely fakes. My suggestion to all designer bag fashionistas, if you truly desire an authentic designer handbag, only purchase one at an authorized dealer or a Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Hermes, etc. Boutique. Also, remember the golden shopper's rule, read the seller's feedback section, it is there to both inform and protect you the consumer. On the bright side, E-Bay has just about everything under the sun, so if you're looking for a hard to find item, E-Bay probably has it and several of them at a range of prices.

1.  eBay is the land of fees.  If they can find a way to charge you a fee for it, they will.  I'm kind of surprised they don't charge a ""log-in"" fee for every time you sign in.  Maybe they just haven't thought of it yet.
2.  If you're selling, don't sell things overseas!  The only items I've ever had that have supposedly gotten lost have been items shipped overseas - and I question whether or not they were really lost - and those have all been $50+ items.  Hmmmm
3.  As a rule, if someone has a low feedback rating (less than 100), it's probably best to steer clear of them for bigger ticket items, but give them a chance - everybody started out with a 0 rating at one time or another.  Just order a small items initially and see how they perform.  The seller will appreciate it and you might find someone you want to deal with again in the future.

Once I bought a computer, which the seller completely lied about the os that was installed, ram, etc. (Finally resolved but I lost $60 in the deal).
Once I ordered a software upgrade and the seller claimed ""We're out of what you ordered so we sent you this instead"" (Meanwhile they sold 8 more of what they were ""out of"", while I was getting my dispute resolved)

I now will order from ebay but I set myself a limit, $25. The amount one could easily blow going out to eat or to the movies. That way, if the deal goes south; I just ""watched a lousy movie"".

I recommend ebay.com because you CAN find some unusual and interesting items there, that you may not be able to find elsewhere.

1540,"Lets face it, eBay is the world's flee-market!  They don't like to think of themselves this way but it is true.  Think about it...  You can find almost anything you are looking for and most of the time a lot less.

  About 6 months ago, we needed a part for our home heating system.  The part was about $199.00 locally.  We found it on the web for $119.00 and was about to purchase it (thinking we were saving $80 bucks!) when I decided to check eBay.  eBay had one for $36.00 and another for $17.95!!  A savings of $182.00 over what I found locally.  Also found a new A/C compress for my truck for $80.00 when Autozone wanted $249.00.

   How can anyone not like eBay?  I have never been let down as a buyer of ebay items however, as a seller, we have had our share of ""problem customers"" because they do not read the complete description in the ad. 

   The only problem I have with eBay itself, is once you get use to it and how it works they change something!  They use to show the bidder's user name.  I could watch that name to see if it was a fake ad or a shill bidder.  You can't do that anymore since they no longer display the bidder's user name (they do show it to you if your are the seller of the item).

   Anyway,  just remember to read the complete item description and if you see a $1000.00 item getting ready to sell for $25.00, be afraid, very afraid... It's a scam item and they want you to send them money using Western Union (which eBay advises against...) or to PayPal them to a different email address.  Hackers do this because they have hijacked someone sellers account and need you to send the money to a different PayPal account - not the hijacked account's Paypal account.

If someone pays $3 for regular shipping, they give a 1 or 2 star rating on cost of shipping or if shipping takes one week (delays in Canada Postal services), then you get bad ratings, even though you have NO CONTROL over these issues. EBay should really change their policies because if (happened to me) someone buys two items from you and then thinks $4 is too much to pay for shipping from Canada to the US and it takes 10 days regular mail, giving you 1 and 2 star DSR, your account is restricted (when you get 2 one and two star ratings for one of the four DSR categories and you'll be unable to sell further items until the month passes and the bad ratings are ""knocked off"".

1567,"I'm a sporadic user of Ebay but my wife has been buying from it for at least ten years (somebody stop her, please? LOL) and has had no bad deals that I know of in all that time.

I got into it I think about 8 years ago and it's changed a lot since then. It's opened the doors to professional dealers of varying trustworthiness, it's acquired PayPal and Skype, it's changed it's rating scheme to make buyers look better and sellers look worse, it's invented Ebay stores and Buy It Now, both fixed price transactions, and it's continuously messed around with the design of members' home pages in an ongoing attempt to make them as unhelpful as possible. The site itself has got gradually more slow-loading over the years too, as more and more Flash and interactivity has been deployed. Currently the front page is trying to be ""Web 2.0"" by having a word cloud, which slows the page down a bit and really isn't serving any useful purpose at all. 

I've mainly been a buyer rather than a seller. I've sold maybe a dozen things and bought maybe a hundred. All my transactions went fine and I had no PayPal problems. I understand this is not everyone's experience. I've always paid promptly and have a 100% rating as a buyer (though this is easier to get now than before). I do enjoy the excitement of the chase in those last few seconds, and if I can manually ""snipe"" a bid in at the very last moment and win a great deal, it's a great experience. Sadly, people now deploy sniping programs, ""bots"" that bid for them in that vital last moment and can monitor and bid in multiple auctions simultaneously. Not cheating, but not fair either.

Whatever you're looking for, Ebay is like a landfill, everything ends up there sooner or later. If you think of it just like a physical auction, and remember the golden rules of physical auctions  - Only bring as much money as you can afford to waste, and keep your hands in your pockets unless you really mean to bid - then you should generally be OK. Never, ever assume that anything cheaply sold is anything other than cheaply made. If it's priced like a fake, it's a fake. If you don't know how to tell, walk away.

Personally I wouldn't buy anything very large or very valuable this way unless it was specialized enough to be of little interest to your average second-hand junk dealer and the seller was knowledgeable enough to answer questions accurately. Though of course people routinely do, up to and including used fire engines and the occasional submarine. I just don't play in that league.

You're well advised to take with the proverbial pinch of salt anyone who says ""I don't know anything about these"". That's potentially a dealer who bought the item at either a local auction, estate sale or even thrift store precisely because she knew *everything* about these. People commonly use such expressions to distance themselves from an item, and sometimes in the hope that you'll bite only because you think you've found a bargain that the seller doesn't know about.

Volumes - literally - have been written about trading on Ebay and the temptation is to write another one, because the subject is so complex. Commonsense will take care of many of your concerns, though, and the strength to walk away from a deal you're not too sure of. 

What's missing here is the sellers' points of view. Hopefully we can get some regular sellers to tell us about their experiences with Ebay as well, because buying is only half the story.",4,“I'm a sporadic user of Ebay but my wife has been buying...”

I've ordered 500+ items over the last couple of years and have been very pleased.
Of all those total sales, only one transaction was an issue that required EBay's involvement. After investigation, EBay promptly refunded my purchase price because the Seller had 'disappeared' and wouldn't respond. This all happened within 5 days. I use PayPal so the money was returned to my account there.
One other time, a small item wasn't delivered. I contacted the Seller by email (China) and they promptly re-sent another. It arrived on schedule...problem solved.
Presently, I have another 5 'active' orders with 5 different Sellers and have complete confidence that everything will arrive as promised.

If I sell something on e-bay BE SURE TO TAKE DETAILED PICTURES OF IT IN EVERY WAY so in CASE you get something back that has been switched out, you can prove with your pictures that what you sent out was NOT what was returned. ALL-WAYS protect yourselves with pictures and proof because the scams out there are rampant and you don't want a bad experience as e-bay goes with who has more legitimate proof to prove the truth. Don't be lazy in buying or selling. Take lots of pictures, model numbers, all around, make notes and always have a USPS Tracking number to prove your integrity. Then you will be okay. E-bay cares. You just can't be careless if you want to be listened to and believed by e-bay. They deal with a lot of claims and scams. Make it easy for them and you WILL win, and always tell the truth.",5,“Love.

1640,"I started visiting eBay when I wanted to replace my rented cable modem. By owning my own I would save $10.00/mo on my cable bill. I was going to buy the Arris gateway but it would have taken 2 years to break even. I noticed the exact cable modem I was renting was available for sale, but with one exception. They were all used. The one exception was a ""Lot of 7"" modems for around $500.00, so I decided to buy the seven, sell the six I didn't need on eBay and end up with my own for free.
The plan was going so well I decided to buy another lot of seven, and then another. It was easy to get started selling and as the extra modems sold on eBay, I was actually doing quite well financially. However, suddenly the modems I had sold started coming back to me. Evidently the ISP didn't like having their branded devices owned by their customers instead of being rented to them.
In the end I ended up refunding two-thirds of the sold modems, which was made easy with eBay and PayPal, and getting refunded myself for two of the three lots I had purchased, even though the seller was no longer an eBay member. eBay's return policy protected not only my buyers but me as well. Plus, I ended up with the Arris modem I had wanted in the first place from the profits on my non-returned devices.

I've bought over 100 items on eBay, and for the most part, I'm very glad I did because I'm sure I've saved 100's of dollars by doing so. Their selection is huge, and once you understand how everything works in their system, it should be an enjoyable shopping experience for you. I usually just pay the ""buy it now"" price for my item(s), but I've also won several auctions as the highest bidder on unique items, and also paid less by 'making an offer' to the seller when it's an option for the item (and the seller accepts my offer). I can't comment on selling anything on eBay, because I never have. Finally, I'm mostly satisfied with eBay's customer service/resolution department for any issues I've had. My only real complaint is that there are some seller's I've bought from on eBay that ended up being fictitious accounts (I never received the item I purchased). But because of eBay's guarantee, I was issued a full refund for my purchase price and shipping once the resolution department researched the issue and decided in my favor.",5,“A great way to shop!”

Just recently however, we bought a classic Nintendo video game. This seller said it was a five screw, when it arrived it was a three screw. Anyone who buys older videos games knows this is a huge issue. Due to my forgetfulness I missed the return by date and thought I was stuck with the game. EBay however decided to refund my money and did not require me to return the game! Simply wow!",5,“excellent experience” 
1754,"Yeah, everybody knows about it, and many of us look there first for most everything on-line.  I am no different.  Great for craft items and bargain costume jewelry.  I've had great prices on musical instruments, clothing from India and a lot more.  The trick is to become an ebay-oholic and do heavy research, checking new sellers and used items for deals.  But that can be dangerous if, like me, you can get carried away. 

Unless something is  truly unusual, don't buy from the first seller that offers it, especially from China.  Also be aware of shipping fees which are not always obvious, especially if you have been looking at ""free shipping"" things for a while.  Finally, some real deals can be had under ""ending soonest.""  You might catch something others have missed.  Again, when under a deadline, be sure to check shipping costs!  

Feedback can be helpful, but eBay hassles sellers for good marks, who in turn hassle us, the buyers, albeit usually nicely.",5,“I go there first.”

I have been shopping off of ebay a very long time now and i have probably bought over 50 items off of it. Out of those items i have not recieved about 2.

1782,Awesome,5,“Awesome” 
1783,"I have yet to have a bad experience with Ebas customer service in regards to sellers. I have been duped when it came to sellers overseas that had a picture of item and when I received it looked nothing like the picture. Or when a seller lied and said they lived in California but they really lived in China and it took my order forever to show up, customer service has always made sure I got my money back. The second key is emailing the seller to show how you are communicating with them in attempts to get your money back. The extra documentation helps tremendously. I say this because once I tried communicating with a seller about refunding my money for shoes she sent with the stuffing coming out and she begged me to keep  them and accept her discount. I said no and proceeded to return the shoes to China. She was upset and stop responding to my emails But I had taken pictures of the receipt and the money I paid to ship it back. I was charged for the shoes and shipping which came to 60.00. Thank God for Paypal. When Ebay couldn't get her to respond to them either they refunded all of my money which is why I will continue to use them when compared to Rosegal which is a complete ripoff.Some sellers use beautiful pictures of celebrities to sell items but only a few of them look like the actual item when you receive it. I will continue to use Ebay.",5,“Excellent Customer Service”

1792,It's the first place I go when I am looking for something.i feel like I get a pretty good deal most of the time. If something isn't right you have the eBay guarantee  to make it right or your money back. Can't ask for more than that.

1800,the best!!!!!!!!!!!!,5,“the best” 
1801,"Great site, can get just about everything here.",5,“Great site” 
1802,"Love ebay, as a buyer...haven't tried selling, yet.  The auctions are fun, if the wait is a bit frustrating at times.  I've only had one bad seller there, all others have been great, especially when it comes to answering questions.

As in all online sites you have to check on the seller reliability, that's what burned me when I first started buying...make to sure to check customer comments for each seller I buy from...Though this can be unreliable when it comes to the Chinese sellers.  Personally, I don't buy from anyone with a rating below 99.0% rating and have only been burned once.

Paying with Paypal has been great as I don't have to give any credit card info to each individual seller when making purchases.  Hopefully I will still have this option when ebay and Paypal split.  I've gone on to use Paypal when shopping other sites, keeping all of my credit card info private and in one place rather than spread out across the internet.  You don't have to have a Paypal card to use Paypal...

As far as Customer Service goes, The only problems I've had was in language and I requested, nicely, to have another representative with better English and everything was settled.  I have always been treated with respect and my problems resolved within one phone call (1-866-540-3229, 5AM - 10PM PT, M-Sun).

UPDATE:  Just last month, Jan 2016, I was burned on a purchase from China.  The seller expected to get favorable rating for item when 2 cords were missing.  This is NOT ebay's fault but the seller.  I got burned because I compromised on the 99% feedback rule I usually follow...this seller had 99.4%. 

After reading some of the complaints I realized that many, not all, are blaming ebay alone for the sellers' ripping people off.   If buyers do their homework...check feedback and do Searches online for customer reviews of brands, there's less chance of being taken.  Don't want to say ebay is perfect and always gets buyer's money returned, but it's ultimately up to the buyer for refunds.  Too many complaints against a seller then ebay suspends them...  Not sure how that works since not seller.  Do remember that after the 30 days nothing will be done...you have contact the seller yourself....Been there, Done that and it doesn't work, at least for me.",5,“Never had a Problem...” 
1803,So much available - great prices that are negotiable.  Love it.,5,“Who doesn't shop eBay?”

1805,Ive bought a lot of different items off of ebay and so far no issues. Usually one of the cheapest places to find things as well. If you order something out of country the shipping time is a little longer but its worth it for the price you pay! highly recommended!,5,“Great experience!” 
1806,I'VE BEEN ORDERING AND SELLING A FEW ITEMS ON EBAY NOW FOR A LONG TIME AND I HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM THEY HAVENT RESOLVED. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!,5,“AWESOME” 
1807,"I have been on eBay for over 9 years. Many of their selling policies have changed and they have to much to say about what one can sell.  The fees are to high, so it makes it hard to give people a really good affordable price.
A basic stores (9%) fees..that is insane + a shipping %..really now! Is it that serious...other selling platforms do not charge additional  for shipping; so why should eBay.?....Oh! don't forget you still have to pay Paypal fees. (which I must say are very reasonable).I A seller has to really jack up their prices to make a decent net....So, personally I stay away from the auction because of this.  eBay may have been the best selling platform in the beginning, but not so now. Controlling your business, what you say and how you advertise and communicate with your buyers. eBay.. Com'on really!... can't prevent communication. If my customer wants something that i am not listing... I am surely not going to post it just to make the sell. eBay wake up and get on board with other successful sites that have much better seller fees and exposure.

If you are a buyer, eBay.com is a wonderful, cheap site to do your shopping and is very reliable. It is filled with many distributors that sell their products much cheaper than what you would pay in a store. At least, depending who you're buying from. It's one of the few sites I'll purchase from online. And here's why:
I've purchased from eBay for years and all from different people and every time has been successful. The key to having a successful purchase is to read the ratings people have given the seller. This is shown beside the item's picture under the seller's name. If the seller is rated above 90% by many people (not just 1 or 2), you can assume it's safe to order from them. 
I suggest you scroll down where there's a page full of detailed information about the product (usually in bold, colourful font). There you will see information regarding the size of the item, the materials it's made of, the average time it takes for the product to arrive in different countries, and how to contact them if there's an issue. A good seller will always encourage you to contact them if there's a problem and they will gladly fix it for you. But, you'll probably never need to contact them.
The item usually ships between 1-2 days business days after you pay for it. The seller will specify. It will take longer if you order an item that needs to be specially made. It took a little over a week for the seller to ship a costume she had designed for me. That's understandable. The item will usually arrive between the time frame the seller says. Note the ""usually"". It may take a few days more or a few days less. It is just an estimate. But it's usually pretty accurate. It has been for me anyways.
I hope this has been helpful for you. You can trust eBay if you buy from them.",5,“**PLEASE READ**”

1943,"I love shopping on Ebay.com!  You can find so many unique things that you can't find anywhere else.  Some that you need and some that you didn't know you needed until you discovered them!  I've purchased 350+ items on Ebay.com and have only had two negative experiences.  

Some tips for those new to purchasing on Ebay.  You can bid on items or use the ""Buy it Now"" feature to purchase an item for the specified price.  While it is exciting to bid on items, be careful that you don't get too caught in the excitement of winning that you end up spending more than you wanted to or get hooked on bidding on lots of different items.  I did for awhile and found myself in debt so I learned my lesson.  Just know your limits.  

Always do your homework on the seller that you're thinking or purchasing an item from.  Check their percentage score.  The closer to 100% feedback the better.  I won't touch anything under 90% and am even leary of those under 99% but that's just me.  You also should look to see how many items the seller has sold as that does factor into how good or bad their score seems.  If they haven't sold very many items and have a very low score that's a huge red flag while others that have sold thousands might not be as bad but still worth doing your homework.  I always go to the seller profile an while it scrolls their most recent feedback, click on where it says to ""View all feedback"".  You can then see how many good, neutral and bad reviews they've had for the last month, 6 months and 12 months.  I often will scroll through many pages of feedback to find the neutral and mainly negative reviews to see why they received this feedback and then determine if I want to do business with them.  Also if you find a seller that has sold very few items, look at the ebay id's that left feedback for them.  If you see that there are many of the same ebay id leaving feedback, that could be friends of theirs building up their score to give you confidence in buying from them in hopes that you won't look at the id's.  Early on when I started using Ebay I got bit by this very thing.  They were a fraudulent seller and I never received my item and they closed their account!

Overall Ebay is a great experience that I highly recommend, just do your homework to get the best experience.  Happy shopping!   :)",5,“I love shopping on Ebay.com!” 
1944,"I have had only good experiences using e-bay. Of course you have to be careful what you buy and read the sellers reviews and profile before you buy something.

1945,"I have used this site for years, and have had few problems. Purchases are easily completed and arrive quickly, and many of the sellers are very accomodating if you have problems with the purchases. I have also sold successfully on this site and had good customers. 

In ten years, I've only used the dispute process three times, but found it to be very easy and obtained a refund with no problems though paypal. I love this site and will continue to use it for many years to come for all my online purchases.

I have also successfully sold several used items on ebay and never had any problems from my buyers, although browsing the forums will turn up some horror stories about dishonest buyers. There is scamming on both sides of the deal, but most people who use ebay are honest and just looking for a fair deal for their money, which I try to provide. I'm not too into their new rules about waiting for your money until you can prove an item is delivered or 21 days, but using DC will help fix that problem.

The bottom of the pot said 1801 made in Korea with the stamp of Paul Revers head on it. The bottom of the pot was made of chrome and copper clad bottom. This tea pot was so cute. The seller was so kind and sent all details about the pot. When it arrived it was almost in mint condition. There was just a small scratch on the top by the spout. The little tea pot is really cool. Things like this are only found on ebay. I lucked out getting such a nice item. They still have a few left but some are not in quite the same condition of the pot I won.

1992,"I've bought and sold on eBay for more than ten years. If you want to sell something online, it doesn't get any better than eBay. I like to think of it as an online garage sale. The advantage of selling on eBay over having a garage sale is exposure. Instead of having random people from a limited local area looking at what you are trying to sell, you get a nationwide, or worldwide, audience. And your auction listing will also get a targeted audience. For the most part, the people looking at the item you list are people who are interested in exactly what you are trying to sell. They had to search for your auction to find it. With a targeted nationwide audience, that item that you would be lucky to sell for $10 at a garge sale might now find buyers willing to pay many times more. You can make a greater profit when selling on eBay compared to selling through other common venues.

As a buyer, sometimes eBay is the only place you would be able to find stuff. If you're looking for used, vintage, antique, collectable, rare, unique, one-of-a-kind items, eBay is still the best place on the internet to find them. Over the years, eBay has evolved into a marketing tool for sellers offering brand new products, and sometimes you can find good deals on those items too.

In a few instances as a seller, I have encountered buyers who don't honor their bid. Ebay has always credited my account for any fees that were taken.I guess the only complaint I have about ebay at this point is as a seller. Their fees have skyrocketed. It's almost not worth selling small ticket items because of this. If I was allowed to take away half a star for this I would, but you can't beat the great deals to be had when bidding on an item.

2018,"I started using ebay approximately 10 years ago as a buyer .. then as a seller. It's a good website ... I've got many good deals, few bad deals because I'm really picky 'trusting' my seller. 

you need to do some research 'from whom' you're going to buy your item. if they have zero feedbacks and no history at all .. it's kinda risky to buy from that person. I like reading the seller ME page .. and see what they say about themselves. 

Just be very careful and know when to stop bidding .. coz otherwise instead of saving money .. u'll end up losing money. ALSO .. know the 'retail price' first before thinking an item is CHEAP .. coz with all those bid war .. people forget that the item end up cheaper if you just go to the store and buy it there, they get caught up with the 'bidding war' and want to win the item so bad w/out thinking that the price starting to pass the 'retail price' ..",5,“I started using ebay approximately 10 years ago as...”

I like the fact that we are buyer and seller protected but their charges to the seller are getting larger and larger as the years go by.  The best way to pay or get paid with ebay is through pay pal but they also have charges to the seller.   

One thing I would recommend is to not buy shoes on ebay.  Usually they are seconds and don't fit correctly.

Make sure, before you buy, to read each seller's feedback list.  Sometimes it's worth it to spend a little extra on something that is listed by multiple sellers to know you are buying from a good and reputable seller.  Just yesterday I had that choice and chose to spend an extra $10 on something because that particular seller had 100% positive feedback.

2035,"www.ebay.com can be a great place to shop for many things, including toys.  I've recently started shopping for toys at www.ebay.com, so from what I'd like to share what I've learned as an amateur batty bidder to help you get started.

When starting out on www.ebay.com, you'll want to link your account to a Paypal account.  Most every transaction you make will be through Paypal, and you can either do instant bank transfers or pay by credit card.  I would recommend paying by credit card, as that can add a thin layer of protection if a purchase should go awry.

When shopping on ebay, you have to do a lot of research.  For example, let's say you're shopping for a toy.  First, you want to know every little thing about the toy.  You want to know what the toy looks like, what the box art looks like, when it was issued, what it includes -- everything.  When you're shopping on ebay you will be buying loose or sealed items, usually looking at user uploaded photos of the product should they be provided.  You need to know exactly what you want so you can match them with the photos and their description.

Now, let's say you've found your item.  You want to look at several different things when evaluating the posted product:

*The shipping and handling -- make sure the shipping cost is reasonable for the product.  If it's ridiculously high, then it's highly suspicious.

*The photos, if provided.  Look at them closely if you're able to zoom in.  Check to see if there's any damage to the toy.  See if there's anything missing with the toy.

*Read the description of the toy.  Read it twice.  If they mention any problems with your product, you may want to consider contacting the seller to get specifics.  If they mention loose joints on an action figure, ask them which ones.  If they mention scratched stickers or paint and you can't see them in the photo, contact them for more information.

Do not be afraid to contact the seller and ask them questions!  You're dealing with regular peeps on E-bay and not all of them have a professional portrayal of what they're selling.

*Check the seller's feedback.  When people make purchases or sell things, they can be left by feedback from other users.  If the person has recent negative feedback or no feedback at all, you should avoid them.

Now, there's a variety of things about bids and buying you should know about.  I doubt I'll cover it all, but hopefully I can get the bread and butter out of the way for ya.

There's two common ways to acquire something off of ebay.  For one, there is the ""buy it now"" option, which is straightforward.  By clicking on this option you commit to buying the product.  It does not pay for it immediately.  However, I recommend paying for your purchase, soon.

And then there's the auction dealie.  Ebay works by using incremental bidding.  What does this mean?  Since it isn't a live auction, per say, they conveniently have everyone place a ""max bid"".  In other words, they place the maximum amount they're willing to bid during an auction.  It will then place a bid in order to keep you at the top bid, while calculating everyone else's max bids.  That is unless the bidding exceeds your max bid.

For example, a ""Shiny-Thingy-Ma-Doo"" may be bidding at $0.99.  You find yourself willing to pay $10.00, so you place that as your maximum bid.  The bid then shoots up to $2.00 or what not -- it places a bid on your behalf in an increment to make you the top bidder.

There is some beauty to this.  Let's say the auction ends at $2.00 dollars, with you at the top bid.  You'll only have to pay $2.00, and not the full $10.00 you placed as your max bid.

When placing your max bid however, here's a tip.  Don't make it an even, guessable number.  You can lose a bid by a couple of cents!  If you are willing to bay $10.00, make it $12.87 or some bizarre number.  By adding a few dollars and cents, you increase the chances of winning a bid should no one's max exceed yours.  A lame schmo might place $10.00, or a more clever schmo might place $11.90, but by adding those few radical dollars you've topped them all.

Finally, let's talk about how to place a bid.  There's the decried method of ""sniping"", which is manually or automatically placing your max bid in the last few moments of an auction.  Sniping is a great, if not rueful method to win an auction.

*It prevents people from increasing their max bid should yours top theirs.
*It prevents a bid war from occurring -- people inflating the price as they bid back and forth over and item.
*Fewer bids on an item means it has less attention.  An item with lots of bids on it will attract more attention, which means more bidders and more money.

To learn how to snipe I suggest you scour the interwebs for more guides.  It can be done manually or with utilities.  As for what utility I use to snipe, I recommend www.myibay.com .  They can place bids for you without you having to be present.  I've found them to be reliable.

I invite more experienced ebayers to comment.  I recommend reading up on more guides if you're new to ebay or toy shopping, just as well.  But, I hope that this little guide can help you on your merry way to happy shopping on ebay -- for it's a great auction house indeed.",5,“www.ebay.com can be a great place to shop for many...”

I never had a major dispute as a buyer or ANY dispute as a seller. Just read the descriptions and give accurate descriptions and Ebay will work out just great. The Seller fees are a little higher than I'd prefer but all and all I do thousands of dollars of purchasing and selling, I have 100% and I'm very thankful for Ebay!!!! My suggestion is to find sellers you've done business with in the past and go through them in the future, build a network of trustworthy sellers and you'll never have even a minor dispute on ebay. Hope this helps.  P.S.S I won't purchase from anyone with feedback less than 98%-99%.

2049,"Ebay is by far the best auction site for many items on the web.  I have been a member for several years.  Over time, you learn how to avoid the bad sellers.  As has been indicated, the feedback listings are a good way to avoid sellers you don't want to buy from.  A few hints on making sure you always get your stuff quickly:   Look for sellers with 100% positive feedback.  This really isn't that hard on most items, I have found.  READ the feedback.  A lot of times people will provide a positive or neutral feedback for a seller who is somewhat sluggish in getting stuff shipped.  I hate slow shipping, even when the item is sent within a day of you winning the bid.  When buying a video game system, be careful.  The best option is usually to buy from a seller who has an ebay shop and seems to have a rather large professional looking ebay listing.  These sellers tend to sell hundreds of units and are generally the most reliable sellers of new items like this and used items.

Finally, ALWAYS use Paypal.  If a seller does not accept paypal, something is up.  It is the simplest and easiest method of paying for an auction won on ebay.  It also has a very good dispute resolution process in case an item you pay for is never delivered.  The fact that Paypal is owned by ebay makes it even better.

So simply put, avoid sellers with slow shipping, regardless of feedback...it can be deceptive, buy certain items from sellers with good looking listings, and finally ALWAYS use paypal to pay for your purchases.",5,“Ebay is by far the best auction site for many items...”

SUGGESTIONS:
-Only bid/purchase items from sellers with 98%+ feedback
-Don't buy things from a brand new user
-ONLY use PayPal to pay
-ALWAYS read the entire auction before bidding.  Don't blame the seller for only accepting Paypal, fees, or taxes that you did not know about because you did not fully read the auction first.
