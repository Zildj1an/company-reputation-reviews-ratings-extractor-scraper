0,"Taskers don't know what they are doing most of the time, ripping customers off and taking hours and hours to do a job just for the $20 an hour mentality(which in tern is very low to work with on this app taking into account the number of available jobs and how some people take 8+ hours). I don't recommend for anyone to work for or with TaskRabbit, especially for IKEA furniture. You are left with a damaged product after someone's side hussle on the weekend when skilled workers from IKEA were put off from work. I think the app had good intentions at the beginning but so far now have ruined customer's experience at this store(at least in my city not talking about all). Only select from this app if you really can't use a screwdriver, but be aware of fake reviews, way too cheap jobs. Have a nice day.",1,“One star is generous!!”

2,I have probably spent £1000 for paying for a three pieces of furniture to be set up and a mirror to be mounted.

13,"If I could give zero stars, I would. We booked a tasker to put up several large shelves. He was here for a very short amount of time but the shelves appeared to be fine, so we didn't mind. The next day I woke up to find one of the shelves on the floor, surrounded by chunks of plaster and paint. There were also several holes in our wall. The brackets had not been secured properly at all.
It's been a nightmare to deal with TR's ""customer services"". After several days of trying to get a response, they finally emailed back to offer us a discount on the cost of another mounting/installation task. There was no mention of fixing the damage caused. They clearly expected us to arrange it and pay for it ourselves. We rejected their voucher and demanded they pay for the repair costs but have been met with silence. Another shelf has since fallen down, causing yet more damage. 
I have no faith in their complaints procedure so although we are out of pocket, it looks like we'll have to cut our losses and move on. It goes without saying that I will never use TR again and would strongly discourage anyone else from doing so. They are complete charlatans.",1,“Appalling service” 
14,"It's been three weeks now since I've signed up for Tasker and setup my profile, of course that also includes paying 20$ upfront (they claim it's the fee for the background check). I have been emailing them regarding my status, unfortunately I have only recieved a general automated message but haven't heard from them regarding my status ever since. Fortunately I was able to get a hold of the customer service after a lengthy process (you can only contact them by phone if it's an emergency), in which the representative said to me that my issue has already been forwarded to the befitting department (at least they could have let me know this before, all those times I've been trying to enquire about my status). When I asked them if there is any way I can get in touch with that special department so I have an idea of how much longer it's gonna take and why it's taking so long, they told me no your issue is already with the internal department(all of this conversation was being done in between long hold times). So how am I supposed to know my status???. At the end I inquired if I can have my refund since I don't see any advancement in my case and it seems like nothing is being done, they said that was a non refundable fee that's used for the background check, well then how come I didn't recieve a copy of my background check since that is legally our right and I clicked on that option as I was signing up (all this being talked with holds in between). Finally I decided this is wasting too much of my time and the most feasible thing for me to do for now is to leave a review so others can be aware of this, it may not happen to you but it does happen to a lot of people. Also I am using handypro now and so far they're ok (they are also hard to get in touch with but so far I haven't had the need to contact them). I was actually surprised with their sign up process and how I was able to work right away. Although the layout of the Tasker app is much better, also I think the pay and the variety of jobs you get through Tasker is a bit more but their management, from my experience, is horrible! I hope they can fix this up.",1,“Horrible management!”

17,"The zero stars rating would of been more appropriate, with one star being generous.  The delivery model is all wrong, there are limited taskers and the ones that engage you just do it to see where, when and how and after lots of photo sending.  And then they decide they can't do the task, aren't qualified with no ability to rate their poor engagement.

I have attempted to use the app/service 3 times and I am done.  With no success in TaskRabbit ever delivery anything not even customer service.  Takes 7-10 days to get a respond to an email.

Once job was completed, I opened my claim with TaskRabbit and attached photos. I had the hardest time to get a response and when they finally responded they claimed they bare no responsibility and that I had to go through my own insurance company.

Money is not the issue, I could pay out of pocket to fix it, my insurance would also cover the full cost if I wanted them to, but why would I risk higher monthly rates from insurance for something I could pay for out of pocket one-time?

This is just so ridiculous to book someone and the person does not show up, lies, and then advertises his business. You should reject him as being a tasker and no longer allow him to be on your site.

I tried calling but their phone is permanently overwelmed with calls according to the voice message and you are directed to their web site.
I sent numerous emails to them with no response to this day. I even had the bank investigate and the response from the bank was that I had approved the transaction therefore I was responsible for the charge.
Today I tried to sent them a message through their web site and it was thrown off 3 times after 3 rewrites and attempts to send it.
I have no other recourse and was wrongfully charged for a service that could not be performed. I will never recommend this company and will do everything I can to stop other people from being ripped off by them.

59,"I scheduled a Tasker named Kristina.  At the time she was scheduled, she texted me and asked to come an hour and a half later.  I said fine.  At the appointed time, a young man showed up and told me that Kristina sent him. Reluctantly I let him in.  Within 20 minutes it was beyond clear that this kid could clean like everyone else's kid.  Not at all, possibly making things worse.  I told him originally that I was not happy that Kristina sent him in her place and that was not legit.  After he told me he was going to put ""upholstery cleaner"" on my expensive Dania sectional, I told him to leave.  Every spot where he ""cleaned"" was still dirty.  He pushed dirt around and left debris and slime in all my corners.   I texted Task Rabbit, no help.  I texted the original Tasker, Kristine, who offered to just cancel the service but I told her I wanted her to be accountable for what she'd done, so she said she was on her way.  She never showed, and now she is claiming she did come, and had the nerve to charge me for two hours of service, claimed she was in my house and cleaned it, and said I was lying. I have security video that proves otherwise.   I live in Portland Oregon, home of the criminal transients, and I was just scammed by them via Task Rabbit.  I need this person's information, since they have mine, and no help or response from TaskRabbit.   I am pursuing this legally.  Be extremely careful, TaskRabbit does not vet their Taskers.

64,"I applied to be a tasker with this company.  The site suggested several types of jobs that were the most requested.  After going thru a VERY lengthy process, they charged me $20 to join the community.  Only THEN did they inform me that there were NO jobs in my area!  If this were a legitimate company, the site would've checked my zipcode and informed me of the lack of opportunities BEFORE taking my money!  It is nothing but a money grub!",1,“Company is a SCAM” 
65,"After starting to discuss the job with the tasker, he told me that TaskRabbit app does overlapping and he has only an hour for the job. An hour should have been fine for the task but I did ask if that would be enough - since I'm not a handyman and I wanted to confirm that the job could be done in that time frame. The tasker confirmed there is enough time, and he's experienced so it's not going to be a problem. After confirming that the tasker is coming tomorrow I didn't even think that something might go wrong.
The next morning I prepared everything and was waiting for the tasker to come. Just a few minutes before the scheduled time I received a message saying: ""We're sorry, the Tasker Name couldn't help with this task. Select a new Tasker.""
I never really leave bad reviews - maybe there was an emergency (although I highly doubt that). However, the overlapping of jobs in that type of service is definitely not acceptable. If the app does that, it has to be fixed! The other thing that got me really angry was that the message I received literally last minute was so dull - I value my time and time of others and I don't have time to sit and ""select a new Tasker"" when I got a last minute cancellation. If I knew that this overlapping or whatever will cause the cancellation last minute, I would just simply find another tasker who might have actually shown up for the job.
The idea of the application is great, but the delivery is not up there yet. Notifying a client at least an hour before the cancellation would be the least the company could do. Whenever you make an appointment for any service in case you don't show up, you're still being charged, which is fair because you have to value someone else time. Otherwise, I don't really see the difference between the app and just randomly finding a guy on the internet and hoping he will show up for the job.",1,“Last Minute Cancellation” 
66,I booked them through IKEA. What a nightmare! There is no phone number where you can call them for customer service you have to download an app and communicate through the app and the website. I am 38 weeks pregnant and hired them to assemble my IKEA dresser. I had them scheduled three separate days and times because they kept canceling on me. They are overpriced and Super flaky. Buyer beware!!!,1,"“Horrible! Hire someone else!!!! Booked through IKEA, they canceled on me 3 times!” "
67,"I had booked a handyman through task rabbit to help me assemble some furniture. The delivery company delayed the delivery so I informed him ahead of time that our appointment would need to be delayed and that the time depended on the delivery. Next thing I know I received a message saying that he had to cancel our appointment, because he couldn't wait. 
A week later I get an email from task rabbit saying that I was charged a one hour cancellation fee, because I cancelled within the 24 hour limit! Despite the fact that I didn't cancel the appointment but the tasker did. 
I have been trying for two days to contact them over the phone, their lines are down because ""they experience heavier than usual volume!"", for two days! I emailed them and also contacted them through their website, nobody even replied. Nobody picks up the phone, or answered the emails.

68,So I needed 2 bushes dug out of my front yard and decided to give task rabbit a shot. As a new customer I followed their directions to set up my account and this did include entering my home address and zip code. I was given a number of potential taskers who supposedly did work in my area and booked the job. When the young man I hired did not show up as scheduled I contacted him thru the app and discovered he had just arrived. The problem was he was in Oklahoma and I was in Massachusetts. Needless to say I am flummoxed as to how a service can claim to pair up clients needing work done with local folks needing work and not be able to figure out where everybody lives. And there is no phone customer service only email to rage into the electronic void. They better not charge me for their stupidity.,1,“Live in one state and paired with help 2000 miles away”

He did the job, no real issues the cost was a little more than I expected to move a couch and a chaise lounge from Harlem to Brooklyn but he did the job BUT Task Rabbit charged me twice for the job!

I can't use them again. I can't afford to do so. I have submitted a claim against them from my bank so I can get that credit back to my account.

She charged us for 2.5h (Maths must not be her strength), which raised an invoice of £55. She claimed she was never late but that she was ringing the bell and nobody opened the door (which is obviously not true). And she still charged us double even if she didn't even work for the agreed hour. Three works later, I am still waiting for the invoice to be amended.

72,"We hired a TaskRabbit Tasker (Matt F) to help us load a truck for a move in NYC. He was tasked with loading the truck and then returning the next day to remove any waste items, a broken down bed, some old garden chairs, packing materials.

Matt F failed to load a mirrored cabinet that contained jewelry despite the fact that it was already packaged up and left in the middle of the room to be loaded. The next day when he returned to throw away the waste items he found the packaged mirror and sent a message saying that it had been missed off the truck. Before we had a chance to respond he threw it in the trash at our apartment block and it was removed by the city sanitation guys. He did not ask what was to be done with it, nor did he leave it with someone at the front desk in the apartment. He took it upon himself to make the decision to throw it away.

We have since been in a long and protracted claims process with TaskRabbit who claim to have a 'Happiness Pledge and insure jobs up to $1 million. A full inventory of the items lost was sent across to them and copies of the messages with Matt F in which he ADMITS he knew the item had been left off the truck and that he threw it away without asking consent to do so.

TaskRabbit says they wont cover the loss because its 'a miscommunication between users. There was zero miscommunication. Matt F was tasked with loading the item. He admits he failed to load it. He also admits he threw it away without asking permission to do so. We provided them with the evidence of his admission of guilt. Its a clear example of negligence even by their own terms and conditions which we have read  carefully. 

The company is a joke. If they promise to insure tasks to protect the users from idiots like Matt F then they should do so. Most of the items are irreplaceable but they should at least pay out towards the cost of replacing them. They were provided with a picture of every item that was in the cabinet and what it looked like when it was packaged.

76,"Let me start off by saying that I tried to give TaskRabbit a zero star for their customer support, but this site forced me to select at least one star. Basically, all this company does is match the customer to a Tasker to do your task. Once the task is completed, they charge your account and that is where their job is done. TaskRabbit does absolutely nothing to take care of a customer if the Tasker just chooses to blow off the task. There is a telephone number on the internet, but if you call it, the message says to use their email and chat. I scheduled a Tasker who, by the way, had 100% positive reviews by many customers, to pickup our company lunch and deliver to us. He just failed to show up, did not cancel ahead, did not respond to my messages and phone calls. I had to pickup the lunch (lunch was an hour late and I spent a wasted hour out of my day). I sent SEVERAL messages in all formats to TaskRabbit to request resolution and they just didn't care enough to respond in any way. When I had returned to my office with the lunch and saw that the task was still open, I tried to cancel it so the Tasker could not charge me and TaskRabbit said they would charge me for an hour since I was cancelling within 24 hours. How does that work since it was AFTER the task was supposed to have been completed? Twelve hours after the task was supposed to have been done, I received a cancellation asking if I wanted to schedule another Tasker. Are you kidding me? Basically, the customer is at the mercy of the Tasker, who is some random person that you select from a list showing names, rates, and reviews. Some Taskers are exceptional, some OK, and as you can see from my review and others that I read on this site, some just don't give a hoot, since we don't know who they are and can't ""fire"" them. The real kicker is that it is not possible to leave a review of the Tasker who just failed to show up. You can only review them after they complete your task. So, let the buyer beware......",1,“Zero customer support”

No response, just Task cancellation emails 20 hours later. What the heck?? Their terms and conditions indicate they can charge me for a last minute cancellation. What about me? What is my recourse??

So right at the start of signup, they charge a $25 registration fee. Oookay...I probably should have said never mind right there, but figured if I can charge $20 an hour for work, then I'd pay for it in two hours.

After that, you have to complete a 45-minute to 1-hour training course involving videos and quiz questions on how to use the app, how to behave as a tasker, etc. They give you a deadline of a few days to do this, and during this process they claim they will review and approve your account within a couple of business days and get you going!

(Side note, the last section of the training course becomes text only, and offers a link to the Help Files for additional information on the subject, but the link is broken, and the questions were just vague enough that I got them wrong and had to repeat the quiz about five times to get it right!)

So I finished this process and waited three days. Today I checked their Help files on ""When will my registration be processed?"" and found this:

""We receive a high volume of registrations, and we process registrations on a rolling basis as marketplace demand increases, opening up space in the Tasker community.

It only had the blanket on the top part, so this part was directly on the driveway, where there's grease and dirt, etc. I said something, but he ignored me. Then later, he said that he normally protects the entire thing, but since the sofa was used, he didn't bother. NICE!!! So the sofa ended up having black grease stains on that side because of it!

The bottom line is, he still was not there at 9:00 pm and I texted and said don't bother coming. His texts in response were so rude and unprofessional. Stating that I wasted 3 hours of his time--he wasted five hours of my time. I contacted TaskRabbit on line to complain asking for an apology from both the company and the Tasker. I got a form letter offering me $25 off to try them again. When I called today I was told the message came from a Senior Advisor and they do not take phone calls.

As I had been advised by their customer service department in the past, I told the tasker he could check with customer service to verify my identity and age as they notated my account, The tasker said it was no problem, he would be leaving shortly to go get my groceries. We had a few chats in between and about the time I was expecting him to show up, TR sent me a message they I had cancelled. WTF? I called and was told that they couldn't deliver cigarettes so they cancelled the whole task. No phone call, just an email, after they cancelled, with a lame explaination. I had already waited an hour and a half and now they wanted me to reschedule to reorder the groceries and wait another hour or so.

The person who accepted this task ended up unnecessarily ripping my newly installed carpeting. He assured me that Task Rabbit's insurance would cover the repair of my carpet. At first, task rabbit support was responsive and guaranteed that they would make this right. After sending them the quote to have my carpet repaired, they became impossible to get a hold of.

We of course contacted Task Rabbit who claims to have insurance against these types of issues that were caused by their Taskers. After over a MONTH of waiting and emails, they claimed that it ""does not qualify"" under their insurance policy. 

Let me make this very clear - Task Rabbit's ""guarantee"" or ""insurance"" is completely fraudulent. They WILL NOT protect you in the event that someone destroys your property.

However, the company builds up this image of it being a new and exciting way to connect people and the mantra of 'neighbour help neighbour' idea is a load of rubbish. The company take a cut of 30% on your 'first task' with a client. Then say its only 15%  for that same client on repeat tasks. However, most people using this service don't have multiple tasks needing done repeatedly. They use it, unfortunately, to find someone cheap and quick to do their task, even if that is building shelves, cleaning the house or knocking down walls and building a new window. The expectations are so high most of the time, and too many people use it to find handymen and builders (as that is what task rabbit is used most for) to pay them the very minimum. My partner is an elite tasker, which happens after you do a lot of tasks over the course of a month for example. He has made task rabbit a LOT of money. Thousands of pounds. He works full time and averages about 3 or 4 tasks a day. Every new client he books in doesn't realise they are paying 30% more to the company. My partner has not been paid about £5,000 for all his work over three months. He has attempted to contact task rabbit and is met with automated voice calls and emails sent to him three days later. He has time and time again tried to make contact with this business and their attitude seems to be that his lack of pay is 'not an emergency'. Do not use task rabbit.

131,"Athough TaskRabbit may be the idea go to solution for people on the go, they are lacking plain ole professionalism. Professional etiquette is of great importance not only today, but everyday. As a customer service applicant for TaskRabbit,  I was put through a grueling interview process, I was asked to pick three possible time slots for each one of the 5 interviews I had. Not to mention that on my final interview I was asked to meet the interviewer in a lobby of a local hotel where he had to look for a ""quiet"" spot to conduct the interview and when it was all over, I had to pay parking. Here's a clue, when you are a company who is making millions, you should conduct yourselves as such. Your applicants are obviously looking for a job, considering there is no guarantee who you will select, let's make sure that are spared any expense. Paying for parking is only worth it if you know you are going to start work within the week. I have had the privilege of working jobs that require security clearance and have never been through such a exhausting process. I would advise that you narrow your interview process down to reasonable. The interview process was not only physically draining, it was emotionally draining as well. When you are in the hiring stages, your applicants hope to become employees. I think it is ok to stop your interview process before it gets to the level of obsessive. As an entry level employee two maybe three interviews are more than enough. Anymore after that should remain reserved for applicants seeking positions as executives. Last but not least, it was evident by the interviewers statements that I was not the one. As I previously mentioned the interviewing process was extreme, in that case once your selection has been made, extend a note of why this particular candidate was not chosen. A substantial amount of time was given to the TaskRabbit team over the course of two weeks, I don't think understanding what eliminated a top candidate is too much to ask. With that being said, when a up and coming business handles their internal affairs this way, it makes you wonder what makes best suited to serve the world externally.",1,“Unprofessional”

Both of these guys had great reviews and decent communication at first, but then they bailed.  There's no accountability for them either -- TaskRabbit doesn't seem to allow you to leave subjective reviews for these people.  The most I could do was click a button that said the 2nd Tasker was a no-call, no-show.  Very poorly run business.  What a disappointment.  And talk about leaving someone high and dry!",2,"“Seems helpful and professional, but then ZERO accountability from taskers who ghost me!” "
154,"Excitedly I hired a handymen in 2014 as I moved into a new apt to assemble a few Ikea things. 

Guy #1 was cheap, then I learned why. He had a mental issue..was slow in speech and thinking. I'm all for putting challenged ppl to work, but in jobs that are well-suited. He couldn't finish the job..I had to step in and tell him what to do. Um, not what I was paying for, but I felt for him. Had to then hire a new guy instead..

Guy #2  who seemed great. Fast. Nice. But he had to return to fix a piece of furniture that in days got wobbly and crooked. Seemed ok then, but in months it happened again. This was not a cheap Ikea piece, I've not had pieces I'VE assembled over the years do this. 

Guy #3 was a 'mounter'...I needed a curtain wire and shelves mounted. I chose a guy who ""built a whole house w/his dad"" once. This guy had to know, right? Was a bit more pricey. But no. In weeks my curtain wire began to pull and bend at the contact points, he returned and spent like 2 hours redoing it all. After several months I noticed my 1 of 4 shelves he installed was in fact upside down so things slid off from the incorrect slant I kept cursing. And a year later, when painting, I went to remove a wall mirror to paint, and the idiot used some freak screws which you need to go buy a special bit for. WTF? And then, of course, a year later, my curtains began to sag again (used these same wire cables before n they were fine for OVER 5 years). So I hired....

Guy #4. He was older and more experienced, I'm trying! And at the top price..this must work, right? And 6 mo's later, curtain wire seems ok...we'll see. 

Summary: By now, 2 years on, 6 out of 8 furniture assemblies and wall mounts have issues. VERY disappointing and disheartening. 

I recommend you DO NOT use TaskRabbit for any handymen, rather check at your local hardware store..they always have cards for local ones they hear good things about. I've loved one of mine, I just live in a different city now.

Only thing I've liked Taskrabbit for is accompanying me home from a small outpatient medical procedure as was required by law. But that's a no-brainer job. 

And now I'm searching for an errand person and see it's $46/hr. WTF? It's a 20 min errand. I'll hire a regular messenger service for $25 thank you very much. 

Disappointed in what in concept seems brilliant.

155,"I applied to be a Task Rabbit, followed up a couple weeks later.  I received a scripted response (tacky) that not everyone who applies is hired because they don't want to saturate the market.  I was surprised and disappointed as I'd heard very good things about them.  No recommendations from me",2,“Task Rabbit” 
156,"I've worked for task rabbit for maybe three months, when things are fine and you complete your tasks well enough, all is ok, but as soon as there's even the slightest problem which may not even be your fault, the start messing around with your account, for instance; you can book your hours or expenses, you cannot contact them for support, even worse, then reduce your ratings for no aparant reason.",2,“They fiddle with your account” 
157,"My girlfriends and I hired a guy in LA on TaskRabbit to move and hang a couple things.  The platform of the app is easy and very convenient.  The guy arrived on-time and was eager.  He did a great job and for those reasons TaskRabbit is a fine service.

However, this guy was super attentive to all the girls.  Definitely checked all of us out over and over again like almost to the point where he must have never seen females before.  He tried to friend one of us on InstaGram and gave his cell phone number too letting us know that he does personal jobs on the side.  He inserted himself in our conversations and in my opinion was overly friendly.

I checked out his reviews before hiring and they are all mostly great but I did think it was odd that his reviews have 99% women on them.  Now after meeting him and watching his interactions it must be his goal to only have women hire him.  Its more than a little unprofessional and weird that the handyman you hire comes into your home and is flirty and even goes to the lengths of offering private help and starts following you on a social media site.... CREEPY!  

I know that ""boys will be boys"" but whoever thinks that a girl is going to pick up a guy from a website like this is hysterical to me!  TaskRabbit should have rules for their hired help that comes to your home and ask them to be less sexually motivated!",2,“It's a task site not a dating website” 
158,"I thought the idea of TaskRabbit was to make your life easier - subcontract out the tasks you don't want to do. But what happens instead is that you replace the task you didn't want to do with a HUGE HASSLE in dealing with TaskRabbit, and sometimes you end up doing the task you didn't want to do because you run out of time to find a TaskRabbit.
I used TaskRabbit on-and-off for a few years. In the early years, I loved them. Then they changed the process (and changed it again) and it has never even approached ""okay"" since then. All the ""taskers"" I've used have been between ""adequate"" and ""great"" (although I've heard horror stories), but I've also had multiple tasks canceled because the assigned tasker didn't want to do it, and sometimes I spent more time on TaskRabbit trying to get someone to clean my house than if I would've just cleaned the house myself! 
The platform is horrible: taskers hate it, clients hate it... I have no idea for whose convenience any of this is designed.
Their customer service is unimpressive. After reading other reviews, I feel lucky that they even responded to complaints. I had one rep who was, um, not very bright, as she thought a $10 credit that was issued months *before* the task I was complaining about, was actually the $15 credit I had been promised. Yes, they have credited me multiple times for tasks that were overcharged, or just such an omnishambles that they felt they had to make it up to me. Again, judging from the other reviews, I'm the lucky one, in that I even got a credit for my fiascos. Still, I've decided that it's not worth the hassle of dealing with TaskRabbit - I'd rather just do my task myself, or take my chances with Craigslist.",2,"“Makes life harder, not easier” "
159,"While some rabbits did OK jobs, I had several rabbits who arrived late to tasks which they signed up for and caused extreme inconveniences. Another rabbit was worse - basically leaves a task open for weeks and months and did not even respond to emails or inquiries until I contacted the taskrabbit customer service asking for refund. Task ended up not completed according to the request but I was still charged with the expense. It should be highlighted as huge warnings prior to any usage that the company does not offer any type or sense of liability or responsibility over the actual completion and/or quality of the completion of the tasks (making the system prone to rabbits taking advantage of this to get away with doing sloppy job). Also, the company does not allow tasker to write reviews on the rabbit who did poor jobs, they would simply remove the customer displaying any dissatisfaction with the service to avoid issuing refund or getting negative reviews.",2,“Not good experience” 
160,"If you are a Tasker and have a sick kid,  and have to cancel early more than a once or twice of times, a nameless person in Policies dep will politely fire you by email and you have no recourse.  Even if you've done stellar work consistently, tough beans.  Do No let TR be your only gig, bc though they have some pros,  they have little understanding when it comes to such things.  As they say, such conduct  degrades the TR platform"" and with their magic anonymous email wand the flow of jobs vanishes w no warning.",2,“Best for Taskers w/o kids” 
161,Would not recommend TaskRabbit. I hired a couple people from there. Biggest problem is that the people who did the work enter and were paid for their hours without my approval. There is no mechanism for the person hiring to approve hours. Free for all on my credit card.,2,“Overcharges difficult to control” 
162,"I hired a task worker to assemble a bed. I gave details on the size and structure (queen solid wood bed) the task worker accepted. He was courteous and polite however he requested I help him a few times. I could not with a 18 month old running around, besides if I could do it myself I would have. To top off the stress the headboard fell hard on the bed frame and it broke the headboard in 2 pieces. In summary the task worker went to the hardware store bought a few screws and hooks and pretty much screwed the damaged wood back together. Of course I allowed him to because I needed some where to sleep however I reported the incident and expected a resolution compensating for the damaged item . Taskrabbit only offered reimbursement on the services charged. I am currently now questioning what exactly was the resolution to my damaged item. I do not recommend them for any job and believe their policy & procedure in regards to damaged items is false advertisement.",2,“Horrible experience” 
163,"I was tired of Taskrabbit taking such a big cut of my rate . I built a new app called ""Dayworks ""
Dayworks is free to workers and only charges $1.99 to hire . Right now it is just mainly for construction trade but more categories will be coming soon . We are available on Google Play and iTunes . You can also check out dayworks.net .",2,“There is a better way !!!” 
164,"I needed to have a boxspring hauled to the local dump so I posted a request on TaskRabbit. No one responded to my offer of $60, plus an additional $17 for dump fees.  The dump is less than 5 miles away.  Finally a kind gentleman on TaskRabbit was willing to haul it away for $100 + $17.  TaskRabbit charges 20% which is quite a large cut.  I decided to give Craigslist a try and found someone right away who offered to dump it for $40 total.  TaskRabbit is probably better suited for when you need to read the reviews of the taskers, otherwise their pricing is not very competitive in the marketplace.

The TaskRabbit website is also a bit inflexible in functionality.  I wanted to specify a range of time for the task, but you have to lock down on a specific day/time.  I liked the original website, where taskers would bid on your task and you pick the best offer.",2,“I needed to have a boxspring hauled to the local dump...”

Over all I would have to say that if I wanted something done, or if looking for temp employment I would go to Craigslist.",2,“As a former Taskrabbit I can honestly say that I did...” 
167,"Their model is flawed because you cannot rate a taskrabbit unless they show up. If they stand you up, the job was never completed, so they can maintain their 4 or 5-star rating while you get the shaft. My experience: I always post a fee that works out to at least 25/hr for minimal skill jobs. My first experience hiring a TaskRabbit was great. My second experience was abysmal, because the person who accepted the job never showed, never contacted me, and never replied to my texts. I had a short window of time to get this done and was left hanging all day. Task Rabbit customer service said I could cancel the task and I'd get a $10 credit for the next job, but had no answer when I asked how can I add this feedback to the taskrabbit's evaluation. So ... buyer beware. Have a backup plan. You can't rely on a taskrabbit's ratings.

Even when I've made a ""good"" bid per task rabbit's ""good bid ding"" for making a bid at or less than what the job poster wants to pay, the job winds up going to the lowest bidder, often up to half of what my supposed ""good bid"" was.  Posters always underestimate the work they need done and I've done many tasks for less than minimum wage.  Why?  Because task rabbit rates the task rabbit workers and if you don't do it, the poster can complain and you look like the bad guy.  Task rabbit.com is the winner, next the poster who gets cheap college educated labor, the rabbits?

On TaskRabbit you can name your price and the Runners will do anything from moving items, shopping for you, to taking your clothes to the cleaners.  All the Runners are immediately reviewed after completing the task, so you can easily tell who is reliable and trustworthy.

On the flip side, signing up to be a Runner is a great way to generate some extra cash if you are unemployed, self-employed, or just happen to have a lot of free time.  A lot of the Runners today happen to be stay-at-home parents looking for part-time work.

The tasker that showed up was incredibly professional and polite, but got my furniture assembled in the advertised time.  Couldn't have been happier.

In fact, I found the same guy, through the taskrabbit app and hired him to come back and do some general handyman stuff around the house.  Amazing!  This guy could do it all.  And do it well.  I am overly ecstatic about the amazing value of this service.
