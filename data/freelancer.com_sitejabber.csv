Bottom line.  Don't let these companies take advantage.  They try to robo charge your credit card after they get your credit card info and provide little to no help after the robo charge when you try to dispute it or cancel whatever the charge was for.  Always report it to your credit card company as a fraudulent charge",1,“Update”

2,"First, let me qualify myself by sharing that I'm a fulltime freelancer and that I use other sites and have extraordinary results. I am a top provider with hundreds of satisfied clients around the globe, so I speak from experience.

I found Freelancer.com to be entirely useless, ineffectual and a total waste of time. When I closed my account, these gypsies continued to bill my PayPal and help themselves to MY MONEY; and they had the gall to act clueless for a MONTH as I endured a half-dozen back and forth email exchanges. As I tried to get these brainless airheads to return the money they took from me, I got the feeling that they may be trained to drag out the return/credit process as long as possible in order to hold onto the funds. Basically, Freelancer.com, from my perspective, offers ZILCH value for a legitimate fulltime freelancer. The site is antiquated, unsophisticated, and very unprofessional; and from my experience, I have no trust or faith in Freelancer.com. (*Also, take note of others' complaints that the site holds onto freelancers' money for a long time before remitting it. Had I seen THAT before, I'd have never bothered to explore the site, in the first place.) It's just my opinion, but I suspect that we'll see this site will fall on its face and go away before long. There's no way such a poorly-run, unprofessional, desperate business can sustain itself --",1,“Worthless! PLUS they kept billing me AFTER I closed my account!”

I asked support to cancel for me and send me confirmation. she then directed me to a more specific area in the link that still did not show the trial having been cancelled. I'm told to disregard to invoice. After this went on for to long, I closed my account. I've never had a company not give me any type of confirmation that a subscription was successfully cancelled. Feels very shady to me.",1,“Could not get confirmation of successful cancellation of free trial”

Anyway, this is a big joke.

There are A LOT of fake employers and projects. Around 60% are fake.

They have FEE for both employer and employee REGARDLESS if you get paid or not.

My first project on freelancer, my emoloyer insisted to submit the work first before the milestone. The milestone should be created once awarded to avoid these scammers.

You get ridiculous fees and you are the one to pay for the fees in sending. Imagine paying a $5 project fee with a pay of 30$ then you get another $0.42 because of the transaction fee. Really?",1,“Scammers”

However, If you reside in some 3rd world country, you can always get a job with freelancer that pays 15 cents/hour for writing fake reviews!

I reach the dispute forum and they say client is not satisfied and he closed the project.  who the hell will judge what i have done and what is pending.  

These people just need 5% that's it. my suggestion to my friends never apply for jobs who don't deposit money and on allotment of project request full amount as milestone and then start the work.

10,"In two words - STAY AWAY from these guys. I paid for their recruiters service and an NDA service a total of USD 30/- I posted a very descriptive job on their site explaining what I wanted. Their recruiter Giselle didn't even spend one minute reading it, and gave ignorance away with the Qs she asked me and her assessment of my requirement. This put me off immediately but now that i had paid them I had no choice but to continue. She then said she is scanning appropriate profiles but why dont I also start looking at the Freelancers who had applied. I told her, if this is what I wanted to do then I wouldn't have paid freelancers.com USD 30 to help in the recruiting! Finally she came up with ....drumrolls please...ONE freelancer. I thought I would get at least 5 to 6 names....anyway...I then asked her to recommend a few more as I needed to assess at least 3 profiles before making a decision. Furthermore, when I requested to TALK to her to explain my project requirements she decelined and said that I could TALK / SPEAK (this are her words) to the freelancers. I had made it clear to her that I needed a conversation with the freelancer before I made a decision to recruit them or make any further payments. Now, it so happens, all the freelancers I shorlisted - all have been unable to talk to me over skype as they claim it is a violation of some terms online. This is fine but my problem is why then did you not inform me of this? I specifically mentioned to Giselle the recruiter at Freelancer.com that I will need to talk to the short-listed web developers. Anyhow, Freelancers.com might have had a good idea one time of hiring recruiters to help people like me, but along the way they have totally lost it. They treat their clients like criminals who are out to rob them of their commissions.Im not saying this doesn't happen, but they should then be able to provide a phone link on their servers (which are only accessible when you award a project implying you make a payment to the freelancer) so that we can talk under their umbrella and calls can be recorded.

Or the customer is told that he will not not get the code or the documentation if he does not give a 5 star rating.  

Also If you reach freelancer for these issues they ask you to resolve these issues amongst yourself. We will not mediate is what they say.

28,"Dear readers and fellow freelancers

I was attracted by the freelancer.com reviews, most of which holding 5-star rating and nice narrations from other users (which are mostly manufactured by freelancer.com's paid review writers). at the beginning I found the site user friendly but with the course of time in the name of web development and facility enhancement for the users though the freelancer.com authority introduced some extraordinary ideas, within these they also set up the horrible plans of squeezing the users. 

the site owners only give advantage to the clients and project advertisers and never help the contractors if their money is stolen by dint of malicious practices. I was robbed of my earned project fees even though I completed all necessary precautionary steps. so it seems to me there is some sort of connection between the ill motivated contractors and the freelancer.com authority. 

since it is a virtual world and a contractor has very limited ability of raising a complain to legal authority so the freelancer.com takes this advantage. though it is their obligation to check and verify each and every contractors financial background but they don't do that as a mandatory practice. they allow everyone to launch a project in their site and those scrupulous clients get easy chance of cheating the hard earned contractors' money. whenever my money is stolen by a client the freelancer.com support team only indicated the reason as the client used an unauthorized payment source so his/her money is returned back.

what a joke, who has to check whether a client's payment source is legal or illegal, do this falls on the responsibility of a contractor??? but what happened to my sorrow in the last two years is whenever money that I received in my escrow fund and then it is again sucked out from my account and diverted to the client, the freelancer.com team just advised me to be more vigilant.

I am vigilant since the first incident of loosing money two years back occurred but I cannot control things which are under the only authority of freelancer.com team. the freelancer.com authority is straightaway linked to cyber crime, this authority must be brought under legal procedure otherwise many more innocent contractors will face financial demurrage. so it's time to raise voice against all illegal operations of freelancer.com and be alert about their dishonesty.",1,“freelancer.com a market place of systematic scamming”

- Says it's free to have an account . . . and then after you get all set up, a couple days later, notifies you that you must sign up for a paid membership to continue. Nice advertising. They ought to point that out up front.

- Takes a sizable chunk out of every transaction, whether you end up getting paid or not. (Your employer also has the liberty to cancel the project at any time, whether you've done the work or not.)

- Is filled with scammers who waste your time (at best)

- Is extremely difficult and complicated to use

- Charges you a fee to accept a job (!!!) (A $5.40 fee for a $12 job, in my case)

- Does not explain things well (I accidentally reported a perfectly innocent user because of an unclear button (typical of Freelancer) and spent a good amount of time trying to fix it, only to be brushed off by customer service after complaining that I was notified ""Action has been taken against the user you reported."" This is NOT the only time a non-explained button or process got me into trouble.)

- Lets you work really hard and finish a project and THEN notifies you that in order to get paid you must ""verify your identity"" through a complicated process wherein, among other things, you take a picture of yourself holding your drivers license and a special number they give you, plus you must provide a proof of residence (they say a utility bill or a bank statement(!)), neither of which I have since I am 18 and live with my parents. Tough luck! Long and short of it, I was not paid on my first project (which, by the way, is also my last.)

- Is full of low paying gigs that pay anywhere from $2.50-$5 per article (except for the rare high paying gig, more on those below) and these employers want you to work twelve hours per day on this laughable wage.

- Does have nice employers who post projects offering decent wages--but in order to take on these jobs, you must have a LOT of reviews (from toiling away for the slave-labor employers, of course!) AND you might even have to upgrade your membership to get the job!

- Made me get feel like I went gray overnight.

- Told me I had 107 bids I could make--and then when I'd made less than fifty, it said I'd run out and couldn't place anymore. (?)

- Is not a place where skilled, professional writers should expect to make money. Period.

The test questions are quite simple for anybody who has done English at school but I still ended up failing. The reason for failing I believe is tester gets 5 minutes to answer a ridiculous number of simple questions and it is designed so that one can't finish it in time. Basically it is designed so you retake the test and pay for it again.

Second, serious freelancers are barred from bidding on jobs over $1000.

Third, they charge you to respond to an invitation.  Making false invitations a money-maker for them.  Theoretically, you get your money back if you don't get the job, but they make it a headache.

Fourth, getting your money from them is difficult.

47,"People come here to find an income, but it is common thing to pay more that you are hoping to get.

I am a freelancer with several months experience, and using this site brought me a bit of grey hair.

Most of ""employers"" are really speculators. They pick a project for, say, 300$ and search for a starving programmer who can complete it for 30$ or even 300 INR. The worst thing is that they find such people successfully. One disappointing trait of them is awful communication. They treat your as a slave (as ""talking instrument"") and command to you in impudent tone, ignore your questions and sometimes don't bother making payments. Such people/companies hunt for higher-price project on this site too, and shamelessly put their project with the same description once awarded.

Another kind of employer is an obvious crook. They lure you into bidding and promise you a lot, but you should complete their job first (or even a ""testing task""). No need to say a scammer disappears as soon as he gets what he need.

I have to say, there are bright stars of real, first-hand, promptly-paying and well-communicating customers too. Consider yourself lucky if you find one.

In any case, the site takes its 10% fee as soon as you accept a project, no matter if you get paid or not. If the project owner is one of such crooks, you are at your own. Their support treats you as a human garbage. Don't expect even a response to your ticket after your account has been messed up by them! Generally, they turn their face to scammers and the opposite body part to honest workers.

They have a strict ""walled garden"" policy, and openly persecute people for their attempts of direct communication. Freelancers, I mean, because an employer is a person of a higher sort, and he just receives a warning. There is no way for freelancers to communicate between themselves, and we cannot warn each other about a known scammer.

It takes a lot of effort to maintain a good freelancer profile. It takes nothing for a freaky employer to leave you a worst rating for a completed and polished project. You have a finite number of available bids, and you have to pay if you need more. Any freak may just close a project you and others have bid on, and create it again hoping to get a lower quote.

I am amazed to see a zillion of positive reviews. But most of them are equally short, dumb and full of uncertain buzzwords. Seems their support is working hard to make a false positive image of this cesspool. I've ever seen the same profile images for people pretending to be different.

Their attitude takes so much of your nerves that terrible technical problems appear not so important. The site is painfully slow. Your stats become calculated wrong (as in 10 + 20 = 5). Your 5-star rating may just disappear, as do a part of your profile/reviews. The system may take a piece of your already received money just because there's a full moon.

And you are at your own, because no matter what you do the site takes profit of it. And because everyone else is your competitor.",1,"“Work for free, and even pay for that” "

Freelancer.com is ruining my life, and the lives of thousands of contractors, it's not to be trusted nor used. My review is long but worth reading and will show you how no one in their right mind, should use it. 

I've been a member in this platform for over 5 years, I'm in the top 0.5% of contractors, I have 57 reviews, and 56 of them are perfect 5 stars. I only mentioned all of this, to show you that if they're treating me this way, then imagine how they would treat other users.

I had an issue with the website a while back, which I'll spare you the details of, that lead me to escalate the matter to get it solved, which I did. Prior to that issue, the website was placing a 2 months limitation on my account which stopped me from being paid or getting work, and after I resolved that I issue, I must have stepped on a few toes, because the day after, my account was placed under limitation once again. I contacted the website asking for an explanation, and the support agent rudely told me to stop asking questions and do my work, and they'll remove it when they feel like it. They didn't use these words, but it was the gest of it. I'm a proud person, and would never beg nor plead but i was put in a corner. A few months back my father passed away, and just a couple weeks later, i was in a bad car accident which left me in a bad shape and had to use all my savings to pay my medical bills. Right after that, the account was limited for two months as i mentioned earlier and i was barely getting by. But once the issue was resolved and the new ""open limitation"" was placed, i was desperate and strapped for cash. I had $3600 in my account which freelancer refused to allow me to withdraw, and at the same time I had bills piling up, so I contacted them appealing to their humanity and explaining that I did absolutely nothing wrong to deserve such treatment. I'm a well-respected person in my industry yet I was being treated like a criminal. It became clear later on that this limitation was placed by a support agent which I apparently angered during the first issue, and that the website had no basis nor reason to limit me. The first time I asked for the reason I was told that there's no reason and that I should keep working, then I was told that because a client complained, and in another occasion, i was told something else that I can't quite remember. At the end, they stopped making excuses and told me that the limitation will be lifted on the 4 of November, the date in which I'm writing this review. And I was told so on 5 separate occasions which I luckily have documented and asked for the Chat ID's (which is something you should always do when dealing with freelancer). A one-month limitation was hard and I didn't know if I can make it, but I basically had no choice, and they knew it. But a few days after this, the support agent that has something against me contacted me letting me know that she will only remove my limitation once I finish all my open projects, i tried to explain to her that this can't be, and that as a contractor I have no authority over clients to close projects, they can take forever with edits and improvements and new features, or just leave or any other scenario which I have no control over. I explained that my work is my life, that I will finish my work regardless because I have a responsibility toward my clients, and that how do they expect me to survive until then if my account is limited and I don't even have access to my money. And over our conversation that lasted a few weeks, i kept contacting freelancer and asking about the limitation and all the support agents assured me that it will be removed on the 4th, but she insisted that it won't, and apparently she won, because today I woke up, and indeed the limitation is still here.
A support agent, that had something against me is ruining my life, is pushing me to depression and shortly homelessness. Last year around this time i was a successful business owner, and due to a series of misfortunate events, I have been reduced to this. Being treated like a thief or something, and constantly being threatened and told that my account can be suspended and deleted at any time. 
I gave 5 years to freelancer, I wholeheartedly trusted them, and one of their support agents basically ruined my life because I stepped on her toes. I'm at a loss for words, I don't know how I should feel, what I should do, the only clear thought in my mind is that I should warn people about this platform and tell them to stay the hell away. Whether you're a contractor or an employer, they will screw you mercilessly and you won't have a leg to stand on. If they did all of this to me, imagine what they would do to you... 

PS: I heard of many cases where users had their accounts suspended after complaining about this platform. I realize the risk, and I'm taking it for you good people, so you know who you're dealing. And if my account does get suspended, I'll update my review and let you know.",1,“DO NOT USE THIS PLATFORM! STAY AWAY! MY REVIEW IS LONG BUT WORTH READING. CONSIDER IT A WARNING.”

Bad sign right there - most legit sites will ask your permission before taking money. Have to go through their support services every time to get incorrect, unauthorised payments refunded. They dont refund to PayPal. They put it in your account forcing you to go through the slow manual transfer to your own account process.
2 - Their exams are out of date. Asking questions that are no longer true for modern versions of software. Their basic exams ask trick questions on arcane topics that dont prove a good coder - just someone who has read the cheat sheets.
3 - Support sucks. Slow reposnses - 3 - 5 minutes aprt normally. multi tasking with other clients at the same time. rude nad a wste of time.
4 - Spammy bids - sooo many spammybids nad no way to ban, block or report them.
5 - New algorithms for coders to show how good their bids are - but no way to see why you have a bad or good score. they claim project posters make up alot of the report on bid quality - but yet there is no place for project posters to feed back on $#*!ty bids - and there are heaps of them.
6 - A a coder - getting work is a dive to the lowest price, hitting as many projects as possible and getting advertised to to pay more money to get yourself chosen or at the top of the list. 
7 - Services like a project concierge - will take your money and choose coders without the relevant skill sets - then claim they have done their jobs. 
8 - Half the functionality is broken. Try clicking alink to get to the exams page - there isn't one easily findable. try to see what level of subscription you have - it takes you to a hey upgrade and pay more page.

Horror Story
This is absolutely the worst experience of any company in general that I ever had.

I pay for the premium freelance service - 60 a month, to place unlimited bids.

Out of nowhere, I receive an infraction claiming that it's because of the bids I'm making. Even though I literally pay for unlimited bids.

Once the 24-hour infraction is lifted, I go back to bidding, obviously with more care this time, and elaborating further, to prove that I am a legit freelancer, and not spamming.

Lo and behold, the mobile app will not let me bid, and claims that my app is restricted.

For two whole days, support doesn't understand the problem...literally not reading my messages then replying ""ah, sorry, I answered my own question"" (I can provide screenshots)...because they are claiming it is ""general issues"". But I can bid from my laptop...and my mobile app is saying my account is restricted. A 3 year-old can determine that it is not ""general issues"".

So now, unable to bid on the mobile app - I receive an infraction, this time they claim I posted my email address.

The only time I posted my e-mail address is to clarify a dispute that my employer made for $111 after she released a milestone. Freelancer immediately froze me out of the money for the dispute, putting my account in the negative...which led to me bidding to more projects, which caused this whole chain reaction.

So now, I have two infractions I shouldn't, and I am out $111....all while paying $60 a month for their supposed premium service.

Contact me at @transcribing247 and I can recommend plenty of services other than freelancer.com. They will take your money, and then they will play dumb, as if they don't understand, when it comes to support.

The support is literally so dense that I had to point out that one employer was trying to commit felony forgery by asking for my driver's license with responses like ""Maybe they just want to know where you are from""

Another time I told them about a racist message and they suggested that I ""not take it seriously"".

This company is absolutely insane.

I wouldn't recommend this company if they gave you a free membership.

I didn't get the message to pay US$6 to carry on with arbitration, if I did receive the message I would pay and I knew the dispute will be in my favour, the freelancer wasn't doing the job requested, he copied the website and asked to shift the webhost, instead of fix the bug from existing webhost.

107,"Though I had been working both as freelancer and employer for the freelancer.com site and I have done many successful projects in both profile,
recently my posted projects are getting fewer and fewer proposals as i myself realized i also hardly bid on projects due to their introduced repressive feature 'bid quality score' which has hardly any legit reason for determining the bid quality.
I Myself take my bids on projects seriously and complete as much of the information that I understand. If nothing, I know my skills, and I don't apply for anything I am not qualified for and many employers send me messages after i place a bid for discussion on the project, but they keep on lowering my bid quality score- may be they want me to  spend money to sponsor the bid or something.
And for my posted projects  too i can clearly see the response is getting crappier as i always welcome new comer freelancer to join a project if he/she has the skill. But after introducing this feature less freelancer are bidding and i am having to search for a suitable candidate for my project outside freelancer site. 
If this is a business strategy which is causing harassment for both freelancers  and employers by the freelancer.com site then this is really disappointing and sad.

108,"If you check all the reviews before July, 2017 then you will find out real review from real clients. All the reviews that you see with 5 rating in a long series then be 100% that these are fabricated reviews added to sitejabber.com by its team. Freelancer.com has a team of content writers whose reposibilities are to produce fake and false postings whether it is be the projects listed on freelancer.com or 5 rating reviews on sitejabber.com or posting good image of their business on facebook page of freelancer.com, etc. Freelancer.com uses these content writers to do all the fake postings and this is why number of projects that you see posted on freelancer.com with ambiguous or very short or funny project descriptions are also posted by the same content writers team in order to trap sellers and buyers both.

The world of freelancing.com was much better before this fraud and cheating world of freelancer.com acquired all the other good, honest and reputable freelancing sites like getafreelancer.com, vworker.com, limeexchange.com, etc. Matt Berrie's Freelancer.com has turned this whole freelacing industry into a complete fraud and scam due to one man's OWN greed, lack of vision, treating employers and potential service providers as his money making slave machines. Certainly freelancing business on the above mentioned marketplaces platforms was the reason of millions of families to earn their bread and butter which this goon, cheat, dishonest, thug, low character and low esteem guy has turned into a money snatch platform for buyers through imposing unjustified fees and made it slavery for employees who will always be doubtful  whether they will get paid for all the hardwork they did or the money their client has released to give to them. Freelancer.com is doing fraud both way. It make unjustified transactions on employers card and try every possible way to find reasons of not paying hard earned money which a service provider has earned from his/her client.

We wish and hope for a new platform to come and emerge on the model of vworker.com or getafreelancer.com so that we all good freelancers abandon this titanic who is continuously sinking from past 4 years every since Matt Barrie and his characterless and useless team is deployed to manage it all. Freelancer.coms acquiring of vworker.com, scriptlance.com, getafreelancer.com and limeexchange platform has caused us a waste of 15 years of time, efforts and life spent in this industry and business.

The best revenge is to abandon and boycott the site and create a lack of good sellers or service providers which were ultimately result into lack of interest for the buyers to even think of this platform for quality and 100% successful project. 

Also if we do forensic audit of the database of sellers on the site then I am sure that more than 80% are student sellers as most good sellers have already left the place and moved to other platforms like upwork.com or new emerging freelancing sites, etc.

But talk to many freelancers who have used the site and a very different picture begins to emerge. 

A cursory look at independent consumer review sites reveals an abnormally high volume of complaints about fraudulent activity conducted via the site and a lack of support when users get caught out.

On the popular consumer review site, Sitejabber, Freelancer garnered only 1 and a half stars from almost 1000 reviews. 

In the last month alone, 34 one-star reviews have been posted, with comments that make for sobering reading. 

Freelancer took my money Moris N. Please sign the petition to save others Scam
Its a similar story at Reviewopedia and highya, where Freelancer has garnered only 1 star from 127 reviews and 1 and a half stars from 131 reviews, respectively.

At Trustpilot, freelancer.com received a Bad rating (2 out of 10) following 142 reviews.

Complaints board  an independent consumer news and database of rated complaints submitted by users is also littered with Freelancer.com grievances and details of scams being run via the site.

These claims arent new to Freelancer and the company has attempted to deflect attention from security issues in the past.

In March 2013, the Company placed a link its Facebook page entitled, Don't believe everything you read on the Internet: Lies, Scams and Freelancer.com  the link now returns to the homepage, with the article apparently deleted.

It is not difficult to find numerous articles, dedicated websites and even a change.org petition criticising the site or calling for action.

Why all the smoke, if there is no fire?

Stopping short of admitting a problem but seemingly aware, the company this year announced on its website that it was taking steps in its fight against fraud.

Were serious about protecting all of our users from fraudulent transactions, and we are constantly working to ensure our site remains the safest and most secure place to hire or find work.

Today were introducing a new weapon in our fight against fraud - the security period. Effective January 18, 2016, a small number of transactions will be locked for a security period of between 7 and 15 days.

Special Investigation:

Having briefly trialled the site following its debut on the ASX, I completed a couple of projects and developed a 4 and a half star rating before encountering fraudulent users.

I decided to return to see if the companys new security measures had provided improved protection for freelancers. 

I paid to complete some site-based exams to improve my profile, uploaded my portfolio and set about bidding on jobs. 

Before long, I received a system-generated email: Congratulations Nick Ashdown saw your profile and wants to hire you directly! 

Ready to start work? Don't wait too long, accept before Nick Ashdown offers it to someone else! 

The email link took me to a job listing where I had previously placed a bid. A chat window was already open and Nick greeted me in second-language level English. 

Nick was a clean-cut male in the photo (a small flag indicated he was currently based in the UK), with a credible profile blurb about being a graphic designer.

English wasnt his first language (he said he was European) and he needed someone to professionally edit a technical document in English.

His account was indicated with a large green-lit tick, directly underneath the employers details with the words verified. Hovering a cursor over the symbol indicated that the user had made a financial deposit.

To a new freelancer, the listing provided scant warning to suggest that the employer had not been in some way secured.

Only that he was new to the site, with a high-value project and no reviews, which is far from unusual the site.

For all intensive purposes his biography, photo and the project itself, looked genuine. He was verified financially by email and phone. Only under closer inspection (hovering a mouse over a small icon) does it inform that the employer has not completed profile 100%. 

To the uninitiated however, the general impression is certainly one of some kind of security.

Milestones

Within its FAQs, the company recommends Freelancers request a milestone payment before doing any work. Only the employer can create a milestone payment and make the release. 

Requesting a milestone would certainly limit the possibility of being defrauded but for many new freelancers, it also limits the possibility of being hired. 

Many employers are understandably wary of working with freelancers with no record. Lacking a developed profile with ratings and reviews, new freelancers are at an immediate disadvantage. 

They are also more likely to forgo requesting a milestone payment upfront out of fear they will miss out on the work.

Anyone arriving at a job advertisement from a system-generated email will also be encouraged to accept quickly, to not miss out, and the default milestone is set at no milestone (100%).

Verified Nick Disappears

Nick and I began a discussion and agreed to a rate of $200 for editing the technical 2000 word article. 

I decided to proceed by accepting the project and after completing it, sent it to Nick in the chat window who gratefully received it and told me he would check it and get back to me shortly. 

That was the last I heard from him.

I returned a few hours later to find the project had been cancelled and deleted from my work history.

A message on my timeline simply read: Your project has been deleted by your employer Nick Ashdown. This project can no longer be accessed or showcased, but your feedback can still be viewed from your profile.

What happened to my work is anyones guess. It was possibly submitted to a genuine employer on Freelancer.com or elsewhere and likely passed off as the work of whoever Nick Ashton was.

Seemingly $200 out of pocket, I contacted Freelancers Live Chat to see what options the company presented to me.  

As the employer had the green verified tick and other verifications, I assumed there would be some course of action I could take.

GF: We have deleted the accounts and the project due to their issue, Gary F told me. 

GF: They have violated our Terms and Conditions. Thus, we have closed their account. 

Me: But the account was verified. And the work I submitted?

GF: We can no longer return the payment.

Me: Well can I speak with a manager?

GF: We do not have any manager (sic) available. 

Not exactly going the extra mile, but Live Chats Gary F was quite right. 

Once the company deems a user has violated the company's Terms and Conditions, the user's account can by closed at any time. 

Scant comfort for a new freelancer, who is encouraged to bid on expensive project, have it accepted and a fee deducted, only for it to be deleted without warning, leaving the freelancer out of pocket.

Only Freelancer.com will not be out of pocket it seems.

Project Fees

Freelancer.coms project fees are taken irrespective of any accepted project, verified or not, real or not, deleted or not.

Freelancer.com clearly states, for fixed price projects, if you are awarded a project, and you accept, we charge you a small project fee relative to the value of the selected bid, as an introduction fee. 

The fee for fixed price projects is 10% or $5.50 AUD, whichever is greater, and 10% for hourly projects.

When Nick awarded me the project and I accepted, I was automatically charged the introduction fee and it wasnt returned when Nick Ashdowns profile and project were abruptly deleted for violating the companys terms and conditions.

The fee was also deducted despite having no money in my Freelancer account - my account was now sitting at -$22.  

I contacted Live Chat once again where Jeri F confirmed my suspicions. 

The project fee is generally non-refundable because it serves as an introduction fee to freelancers and employers for using our site's services.

Expressing dismay that I could be charged a fee from a fraudulent listing on their site, she eventually offered to forward a refund request for the project fee for that project. 

I have since been refunded for the fee on that transaction, but Nick and the $200, have gone forever. 

It is clear that in the event of a freelancer accepting a project from a fraudulent employer, the onus is on the freelancer to identify the fee and chase up the company for its return. 

This is despite potentially being already out of pocket from a fraudulent user, who was free to post a credible looking job listing and profile on the site.

Unverified

I later bid on a high-value project, this time from an unverified employer requesting a ghostwriter. 

He awarded me the project and engaged me in discussing details. I accepted (was charged the project fee) and he then tried luring me to Skype - something Freelancer.com quite rightly doesnt recommend. 

When questioned, he disappeared, leaving the project open. The project fee for the unverified project remained debited from my account and my balance is now sitting at -$91.

It is questionable as to why you would even allow unverified employers to list on the site in the first place? It makes for a dangerous place for a new freelancer to try and ply their trade and build a name. 

A look through the projects listed on Freelancer.com, reveals a large number of new, unverified and partially verified employers with high budget projects.

The higher the budget, the higher the commission freelancer.com receives when an awarded project is accepted. The fee structure also sees the Company benefit from the highest volume possible of projects being accepted.

If the Company draws revenue from any awarded project being accepted, it begs the question of how serious the company is, about purging suspect projects, before they are accepted.

After all, the company does boast to being the largest of its type  by total number of users and projects posted. 

Nothing to See Here

Freelancer.com is a site where many legitimate employers and freelancers from all over the world meet and successfully do business. 

During my months on the site, I successfully completed a few projects and had some good experiences with genuine employers. 

However, in over 20 interactions, I encountered nearly as many suspect or clearly fraudulent users, as I did genuine ones. I also had three projects abruptly and belatedly cancelled, after I had accepted the awarded projects.

Freelancer.com may well be the worlds largest freelancing and crowdsourcing marketplace by total number of users and projects posted. But how many of those are genuine is open for debate. 

If only a small proportion of users are not genuine, it calls into question the Companys numbers when claiming to connect over 16,183,045 employers and freelancers globally.

On the site, the company also declares it is a community that values your trust and safety as our number one priority.

If that were true, wouldnt the company automatically refund the project fee they deducted from the freelancer, when they belatedly delete an in-progress project from a fraudulent user?

Leaving a potentially defrauded freelancer to chase after a project fee, from a project that shouldnt have been listed in the first place, does not sound like a number one priority. 

What is clear is that any freelancers considering using the site, need to be very careful and do extensive research before or posting a project.

Freelancer.com CEO, Matt Barrie could not be reached to comment on this story. The Companys head office phone number is not listed on the site or on his personal website.

I did, however, receive a response from Freelancer.com support, with the company continuing to deny there is a major security issue.

We keep our site safe for both freelancers and employers. We have security measures to ensure that only quality bidders can employers can transact on our site. 

We expect our user's capability to discern every participation, negotiation, and any agreement they will enter into one other.

Once again, the onus is on the freelancer to protect themselves and clean up the site by reporting any violation not that it will do the Freelancer any good in recouping work already lost.

Last month, Freelancer.com announced it added two more Webby Awards to its name, now having a total of 10 in five short years.

We are redefining employment with the Internet, creating a secure marketplace that empowers employers and freelancers from around the world by helping them connect with each other, Matt Barrie, Chief Executive of Freelancer.com said in the statement.

But if you ask many freelancers who have used the site, Freelancer.com is anything but secure and could do with living up to its claims.

I did a project with an Employer (client name is hidden due to privacy agreement) on a project. She released a payment for the project. We delivered them the project and after sometimes, it was observed that payments in my account are locked total of $2400. I received an Email from Freelancer that it will be unlocked if dispute is resolved in your favor.

I kept following up with their support and they said that we are waiting for employer to resolve matter with their account. After some days I received email from employer stating that dispute is done in Freelancer.com favor and she didn't want to contact me or Freelancer anymore because she said I am done. Now where is that MONEY ? In Freelancer.com SCAM BOX ?

This is not the first time. If employer make a charge back, and freelancer does the dispute and inform their freelancer only once that dispute is being handled. But later we never know even if dispute is won in Freelancer.com favor they never inform you and keep that amount with them. This is their best strategy to screw the users and they talk about Terms and Conditions. Unfair ways.

As it turns out, they are withdrawing money from my bank account without me knowing about it and obviously, without me agreeing to it. 
They are not handling the refunds well. I am fighting to get my money back and once I succeed I will delete my account forever. This couldn't be worst!",1,“They were taking money from my bank account !!!!!” 
139,"What is going on with Freelancer? It really seems the longer I am with this site the harder it becomes for me to find work. I'll elaborate.

1) My biggest issue recently; the new bid proposal system. Literally this system is the worst change I have seen to Freelancer since I have been with the site. Why is it I am only allowed to type about 2 sentences for my proposal for complex projects like webscraping where every site and the challenges it presents are different?

It is becoming literally impossible for me to stand out from anyone else because all I can put is ""I am an expert in webscraping blah blah"". I can't elaborate on how I would accomplish the project or tackle its challenges or why my work would be superior/unique. Please for the love of god revert this system.

2) The changes to chat have the made the site a LOT slower. Everytime I load up a page it reloads all my chats and the javascript takes forever to complete in addition to the actual chat boxes lagging when I try to type. This makes it take longer for me to scan the site for projects and place bids and reduces my overall efficiency.

3) The new bid sponsor system is terrible and I never use it because now it costs me $30 to sponsor a bid when it used to cost a few dollars. This is money I DO NOT get back if I am not awarded the project so why would I risk 10% or more of the actual project payout in an attempt to stand out.

4) Why am I charged when I deposit funds into my Freelancer account when I am also charged a high % on milestones I am paid?

Honestly I don't know if its greed or a need to change for the sake of change but so much of what has been done in the past year has hindered my success as a Freelancer with the site rather than help it.

I am thankful for the Preferred Freelancer program but everything else that has been done is awful and might look nice on the surface but does not help the actual Freelancer at all which is surprising considering the sites name.

One simple change I can think of that would be amazing is let Preferred Freelancers initiate chats with employers. None of us are going to spam the employer we would simply say ""Hello I am X and I am very interested in your project. Here is how I would complete it to your satisfaction, etc"".

Furthermore, my client's account was blocked and I can't contact him. I asked FL to give me his contact details, but did not have any support.
At the end of the day, FL charged me all the losses associated with this fraud. I was completely dissatisfied with this approach, as a top-rated reputable freelancer here...

This won't happen at all. Now I am only using paypal resolution center to communicate with them. I can see that they don't give a damn about paypal (they never post messages there), but I am taking this very seriously.

I have worked with freelancer.com for 7years. Seven good years of my life went down with this company. 

Before then, I signed up with script lance site which later sold to them my info was transferred to freelancer.com by chance( I didn't just find myself there intentionally considering the circumstance)
The first few months, I discovered their non-refundable commission policy which they use to scam both buyers and workers. They can collect lots of money from your account without explanations. after a task is done, they will still collect money and when an employer files a chargeback from the bank, they won't investigate the issue but claims 50% of the charge & give the employer 50% whereby encouraging work without pay while they accomplice the employer to steal from you. Most case, if you get a new employer who didn't know anything about freelancer.com tricks and weakness, you will get paid but once you meet their partners in crime, you're screwed for good. A lot of stuffs are going on there that I wonder why the crime investigation team on the Internet haven't shutdown that site.

The latest scam plot between freelancer and the employers is to claim that milestone is released to you while the employer file for a chargeback from the bank and recieve a total refund and you lose your file to them. 

I have struggled with this issue for months now and an employer I worked for 4months ago with good review given to me, didn't file a chargeback but there is an issue of chargeback filed by freelancer on behalf of the employer. How did I find out, I talked with the employer and he told me clearly that he didn't have any issues with me. Infact he still appreciates the task I did for him. I asked him to contact freelancer.com and he did but they asked him to provide vital government based info with other credit card details and he sensed the fradulent plan and refused. The employer replied to me with this comment
""That site is evil""
he encouraged me to use other platform but I wanted to get to the root of the matter by contacting freelancer.com customer service who claimed that the employer refused to further verify his identity. I asked them what that has to do with the chargeback claims (because it's obvious the employer didn't file dispute and the task I did 4months ago. Till now this people haven't replied, they took 350 Australian dollars from my account and refuse to give me back my money.

they wont give me my money that i worked for in a valid contest. they have to give me 166GBP. but they are scam, they told me that the contest was closed to protect me as a user. this has no relevance or logic..

short story: i have entered in a contest, with prize 500GBP to create design for an employer. the contest was GUARANTEED (this is a safety measure to guarantee us the freelancers that the money will be paid to us, for sure, meaning the prize wil be awarded 100% even if the employer does not decide a winning design). i have uploaded many valid entries, me and other freelancers. the contest holder (employer) had 14days to decide the winning design, but unfortunately he did not pick one. so the prize must be splitted between the active entries. meaning me and 2 other freelancers had active entries for the contest. i have talked with one of the support team and assured me that the money will be splitted in 3, after another 14 days. it has been passed these 14 days, and yesterday when i wait my part of the share 166.66GBP, i see the contest deleted and no money in the account.

their explanation: We understand your concern on this contest. However, it is better to remove the contest that will cause liabilities to users and to us even if the contest is Guaranteed. We are protecting users from this kind of contest as it will create issues in the future.

199,"A PURE SCAM SITE - WAVE YOUR MONEY GOODBYE

I have been hiring freelancers for at least 5 years now. I have tried and used all the websites out there which provide services of this kind. But let me tell you what I have experienced at Freelancer.com

2 weeks ago I posted a job on Freelancer.com. I then uploaded money to Freelancer.com, in order to pay one freelancer for a completed translation job. However, Freelancer.com DID NOT pay out the money to my freelancer. No - what they did, was to follow their usual routine of trying all the tricks in the book, in order to hold the money on their account. My freelancer had to face a myriad of various verifications, unreasonable and even ridiculous requests and requirements - but even though she complied with them all, money WERE NOT PAID OUT, till this very day. My freelancer finally wrote to me, that she had lost any hope to get the money from Freelancer, and that she will rather let Freelancer keep the money. However, I have conscience, and cannot let someone do the job without getting paid - so I encouraged her not to give up, and now took the matter into my own hands.

I submitted a support ticket, in which I clearly demanded Freelance.com to either pay my money to my freelancer, or to return the money to my credit card. 2 business days have past since then - no answer whatsoever - a complete silence.

What I can tell with 100% certainty, is that Freelancer.com staff has a very clear set of instructions, set up and given to them by the very top-leadership of the company. Since the majority of freelancers come from the 3rd world countries such as India and Pakistan, Indonesia etc., this scam site Freelancer.com knows that an average person from these countries, with poor English skills and zero knowledge of relevant laws, has no chance to fight back and force Freelancer.com to pay out the money. So what Freelancer.com does - they gladly allow freelancers to sign-up and immediately participate and place bid on the projects. They also gladly accept money from the hiring parties, such as me - no verification needed. Just send the money, man! But once the money are uploaded to their account - oh boy - that's when the party starts. Suddenly they become very concerned with security (allegedly - your own security!) and now need to ""verify"" both the freelancer and the hiring agent. Again - they didn't need any verifications in order to accept your money.

So - after they receive your money, they immediately create a ""Wall of Verification"". First they demand an ID copy (which, by the way, is illegal under both Australian law, and law of the most countries - private companies HAVE NO LEGAL RIGHT to demand copies of one's ID, as long the customer does not ask for services or products in credit). Now, if a freelancer from Pakistan or India complies with the illegal demand, and indeed sends their ID copy, Freelancer.com starts to demand for an ID in English letters - despite having the many years practice, and despite already knowing very well that IDs from these countries are only issued in native script. Then they ask for bank statements, and if a freelancer has no bank account (for example, a teenager or a woman from Asian countries) - sorry, we can't give you your money. Then, if by a miracle a freelancer somehow manages to satisfy all they demands, Freelancer.com then starts from the other end - starts ""verifying"" the hiring agent. Now, if the hiring agent has some understanding of the relevant laws, and refuses to send any sensitive IDs - they will simply keep the money.

Like I said - all of this is done deliberately, hoping that freelancers, especially those from 3rd world countries, after many unsuccessful attempts will finally lose patience and hope, and give up on their money held by Freelancer.com. Because, as in my case, if the payment is around 250, then the chances are slim that the average freelancer will ever get enough projects to generate the same amount in form of fees. And even if Freelancer.com is finally forced to pay out the money ( I guess 1 out 20 Asians probably manage achieve this), most often Freelancer.com will have kept the money for significant amounts of time, without paying the money owner any interest. In practice, this means that they daily get massive free loans, which, very often, are not even paid back. I assume, this startegy alone generates around 50% of Freelancer.com revenue.

So now, as of today, Freelancer.com official excuse to hold my freelancer's money, is that they are ""reviewing"" my - the hiring agent's account. They asked me to send them a copy of my ID - something that no private company can demand. Of course, I am not going to send any copies of my IDs or other sensitive douments, because of 2 reasons:
1. such request is simply illegal - IDs are highly sensitive personal documents, and only official state institutions can demand for it - not private companies as this one.
2. at least ninety percent (90%) of Freelancer.com customer support are outsourced to namely India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, etc. This means that their customer support is based in these countries. Any documents that you upload to Freelancer.com, can be accessed with one click by hundreds of 3rd world nationals, who can (and will) easily abuse and forge your ID and use it for financial crimes or terrorism.

Like I said, I have been hiring freelancers for many years, and I know these tactics in and out. However, I must say that Freelancer.com scores highest, as the most fraudulent site of them all. I am going to draw their criminal practices into the daylight. If you are a freelancer or a hiring party, remember, that I and my freelancer are not the only people whose money have been literraly stolen - Google up ""freelancer.com scam"" and read about them in Wikipedia. A pure scam site.

I pressed the link in the email that said 'view and accept your project' thinking it would take me to a page that I could accept or reject but in reality kt automatically accepted the project. This left me with a dummy project and a $25 charge on my account. The customer service rep was nice enough, she seemed to misunderstand me a bunch but after some time I got her to withdraw the charge. 

I immediately closed my account. It's basically a site full of scammers run by people who are not fluent in English. They make bank on the non-refundable charges and do not care if the account that offered was closed before the offer was accepted.  (if my accepting had not been an accident she would have left the charge)

The problem is that you find these so called companies over in India that uses different names, different profiles, fake samples of their work. along with fake reviews to lure you in.  Everything was going great during the milestone, the person I connected with via Skype seemed to understand every aspect and functionality that I needed to design my web page. My project was broken down into 5 milestones, and somewhere along the 3rd milestone is where everything went south.  All of a sudden the person that I had been communicating with for months sounded different, and I kept repeating myself consistently when he had understood exactly what I wanted during the initial phases of the project.  My gut was telling me that I was now dealing with a different person because this one had terrible English over the phone, and the tone and grammar in his emails were totally different. Unbeknownst to me, they had sold my project to another company and their job was to pick up where the other goon had left off. It was a complete disaster, but because I had already invested over 3k in the initial milestones I was at the point of no return.  I had no choice but to move forward with the project, I saw my hopes and dreams of this fabulous website disappearing before my eyes, they barely understood what I wanted, and the design was poorly done the functionality had all kinds of bugs in it, they would lie and tell me that they fixed it, only to go in and it had not been corrected. They barely had any design or coding skills, and I am quite sure the first dude sold this project to them for pennies. I had to go along with whatever they could do.  Here is where the extortion comes in, a few days before the project was wrapping up, they reached out to me and said that if I want them to maintain my website and since they are familiar with the coding and design, it would be better for me to use them for this service. Then they added if I want their developer to continue to do a good job on the final phase, that I need to go out and give them a five-star review.  Again, out of fear that they would put a bug in the final phase of the project, I reluctantly gave them a 5 star review, when they deserved zero stars.  My website has so many glitches and bugs that it's just a sitting duck.  I will never use Freelancer, as this is just a way to hustle Americans out of their hard-earned cash.

So I hopped over to the customer help immediately and did manage to speak to a rep, when I explained that there had been no confirmation and I hadnt used any features she then printed out a list of the T&C's that I had signed when I registered, I kept at her, saying that I had only been registered for one day, with 30 days left on my trial why would I choose to pay for it. Eventually she managed to process a refund for me, great I thought - not too painful as I left the chat.

Except the refund she gave me was in their site credit. So with £40 in credit, I thought the easiest way around their pesky system would be to withdraw it like you would do with your earnings - nope. The withdraw system apparently doesnt work for ""deposits"".

248,"I needed news articles written in native Portuguese so I accepted the offer to do the job from a freelancer that was marked as ""recommended"". That's when hell began. I sent her three precise subjects and she told me she would ""scan my website"" to see the content. After some hours, she submitted articles subjects that had nothing to do with what I asked. I opened a dispute to get a refund, but then she came back with subjects that looked more or less ok. I waited for 1 day, and then got the articles... Oh my! First of all, the articles were written in gibberish English (obviously some automated translation). She said if I was happy she would then ""have them translated into Portuguese (another automated translation I guess). Also, the info on the news was outdated. I had no choice but to tell her she had to cancel the obligatory milestone payment I made or else I would open a dispute. Luckily she agreed, but her condition was that I didn't leave a bad review on her profile. Of course, during the process, Freelancer.com took fees in every step of this horror (they even take a fee when you cancel a project due to falling for their trap). And to add insult to the injury, I now have to wait 15 days to get my funds back on my PayPal account. So to sum it up: completely unprofessional service, completely inaccurate ratings of freelancers who are mostly dishonest people who hold your milestone payment hostage until you promise them not to give a bad review and the Freelancer.com thieves filling their pockets with fees taken on unsuspecting employers.Never again!",1,"“Terrible experience with Freelancer, never again!” "
249,"Hi everybody,

I have been working in freelancer.com for more than 6 years now. 

I'm one of the most reviewed freelancers in the translation field, so I would actually love that freelancer.com would treat their users honestly and would not cheat them, because I got a lot projects from this site, and they are playing all the cards to make people stop using it which would damange my company profits.

I will tell you about my last experience:

I accepted a project for a new client, for a total of 600$. 
Before accepting the project, I always require the client to create the full milestone payment in order to have a payment guarantee. (For the people who does not know what a milestone is: a milestone payment is a payment that is frozen in the project and taken from the client's account, and once the project is completed the client click on ""release"" button and then it arrives to the freelancer's account. This way both parties are some kind ""assured"".)

The client created the milestone so I accepted the project. After accepting the project freelancer.com takes his fee (5%) so they took their 30$. 
I started working on the project for many days and then I delivered it to the client. The client, quickly replied me that everything was okay with the translation and that he would release the payment. Then, after few minutes, the client came back again to me and said that freelancer.com did not allow him to release the milestone because his account was under verification revision. 
This is the first big incompetent thing of the site - why do freelancer.com allow a client to create project, and a milestone payment and start hiring for services when he/she even have not been verified? The answer is simple, because they want to to steal your fee.

I told the client not to worry, that we would wait. Then we waited 2 weeks and freelancer.com did not approve the verification of his account. Then the client decided that he would cancel his account and he would pay me by Paypal if freelancer.com did not solve the issue. I warned him that it was against the Terms and Conditions of freelancer.com and that they could suspend our accounts. He decided to open a dispute with his payment method supplier against freelancer.com and to cancel the project. He cancelled the project and my milestone payment dissapeard, without me being notified about it by freelancer.com nor even being able to dispute this milestone. This is the second big incompetent way of working of freelancer.com. Why do they offer a milestone payment service if later, the client can just cancel the project (after you have delivered your work) and run away with your money? This is just unbelievable and against any kind of protection policy for their users. 
Thanks God the client was a good person and he did not want to cheat me and said that I should not worry because he would pay me once the verification process was over.
I calmed down a little bit because my 600$ were not totally lost... but then I remembered about the 30$ fee that freelancer had charged me. I checked my transaction history and show that they had not refunded it, therefore I contacted them via chat. I explained them the situation and told them that they should give the fee back to my account, because the project had been cancelled and I had not yet being paid a dollar from that project. Then, their reply was the cleverest thing I have ever heard. They just said me that their Terms and Conditions said the project fees are not refunded. I started wondering if I was speaking with a robot... ""Yes, but the project is cancelled, no earning made through it, why should I pay for a project where I have not made any profit?"".  And the reply was: ""Note that our Terms and Conditions are to be met. For next time, you should explore your options before accepting a project"".... Worst customer service ever! How can you treat like that to a client? So you're telling me that you're cheating without even trying to hide it?

So they don't protect their freelancers and allow that a client can cancel a project and a payment whenever he wants, and moreover they don't fund back the fees to the freelancer from projects that have been cancelled by the client. So if you're a freelancer you are double $#*!*d, the client goes away without paying you and freelancer charges you his marvelous fee!

I feel really dissapointed with them, actually cheated. They should respect their users and most important, they should respect their freelancer's work and efforts. They should keep in mind that the slavery period hopeful ended and that we work for money and that our time is valious.",1,"“They just want to charge their fee, no matter if it means to steal it” "

Them stealing 500 USD from me(the story is too long to be written down here) is not everything:

They draw small amounts of money from my bank-account all the time and I never get an explenation to why they do this. I even removed my credit-card from my freelancer.com account but they keep draw these amounts!

They take fees for EVERYTHING. If you do a deposit with money to your freelancer-account, they will make a big fee out from it. They will even give you a fee for the currency exchange that takes place for EVERYTIME you either do a deposit or a withdrawal and the currency exchange fees is more than double the currency exchange fees you have at example your bank.
If you make dispute for a project, they will make a fee out of it.
If your employer doesnt answer you, you HAVE to cancel the project and guess what, if you close a project they will take a fee from it.

EVERYTHING with freelancer.com is a fraud and everything they are doing is criminal. Until the AFP does something about freelancer.com , STAY AWAY from it.",1,“stay away from freelancer.com”

It's absolutely criminal how they conduct business. You would think its 2017, it's a website; it's easy, current in supply & demand. 

But if you delete your post, Ahhh a fee is debited from any account you have linked. Do they tell you that? Does the site make that known in any way? Nope!!

How about awarding a project to a freelancer; pressing that button will result in a shock that comes when you have no idea it's coming. You'd think the system would simply say, project cost determined ""X"", fee associated ""X""!! Oh no, it doesn't. 

Not an email, message, advisement or communication prior to the debit. I get fees. I get costs. What I don't get is a company that would take money with no fair warning. 

You just get the surprise of a lifetime by the scam of the platform sending you an email saying these funds have been debited. Not a detailed description or warning or clarification what so ever. 

And if you get this radical surprise and you are in a panic, feel cheated and want to talk to a customer service person, any person who can possibly explain why this isn't communicated, why it isn't clear so you can feel confident about working with a completely virtual process, you get an equally as frustrating run around.

FAKE PROJECT JOB POST:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLJ0KeHkPoc
Freelancer.com office guys post this job offer and act as a registered real employer:
https://www.freelancer.com/projects/C-Programming/Delphi-USB-fingerprint-scanner-demo/

I found out that is fake from this website:
http://www.codenewsfast.com/cnf/article/1836464827/permalink.art-ng1867q253

They copied it, and it was 6 years ago. 29-Mar-2011

I have doubts that only freelancer.com office guys make job offering post so that there website seems busy which is fake and if they are then they would appear in top 100 busiest website.

I also made a lot of research about freelancer.com job offers, and 60% of the jobs are fake.

Some Employers(registered person as want to hire) are fake and scammers.
Some Job Hunting persons(registered user as want a Job) are scammers too.

I therefore conclude that Freelancer.com website is were scammers meet up.

Freelancer.com is not safe for job hiring or hiring website.

Job hunt is not easy but there are faking.
Hiring is not easy, waste of money if your scam.

if the post will be deleted it means they have read this post.

263,"The website I used was called Freelancer.com.
First I used the website because I wanted to hire someone to help my project at my graduate school.
In the process, I saw the icon saying Guaranteed.
I often see sign Guaranteed  as Money back guaranteed so I thought it was too.

Then I posted the work project, some people posted the entries.
But most of them was not related to my request, and very low quality. 

Then I decided to close my project because these are something I cant hire.
First I contacted the costumer support and the person named Rochelle J said they will refund.
Then later another person contacted me and they said they cant close my project and cant refund because it was Guaranteed project.
They said Guaranteed  means that it was guaranteed for the freelancers that someone get the job.

(They have ""Guaranteed project"" and ""Money Back Guaranteed project"". Which sounds confusing. They said I would have money back if I chosen ""Money back guaranteed"" project.)

And as I dispute my transection through PayPal , Then they stopped my account and closed my project. Which I don't get provided anything.

Even they closed my project they still have my $169.
I simply didnt receive anything from them and I paid $169.

Freelancer.com said to me that they can reopen project but I don't want to use the service anymore because the quality is very low like if 5-year-old children worked on them. Also my project is already over and I just want to have my money back.

I didn't get provide anything from them and they hold my $169. 

2.. They present the word ""Guaranteed"" to the client in the purchasing process. Which doesn't mean its ""money back guaranteed "" but its guaranteed FOR FREELANCERS that someone would get hired even the client is not happy with the works. Isn't it kind of tricking or scam? If guaranteed not means to the client, shouldn't they use other words to describe? (""Not money back guaranteed"" etc...) Because I thought it was money back guaranteed. 
They have both ""Guaranteed"" (no money back) and ""Money back guaranteed"" (money back ) options. But isn't that too confusing?

Hi Sunny,

Thank you for reaching Freelancer.com Support Desk.

We understand that you wish to be refunded of the fee that you incurred for accepting the project ""Do some data entry"" (ID: 12536262). Please note that project fees are non-refundable regardless of the outcome of the project. This is the reason why we strongly suggest that you be meticulous when you accept a project award. It is also recommended that you ask for a pending Milestone Payment to be created first so that you can be assured that your employer has the funds to pay you for your services.

Nevertheless, we can review your refund request once the project gets canceled. We suggest that you ask your employer to cancel the project first. If they will remain unresponsive, you may request to cancel the project on your end. This option is available on the project page seven days after the proposed deadline. Once requested, your employer will be notified of this. If they will not cancel the project after 28 days, the system will automatically cancel the project.

Feel free to contact us back should you need further assistance.

""BELOW IS MY RESPONSE TO THEIR FAKE EMAIL TO ME""
=================================================

please stop fooling yourself, I know that this is Scam simple, how can your company survive with Scamming innocent people?
You said.

NO 1)  the EMPLOYER is fake (the account is created by your company to steal people money , ie, Awarding fake project)

NO 2) According to you message, I quote""  This is the reason why we strongly suggest that you be meticulous when you accept a project award. It is also recommended that you ask for a pending Milestone Payment to be created first so that you can be assured that your employer has the funds to pay you for your services.

THEN I ask: (A) IF you are serious and sincere and not part of the group creating fake accounts to award fake contracts, just to steal innocent people money, Tell me what an outsider who is not part of your SCAM GROUP can gain from wasting his time to create fake account just to award people fake contract - targeting to make innocent poor people waste their money? (THIS POINT make is obvious to the public to know that your company is scam)

(B) Tell me why you put such scam,cruel and wicked policy of stealing people money upfront just because they innocently and of course desperate to get job then ""ACCEPT FAKE project"" put up by your ""SCAM GROUP"" , why didn't you change that policy since people have been hurt seriously through it? you charge and deduct people money as you wish without their consent - so many people are crying for this, 

(C) How come you are not making this an important issue by creating ""Serious Awareness"" and ""Educating people through ""VIDEO and Advert"" about that upfront charges and the consequences of accepting PROJECT without proper verification of the Employer"" - (of course your company supposed to do those verification work on behalf of the freelancers, since you are getting your fees from their work) - Instead your awareness is to push Freelancers to Accept the job very fast, telling them if they fail to accept it very fast it will be Awarded to someone else-(Wicked Scam - to steal their money) ""if you even have that warning at all, it means you hide it where nobody can notice it, so that you will always quote it to innocent victims that you already stole their money who is fighting back - just to prove to them that you are Legal and have the right in stealing their money, this is why I call your company ( LEGAL SCAMMERS )

(D) Instead of running too much advert telling people to upgrade or pay to make their BID stand the chance to be awarded fake projects, why not take your time to EDUCATE people obviously about accepting fake projects consequences and Educate them how it will not help them to make money from your website, don't you know that every freelancer on your site is Jobless and in need of Job to feed their family? ""instead you steal from them""

Conclusion you know yourself that you are SCAMMER COMPANY, Everyone knows your company as SCAMMERS, we are creating AWARENESS to educate people about your company scam, 

I have reported your company to so many Authorities with all the points I quoted above and even more points not listed here, just everything I study from your website how you scam people, I have given them to the Authorities, SO CONTINUE YOUR SCAM, TILL THEY WILL GET TO YOU SOON.

Freelancer told me that they had closed the account of my client but unfortunately had to return the money to the bank, then they took out $ 1000 of my balance that I had at that time and also I was left with a negative balance of $ 1100, now I am working with upwork.com and I go excellent, I do not recommend at all freelancer, it´s a extremely  unsafe platform.",1,“Terrible Experience !!”

298,I've never made an actual dollar from freelancer. They tricked me into taking on a job that took $33 from my Paypal account and then no response. Won't give me my money back. What a complete scam.,1,“What a scam. Took my money and won't give it back.” 
299,"site is a total scam - even if you manage to find and complete a real project in the middle of the 99% fake ones (people do not pay for post works, so they post all sort of random things and then ask you to work for free) you pay their fee *IN ADVANCE* and you complete your work - even if you have previous completed reviews at any moment your withdrawals can be locked because ""we're waiting for your customer to verify"" (mean anyone can cheat you EVEN IF YOU USE THEIR MILESTONE SYSTEM)

DO NOT USE IT, AND FOR ANY ANY REASON NEVER EVER EVER USE THEIR MILESTONE/PAYMENT SYSTEM, THEY WILL CHEAT YOU IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE",1,“Total fraud site” 
300,"If you are using this website to make money, chances are you are losing money instead of making any. The membership fee is ridiculously high and the process to cancel is misleading. There is also a minimum $5 fee for each project. My financial situation would be much better if I never used this website!!",1,“Would give no star if I could” 
301,"Terrible payment methods in which you will often be left waiting for a withdrawal for upwards of three weeks. This alone deserves terrible reviews in the year 2016, as no system has to operate like this.",1,“Outdated And Infuriating” 
302,"Here's how it works: 
You bid on a project and get awarded the job. If it is a job for $100 you IMMEDIATELY see freelancer.com take their $10 commission from your bank account. What have you got so far? You may think you have a job, but in actual fact you have NOTHING WHATSOEVER! 
After getting awarded the 'job' you now chat to the 'employer' (read 'scammer') who refuses 9 times out of 10 to pay money into the escrow account (the so-called 'Freelancer milestone system'). Why the refusal? Because the 'employer' is hoping you are f*cking stupid enough to do the work and naively send it to him/her without payment protection so they can steal your work and disappear without paying. If you refuse to work without money in escrow - wait for it, THIS IS THE BEST PART! - then the f*cking scammer can cancel the 'job' and claim you didn't do the work and leave you a one star review which sits there on your profile and makes everyone think you're a bad freelancer when your only sin is that you didn't want some scammer to steal your work.
LET US REVIEW WHAT FREELANCER.COM HAS DELIVERED:
1. They have taken your $10
2. They have given you the opportunity of a heartwarming chat with a scammer
3. They have allowed the scammer to cancel the 'job' and leave you a one star review

BUT HEY, WHO THE F*CK CARES - FREELANCER.COM GOT THEIR $10 'COMMISSION'!

(By the way, in case you thought you could write to their 'support team' and complain - THEY DO NOT HAVE ONE!)

I have said it before and will say it once more: STAY AWAY FROM THIS RUBBISH SITE!",1,"“Absolute rubbish! A quick way for Freelancers to lose money, nothing more! Stay away!” "
303,"1. First I will talk about their ""guaranteed"" contests. You can submit free work and they say they will guarantee the payment, I participated in a guaranteed contest with ID 878221 and client asked me several times for modifications which I did. Time passed I waited for a winner (I was top contestant, but I was not picked by client and client disappeared). Now according to their policies it was freelancer.com's job to come in and distribute reward among top entries but what they did was unbelievable. They DELETED the ""guaranteed"" contest without rewarding any freelancer. Now read the response from their support team: ""We recently have done some improvement to make the site more secured for valuable users, like you. Hence, the system automatically deletes contests that may cause liability to us and its users. On a different note, you may earn more from contests when you are picked a winner. This will give you higher earnings, good ratings, and feedback, which will help you be awarded more contests and/or projects.""

2. Second kind of fraud is more pathetic and shameless, you apply for a job, you are hired, you are paid, project ends, you receive 5 star feedback. WOW great! But after that they can close the project take back money form your account, yes trust me they did this. My money was stolen after I received 5 star feedback form client. Don't know if it went back to client's pocket or Matt Barrie's pocket I don't care but this is a fact they can screw you at anytime, it could have made sense if I was kicked when project was not complete but doing this after project is closed and feed backs are exchanged is the most shameless scam I ever faced.

I have screenshots of these scams and I am sharing for those who believe it is not possible on earth.",1,“List of frauds of freelancer.com” 
304,They did not let me know they where taking money from my account. I just looked at my bank statement. I was like my goodness what is this payment for. I was under the guise that i was making a one time payment for the ability to make bids and be verified. Little did i know they where taking 10$ a month from me after that. When i send them a email expressing my concern they tell me to wait until the end of month to cancel because then i would be waisting money. In the email when i told them to cancel it they just told me to. There is no phone number to call and they will not refund me. Scam alert stay away... dont give them your info.,1,“Freelancer.com modern pickpocket” 
305,"Horrible, it just a piece of _)(*#($_#... I just had wrote this to them: 

I'm trying to verify my identity. I had tried to do that before without success and without any feedback about the reason. 

I will try this again. I will upload my driver licence and for the id document and a digital photo of a bank issue. I will alter the document because You shouldn't know anything about the credit limit, last balance, card number, or anything else. I thinks is too much information and I will never give you all that information and if I get hacked be sure I will take action about that because unique people that I will provide too much information about me is to you.... And yes, I don't trust in you but I'm just playing your game, because you don't trust in my and ask me to give you validation of everything, but you can hack me. 

I will try again but, you should accept that you are asking a lot of data, I'm also thinking to open a thread in quora about that because is too dangerous to allow a company to know everything about you. You could lost control of one employ and my data can be leaked. 

I think is too offensive your politics about identification and worst the address section is just bad as trash, you ask me about postal code... but in my country we don't use that information, so why $#*!ing $#*! is that field required? is freelancer a page done only for us workers? 

I'm pretty upset with freelancer, I think is just horrible and I hope some better service come to the community of freelancer because you don't care about giving a good service, you just want take money from what people work.

I hope that I can transfer my money as soon as possible. After that, I will delete my account and I and not just deleted , I want that all register about me be removed from database, backups, hard disk, memories, papers, your mind, from everything, I won't never use freelancer and I won't never recommend you, conversely I will give a very but immensely bad feedback to anyone.

And I won't like your service support, I had already told you that is horrible, it take days in answer. So If you want, validate my identity if no well don't do it, just give me my money and forget about me. 

Do you know what..., I had decided to cancel the verification, I'm just upset, if you want a validation I can send you my id and the code but not a bank issue or anything else. You are pretty mistrustful people, you think everybody will try you cheat you. No, not everybody is trying to cheat you, I'm just a young man that worked for a mexican for one month for just $350, you got your money and I want my money because after all, I was who did the job.

And look this https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/www.freelancer.com everybody hate you. Last I just want my money in the bank account. All my money.

306,"I signed up for Freelancer.com without doing very much research, as it *seemed* on the up-and-up, but a few minutes after logging on, auto-scripts were creating fake projects for me, mass-bidding of freelancers was taking place and the site was trying to take payments from my CC/Paypal (which I had wisely not entered yet) and demanding payment. The site even requires a $5 payment to delete these fictitious ""projects"" the auto-script creates - can you believe it?

When I found that a double charge was made, I wrote to them and was told that the money will be refunded.  In a week or so when I checked my PayPal account, the money was not returned, and since then nightmare began.  

Since freelancer.com knows and acknowledged that a double charge was made, they could have simply returned the credit to my PayPal account, and this is what a ""normal"" person would expect from a ""normal"" business operation.  Instead, freelancer.com has been coming up with all kind of B...S... not to returning the money.  Worse yet, they are NOT even paying the contractor, although all milestones are met, and payment to contractor from the money that is already fully paid by me to them on the first day of project start, is simply amazing business practice I can not imagine.  They are blaming that my account is locked (or ""limited access"") and blaming me and my dispute for asking for money back that they took illegally as the reason. How clever!!

They are all showing excellent designs but most of them are stolen form others. You will release some milestones for work that was done but even nothing tangible is delivered you may end up paying for everything because you either did not respond in time or that lousy provider raised dispute. Freelancer.com without checking anything can just transfer money to the provider any you'll end up with no money and undelivered project.

I eas just browsing around with no idea what I was doing its a new platform for me and all of the sudden im doing a contest with 97 dollares charged on my card. I am never usung that webpage again.",1,“Its a scam” 
334,"Freelancer.com is full of scam policies, hired freelancer, he didn't completed my project but I have to pay full amount as I can not cancel the milestone payments, only freelancer can. If they want to trick you it's easy for them and you are helpless. 

The Freelancer.com support will ask you to file a dispute which need 5 days to complete. If freelancer respond with just one word sorry, freelancer.com will ask you to pay a arbitration frees of $5 because he responded, and you have to waste 7 days again. My question is:

1. Why a employer need to pay extra arbitration fees when they paid all project fees in advance. 

2. Why they dont bother to see the reply of freelancer before they escalate it to 3rd stage? 

3. Why cant an employer cancel a milestone payment if freelancer is not responding? 

4. Who will compensate employer for time loss when project delayed by using tricks.

I was just trying to clean up my dashboard area so that it can look cleaner.  Now who charges money to delete any old entries????  This is never heard of ever in my life!!

Because they do such fraudulent activities, they don't have a customer service phone number and you can only chat with them.  Chatting takes forever to convey and come to a resolution!! A 5 mins call takes 1.5 hours.  STAY AWAY FROM THEM!!!",1,“Fraud website all together.” 
337,"This page has a terrible disorganization as customers who hire a freelancer and contests when paying. Especially in contests with the method of delivery is literally a scam ... the client disappears when one goes up the files after winning the contest. Then the freelancer ends working for free. And not only that is the problem with the page, for more ther charge a membership that I have not asked.. for one month trying to put it down and I always continued with the same then as could I call that? thieves is the only word that comes to my mind. If you want to offer a better service, have better control of employers! be responsible and pay the freelancer for those customers who do not pay and disappear in the contests.

I can't login because freelancer thinks I did not use a valid ID(I send my valid drivers licensed), I only ask to changed my username from XXX to YYY for the reason the name I used when still my wife was is living, so I would like to change username(fancy reason for good name), but freelancer banned me, its better I did not ask to changed my username.  But someone from freelancer as a good member of Board of Directors(I think) I meet, he helped me restore my account after explaining to him in Facebook.

2nd > my account was hold, I can no longer bid projects because my previous client who pays me  uses a fake credit card that worth $288(I think), and was charged to my account, freelancer says I have to pay it to restore back my account that has 15 good reviews(I think),  and because I have nothing to turn around for work so I have to make another account, now I'm back to zero(0to2) reviews, it's hard to meet some clients if you have no good feedback.

and also:
They deduct amount percentage of work even the client or employer did not released milestone for payment, so instead your looking for money from their help, they're the one who grab you down.

I complied with them and submitted 4 scanned copies of government issue documents, a day later they closed my account. I had a lot of money in my account and was working with a client.

345,"Freelancer.com doesn't protect freelancers.

This is my conclusion.

I have the great experience working with Freelancer.com during the last 7 years.
During that period I had seen many situations and had taken a part starting from unfounded complaints to unfounded refunds.

This is normal practice for Freelancer.com to hold or block money and get them back.
This is normal when you had taken a project and after 2-3 days of your work (spent time) you got a letter from Support that the Employer's account had been blocked and they had to refund.
This is normal that after 2-3 month any employer can claim or create a dispute on the Milestone's which had been released and get money back.
This is normal when the Dispute Team acts like a judge ignoring agreement and listing between Users.

I think many other freelancers can add own situations to the list.

The absurdity lies in the fact that if I have in the account the money I have earned for months, they can block them all and return back anytime.

Time from time I loose my money from Freelancer.com because of their stupid policy.

At the moment I use alternative methods to find employers.

And I hope I will not be dependent on the site Freelancer.com in the close future.",1,“Freelancer.com doesn't protect freelancers” 
346,"Freelancer.com is a huge scam. I'm sure there are legitimate work opportunities on Freelancer, but that was NOT my experience. I was new to the site and still in the process of getting my portfolio set up. Out of the blue, an employer wanted to hire me for a $600.00 job for which I hadn't even placed a bid. I guess I got ahead of myself and accepted the job without thoroughly checking out the employer. 

Within SECONDS of clicking the ""Accept"" button, Paypal notified me of a $60.00 charge from Freelancer--a fee for which I'd not even been given the chance to approve or decline. A few hours later, the employer, ableGODartistry, canceled the job and completely deleted their account. When I contacted Freelancer for a refund, they told me that the money would NOT be refunded even though I never actually did any work or earned any money. They said that the $60 charge I paid was their fee for ""introducing"" me to the employer. I read on another site where this is something that Freelancer does on a regular basis--they, themselves, create a dummy employer, get some newbie to accept the fake job, and then cancel the job and the account while keeping the fees that the worker had to pay up front. Even the employer's name was extremely similar to the employer who ""hired"" me. That can't be a coincidence. 

I finally got them to give me Freelancer ""credit"", but I'm still waiting to see if they will actually refund my PayPal account. 

NEVER. AGAIN.",1,“Freelancer.com Commits Outright Fraud” 
347,"freelancer.com introduces a recruiter team which is why they charge 15% when a job is assigned to a preferred freelancer. The recruiter team tasks not only to invite but also to give feedback, answer of your any question and if you are skilled they should also recommend you or if you have some drawback they can inform that but they don't follow this.",1,“The recruiter team is not cooperative” 
348,"I am sure some of you would receive emails from freelancer.com that you are offered a project by a client. DO NOT ever click any link or button stated ""View and accept offer"" in the email. If you do so like me, you will lose 10% of your money based on the offer price. Those clients who file the project and offer you directly are mostly unverified. They are out to scam you. Once the button is clicked, freelancer.com straightaway deduct your money and assume that you have accepted the offer. You do not even have the chance to check on the client project or read the project description.I have talked to their customer support, but none of them is willing to refund the money to you. The CS will ask you to contact the client yourself to get back the money and nothing can be done. In short, it is a trap for freelancers who are unaware how the links or button in the freelancer.com email works. If you are unsure whether to accept the offer or not, PLEASE key in the website URL directly and check from your dashboard. DO NOT EVER click any link/buttons provided in the email. You are bound to LOSE your money. You will never ever get to see the money again.",1,“Beware of Freelancer.com scam” 
349,"I made the mistake if trying Freelancer.Com inspite of the overwhelming negative reviews. The reason I was tempted is because they were running a promotion where the freelancer would not pay any commission. Which sadly turned out to be a scam as well.

The site service itself is a bunch of fetaures loosly cobbled together with a workflow that barely works if at all. Most things have at lease 6 ways to get to them. Example payments to freelancers are done via these things called milestones. there are at least 3 different ways of accessing these milestones and depending on which method the functionality set is all different. Also with this example there is no clear navigation hierarchy to get to these. In short the freelancer.com portal is a poorly written almost cobbled together piece of junk.

To make matters worse the executive management who decide how to run this company have absolutely no integrity: A company that does not honor its word really has no future in the internet market. They will run promotions but have absolutely no intention of honoring that.

21:37 Tikiri Wickramasingha: ""2. Fees Waived""
21:38 Lorraine A.: This program allows freelancers to share their unique affiliate code on their own website or email signatures through the Freelancer Hire Me Badge. When new employers sign up on the site via this affiliate code/link and hire the referrer, they can complete projects with zero project fees for both parties.

21:39 Tikiri Wickramasingha: So what does this affiliate code look like ?
21:40 Tikiri Wickramasingha: Would it look like https://www.freelancer.com/hireme/chillx
21:40 Tikiri Wickramasingha: or https://www.freelancer.com/hireme/******

21:42 Lorraine A.: Give me the username of the person you refer. 
21:43 Tikiri Wickramasingha: No I'm trying to understand what the referred person needs to do ?
21:43 Tikiri Wickramasingha: besides completing that page
21:43 Tikiri Wickramasingha: The page comes up and says Pay 0% project commission with XYZ
21:43 Tikiri Wickramasingha: and then you enter the details and say create account
21:44 Tikiri Wickramasingha: That is how I signed up on Freelancer.com
21:44 Lorraine A.: They should enter this ""https://www.freelancer.com/hireme/chillx"" when they sign up in the site.
21:44 Tikiri Wickramasingha: the link I used was https://www.freelancer.com/hireme/******
21:44 Tikiri Wickramasingha: I am the person running the projects

21:44 Tikiri Wickramasingha: I clicked that link and signed up
21:44 Lorraine A.: I did not see that you used the link when you signed in.
21:45 Tikiri Wickramasingha: explain ?
21:45 Tikiri Wickramasingha: ****** sent me that link on Whatsapp
21:45 Tikiri Wickramasingha: I clicked it on my mobile and filled in the form and signed up
21:46 Tikiri Wickramasingha: So what is the issue ?
21:46 Lorraine A.: These are the following criteria that must be met by the referred employer to be considered as a successful referral. See below:

21:46 Lorraine A.: -Has never visited Freelancer.com.

21:47 Tikiri Wickramasingha: yes true
21:47 Tikiri Wickramasingha: I've never used freelancer.com
21:47 Lorraine A.: - Doesn't have an existing Freelancer.com account.

21:47 Tikiri Wickramasingha: yes true
21:47 Tikiri Wickramasingha: I joined by clicking that link https://www.freelancer.com/hireme/******
21:48 Tikiri Wickramasingha: Prior to this ****** was working for me using Upwork.Com for about 3 to 4 months
21:49 Tikiri Wickramasingha: The one and only reason for me to even try freelancer.com is that offer of yours where ****** would not have to pay the comission of 10%
21:49 Lorraine A.: Please give me more time to review your concern because some details are still being confirmed.

21:50 Tikiri Wickramasingha: What does that mean

22:02 Lorraine A.: Check it again.
22:02 Tikiri Wickramasingha: Ok I can now open the ticket
22:02 Tikiri Wickramasingha: well here is the issue:
22:02 Tikiri Wickramasingha: This is what you have said:
22:03 Tikiri Wickramasingha: Hi Tikiri,

Thank you for contacting Freelancer.com Support.

We understand that this is inconvenient for you. We already forwarded your issue to our Engineering Department. We will notify you once we receive a response from them.

If there is anything else that I can help you with, please let us know.
22:03 Tikiri Wickramasingha: no where does it mention what the issue is
22:03 Tikiri Wickramasingha: so the next time I speak to someone 
22:03 Tikiri Wickramasingha: I go through this same process again
22:03 Tikiri Wickramasingha: FYI this is the 3rd time
22:03 Tikiri Wickramasingha: Can you please edit that ticket and put the details of what the issue is please
22:04 Lorraine A.: No, we will be contacting you regarding this. Our engineers knows already about this.
22:04 Tikiri Wickramasingha: right but your ticket is so vague
22:04 Tikiri Wickramasingha: Here is what will happen
22:04 Tikiri Wickramasingha: no one will contact me
22:04 Tikiri Wickramasingha: then later I will try find someone and give them the ticket
22:05 Tikiri Wickramasingha: then they will say what is the ticket about
22:05 Tikiri Wickramasingha: I will say what it is about 
22:05 Tikiri Wickramasingha: and they will say well This ticket is something else
22:05 Lorraine A.: I keep a separate note for the engineers to see and they will know what is the issue.
22:05 Tikiri Wickramasingha: and I start the thing all over again
22:05 Tikiri Wickramasingha: Can you add to the ticket that my issue is to do with the hire me program zero commissions offer
22:06 Tikiri Wickramasingha: I might not get you the next time. I might get Lying Brian
22:06 Lorraine A.: I already add it to the note.
22:06 Tikiri Wickramasingha: Or I might get Darnell who denies that such a program even exists
22:07 Tikiri Wickramasingha: I am looking at the ticket right now
22:08 Tikiri Wickramasingha: What is the problem to add ""issue is to do with the hire me program zero commissions offer"" to the ticket
22:08 Lorraine A.: As I told you we keep a note there, but this is not visible to the users.
22:08 Tikiri Wickramasingha: So in other words this is what you are telling me
22:09 Tikiri Wickramasingha: You do not want to commit to anything so therefore you have created a vague ticket about some issue without specifying what it is. Therefore if I should at a later date question anyone about this then they can just say well we dont know what the issue is about on the ticket
22:09 Tikiri Wickramasingha: so in short no commital
22:09 Lorraine A.: I had put the title referral code, when they see that they will know.
22:10 Tikiri Wickramasingha: Should I be adding my experience with freelancer to the list of more than 800 on https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/www.freelancer.com?rating=1
22:10 Tikiri Wickramasingha: and many other sites
22:10 Tikiri Wickramasingha: except I will do so including an extreme amount of detail about the experience
22:11 Tikiri Wickramasingha: SO far Freelancer has been a nightmare for me.
22:11 Tikiri Wickramasingha: This chat is perhaps the best experience so far and it is far from ideal
22:11 Tikiri Wickramasingha: because at the end of the day it is clear to you that I signed up with freelancer specifically for that program
22:12 Tikiri Wickramasingha: However you would rather go through a whole bunch of unnecessary and ridiculous processes to defer and whatever
22:12 Lorraine A.: i am trying to help you the best possible way I can.
22:12 Tikiri Wickramasingha: I know Lorraine
22:12 Tikiri Wickramasingha: the issue is not with you Lorraine
22:12 Tikiri Wickramasingha: you have done everything you can within what you are allowed to do
22:13 Lorraine A.: I understand that this is frustrating, however, issue has already been escalated.
22:13 Tikiri Wickramasingha: Freelancer.Com executive management are a bunch of con artists / scams / thieves / and scoundrels exactly as the reviews say
22:13 Tikiri Wickramasingha: Many thanks for doing your best Lorraine
22:14 Lorraine A.: You have my word, we will contact you once we verify your claim about the referral code.
22:14 Tikiri Wickramasingha: Please try and find yourself another job. This company freelancer.com is not worth people like you
22:14 Tikiri Wickramasingha: I wish you all the best
22:15 Tikiri Wickramasingha: and hope you have a most amazing weekend
22:15 Lorraine A.: Would that be all for today?

22:15 Tikiri Wickramasingha: One more thing: please let your team manager / senior manager / whatever the management structure is
22:16 Tikiri Wickramasingha: Please let them know that until they fix this and send me a written apology for the runaround I will keep using Upwork and will not bother with Freelancer.Com

22:17 Tikiri Wickramasingha: My hourly rate is 110 NZD per hour
22:17 Tikiri Wickramasingha: AS you can see hassle just aint worth it for me
22:18 Lorraine A.: My apologies for the inconvenience. 
22:18 Tikiri Wickramasingha: You have a most amazing weekend Lorraine. And I trust that your engineering team / whatever team will just keep mucking me around until I get completely frustrated and close the account
22:19 Tikiri Wickramasingha: Wish you all the best in your carreer and good night / good day
22:19 Tikiri Wickramasingha: Bye for now
22:19 Lorraine A.: I assure you that our engineering team is handling this issue.

350,"I went on this website to start my work as a freelancer working on spreadsheets. They are AWFUL.

I went on and didn't have many leads, which is fine. When I finally got some work, they took out a huge portion - again, that's fine. I continued my membership, which was the cheapest one, but when I put in my credit card information, they upgraded me without my permission. It was a pain in the ass to get back my money.

Later, I put in a bid to do some work for someone. It was valued at about 200USD. I was given the bid on accident and then denied. Freelancer took their cut anyway, even though there was no cut to be had, since i never got the money from the project. I complained for at least a month, then finally got my SOME of my money back. 

I ended up with a balance of +60, when it should have been +300. At that point, I was so frustrated I just decided to clear my account and cancel my membership. I COULDN'T EVEN PULL OUT MY OWN MONEY!!! They said it was tied up because I was still locked into a bid. I told them to cancel the bid and just give me my money. They wouldn't do it.... eventually I just gave up and told them to keep the money, and just cancel my account.

352,Freelancer is just another web site (supposed) to put freelancers/employees in contact with employers. But lately freelancer has become a money grab. But the biggest problem is their 'Qualified' and 'Preferred' and other ratings/gimmicks. Seems to me that freelancer now employs people and use them as 'pseudo freelancers' - in other words they show EVERY sign of being a business that sub-contracts people in THEIR EMPLOY (scamming?) of various skills than a simple labour exchange that makes 'a buck' (3%+) on the side. Freelancer has got the last bit of money from me and I wait for the day they go 'belly up' very soon!  Not to mention the project quality really sucks and looks like most projects are BOGUS! The Australian government should investigate them as I have serious doubts about Australia and the economy too (I still wonder how they were able to become a public company)!,1,“Freelancer.com has become a self appointed Labour God!” 
353,"I went on to Freelancer.com in order to have an artist design our company logo.  I decided to run a contest in order to draw the best talent. I chose a budget, but by the time I finished with all of the ""extras"" I had more than doubled my budget.  Being new to the site I thought it would be worth the extra expense. 
By pressing the guarantee button, more of what they consider artist would pay attention to my post due to the fact that I promised to pay.  I sent a few examples of what we were looking for.  80% of the entries were copyrighted items straight off the internet.  One of the entries took one of the images that I presented as an example and submitted that same image right back as an entry! 
Don't get me wrong 20% of the artist did come up with creative ideas and I did chose a winner that I was very pleased with.  However, even having all of the artist (which I paid extra for) sign a NDA, one posted their horrific entry on the internet for all to see.  Seriously, they took the Heinz Ketchup logo and replaced the wording with my company name.  I am not happy.  
I contacted Freelancer.com to make them aware that one of their artist was not in keeping with the NDA agreement.  After 24 hours of ""research"" I received a reply from Freelancer.com that stated that it was my problem and that if I wanted to do something about it I was on my own.  They advised me to contact an attorney.  I was shocked that they wouldn't even agree to contact the artist to discipline them, warn them or prohibit them from further participation on the site. 
Most of the artist on Freelancer.com are doodlers without a creative bone in their body.  They just search the internet for existing art and pass it off as their own.  Which is against the rules of course but since no one is policing the site to protect the business owners, you know, the ones who are actually paying to keep the site alive by spending their hard earned money, then I do not see this getting any better. With the guarantee the artists know no matter what they present they will get paid.  
I will not use this site again for new projects.  However, I will be contacting the artist that won my contest directly, as he is a true artist.

354,"Dear colleagues, 

Never ever start having a deal with this establishment. 
The mechanism they steal your money is quite simple:
1) you place your bid 
2) you are awarded
3) in a couple of minutes your project is marked as ""Incomplete"" and you are to pay 10% of its cost (which you have never received).
You have neither rights nor place to appeal. 

I am sorry for those people who had money on their accounts when these ""incompleteness"" happened. All their savings were simply stolen.
I was lucky enough to have 50 cents at the moment. Thus, I congratulated the fraudsters with the huge loot ;)
Nevertheless, the time I had spent to build my profile was gone for nothing.",1,“A bunch of scoundrels” 
355,"Freelancer has STOLEN funds from me, making multiple significant ($100+) charges to my account despite having not authorization or cause to do so.  

After having to dig through their site for nearly a day to find how to ""request a refund"" it took 17 interactions, 5 extremely clear demands and two whole weeks to refund the money... MINUS A DAMN TRANSACTION FEE!

On top of that, every single entry I received for jobs I posted were blatantly plagiarized from google images.  I even had one guy from India literally copy my job posting, word for word, post it as his own for a lower price, in an attempt to make money for himself.  He intended on making someone else do the work for my logo job, and sell it to mew for more money!  Freelancer apparently believes this is ok, as even after reporting it they've never responded. 

Multiple other people I have contacted who've used this site have have had the same issues.  My wife and her business partner used the site at roughly the same time as I, and had multiple erroneous charges appear on their account, and have yet to be able to get their money back.",1,“Thieves; both the site and the users.

359,"I left the following review of Freelancer's support team after they failed to address my issues.

READ THIS AND LEARN SOMETHING FOR ONCE:

This ""support"" ticket was filed because a contest holder assigned a random 2.5 stars to my entry following the contest handover.  He told me he did it just to release the money and didn't actually look at my work.  I presented undeniable proof of this in the form of pictures to Freelancer ""Support"" and asked to have the rating removed since it lowered my overall score and hurt my chances of finding future work.

They didn't.  Kept saying ""we strive to uphold the integrity of the review system.""  They needed the contest holder's permission but he never replied to my messages.  I kept at it for days and still nothing.  Freelancer sent him messages but he didn't reply to them either.  I asked if I could change his score and was told ""If it's from negative to positive, yes. But if not, we also need a confirmation.""  

So to change my score I need HIS confirmation. And to change his score I need HIS confirmation.

I asked if I could lodge a dispute and was told: ""A contest dispute can only be lodged by the contest holder.""   

So basically, the employer has ALL the power, and the freelancer has none.  That's how Freelancer treats its own people.

A few weeks before that I was ripped off by a con-artist who took my work and ran without paying me.  His profile was an exact copy of someone else on Freelancer but he was still payment, profile and email verified.  I didn't get my money because YOUR verification systems failed.

These and many prior experiences have made something very clear: Freelancer throws 100% of its support behind the employers and none behind its freelancers.  And I'm NOT the only one who feels this way.  Just Google ""Freelancer.com reviews"" and you'll see the scathing rebukes and horror stories.  

It's not a good sign when the word SCAM is repeated throughout.  And as for the reviews that say Best site ever or Dream come true.  Seriously, who are you fooling?  

Keep this up and eventually your social media black-eye will turn away both clients and freelancers.

It's already done that to me.  Since my bad experiences, I've been using Freelancer less and less and eventually plan on stopping altogether and opening up accounts with Upwork or Guru.

So to sum up: thanks for nothing.  All I asked was to have ONE bad review removed and presented incontrovertible proof as to why.  But I received nothing but excuses.  Every time I turn to you guys I feel cheated on top of being deceived. 

Your support staff is slow, ineffective, hugely incompetent, and reply with generic talking points.  I'm giving this survey 1 star to voice my dissatisfaction at your massive ineptitude, and I'm sure I won't be the only one.

For example if you take a 15$ project they will receive 5$ fee from the freelancer that took that project and 3$ from the employer + that tax that they take when you add money to their platform. And they have tons of fake projects that bots post.
As an employer you will find in 90% of the cases indians that are very aggressive and copy paste the same offer for every project. Most of them are paid just to make those offers and don't even know what needs to be done on your project.

So I raised another ticket in a different category. Suggested someone should try logging in as me to see the problem. Mentioned that as a multi-million dollar ASX listed company it was unlikely that they are a scam site, but something is definitely not working right.

24 hours later everything was cleaned up. They refunded my overpayment and unlocked my account. I paid Alberto. All good.

It took a week and a heap of hair-tearing and time-wasting. Obviously they don't waste shareholder funds on intelligent helpdesk people.

=============================================================

I signed up to get a project done. because of some static at my end, I actually signed up - and authorised $50 milestone twice. So I cancelled one of the projects and reversed the paypal payment.  They got all bent out of shape about that and locked my account.

I undid the reversal

The job got done. I am happy. Product has been delivered. So I authorise payment. Find that my account is locked and I need to verify my identity.  Then discover that I have to put my phone no in first so it an send me an SMS.  It tells me my account is limited and does not send an SMS. I need to go to the verifcation centre ....

I raised a ticket. ""Will be dealt with in 24 hours or so."" Three days ago after a few more days of ""answering questions"" (always the same one) in the verification screen.

402,"The short version is that:
a) freelancer has an unfair fee system
b) freelancer keeps fees even if you try to close the project a minute after you award it (mistakenly or otherwise)
c) freelancer does not provide real support during disputes unless you pay extra fees on top of the project fees they already collected

i am a client (not provider) and decided to try freelancer.com after spending countless thousands with elance/upwork. well, that was my first mistake. 

when i posted my first job i noticed that providers start to write proposals within seconds, and within minutes you will have the maximum 50+ bids on your project. i chose a provider that asked for a very small sum and had great feedback. that was mistake #2. his communication was not very good and i opted to cancel the project without any prejudice. i couldn't figure out how to 'close' the project and refund fees like i would on upwork. whatever i did ended up closing the project but left the provider with 10% fees from a project that never even started. i didn't know that and apologized and discussed it with him. provider stated that freelancer.co has screwed him out of 580 USD through their indisputable fee system and discriminate policies. 

my second project was with a provider who looked good but she began nitpicking about how the money is to be released. i disagreed with what she wanted and opted to close that project too. and once again i couldn't so i tried to end it the way i did the first project but the provider had put a lock on the milestone and i could not. so i 'disputed' the milestones and opened an official claim thinking that freelancer.com would be there to assist us in an obvious miscommunication and offer the one solution that everyone wanted -- no fees, project closed, everyone happy. That was my third mistake. Freelancer.com couldn't give a $hi+ less about either one of our needs. 

Freelancer.com repeatedly told me to 'work things out' with the provider and I wasted time writing numerous emails to them and their useless customer service team. I asked to escalate to a supervisor so that I can get a decision maker to simply refund the provider her 10% as a one-time courtesy but instead they repeated over and over that they don't give a $hi+ and it's our duty to work things out. They offered a paid 'arbitration' service where they will 'review' the dispute and make a decision (winner keeps his arbitration fee). The project never started, no work was completed, nothing was exchanged except some heated chats and emails and the result was nothing outside of freelancer.com taking a 10% commission through a fully automated system and a bit of 'support' from their customer service team that is likely in a third-world country office. Sorry, but that is what major companies do -- exploit poor nations to 'stimulate their economies' while paying a few hundred dollars a month to a full time overworked slave.

THAT IS WHY YOU SHOULD NOT USE FREELANCER.COM AND OPT TO USING GURU, UPWORK, ODESK OR OTHER SITES.

On their site they state their objective as 'providing a platform to connect people' and the rest is up to those people. In other words, no matter what the situation, once people agree to a project, freelancer.com take a fee and cite that they have a no-refund policy in case of issues.  

Where did they come up with a system that takes 10% for no reason? If my project was 10,000 USD then they would have taken 1000 USD for NOTHING and in case of a dispute they would have asked for additional payment to 'arbitrate' on top of that 1000.

426,"During my time on freelancer.com, I only participated in contests. 

These contests were absolutely horrifying. Nearly every user who entered had (1) completely ignored the guidelines set by the contest host, or (2) essentially copied the top-rated designs and then spammed the entry. Then they create fake accounts to ""like"" their own images & make them more visible.

But by far, the worst offense was that a ridiculous amount of users just stole images and logos from other sites, and did so without consequence.

I actually had a contest where I was the first to enter, I corresponded with the host to improve my design, and I spent upwards of 8 hours making something they would like. But when my design became the ""top pick"", a good 10 or 15 designers went and copied the image almost exactly. Even so, I thought I was fine because I was still rated the top design by the time the contest closed.

And then another designer, who was clearly using images stolen from google & photoshopped (mind you, the guidelines stated it was to be an ""illustration""), was awarded the prize at the last minute.

This was not Freelancer.com's fault, it was the host's decision. Regardless, that was the last straw for me. I'm not about to spend hours on an original design just to have the winner be someone who slapped together an image in 5 minutes, especially if they just essentially copied my entry. And I'm certainly not going to continue making designs for employers who couldn't care less about anything other than the end result, even if it's created illegally.

433,"If you are freelancer who wants to earn some money or make a living from your work, stay away from this site! There are many others which offer far better services and support than this one! We were working for some for some people from India, we have created for them many functionalities like login, register, payments, redesign... And we had a lot of harassment from their end. They refused to pay in the end because we didn't want to do additional staff for free (which weren't part of the project for which we bided). So we field a dispute hoping that their dispute team would solve this for us. After we have delivered all the evidence that we have created what was asked in project and documented for them, other party (employer) only provided few comments like evidence which were like, font was bigger than it supposed to be, or margin was a bit bigger here... 
None of the real evidence was delivered that some of the functionalities weren't working or that code was bad... 
In the end we were accused for communicating with employer on skype and they ended dispute in favor for employer.
Freelancer team said it was evident that their work was not approved by the buyer as the final output. Isnt it obvious that if they stick to original posted project we wouldnt have a problem? And that we wouldnt file a dispute?
If they have tested site and code, like they should when they have this kind of situations, they could see what was going on. This very much points to their unprofessional behavior and that someone who was doing it wasnt paying too much of attention while doing it. We were left with 47$ USD, which were released for first milestone. And for other two milestones for which we field a dispute freelancer said that we should get 0.00$.
 We were left with nothing for our work, freelancer took their cut from the dispute and from the full price that we should have received, and employer walks away with money and project. If you are missing some bad experience in life, freelancer is the site for you. If not than avoid it!
Look how much negative reviews they have here. It says a lot about them.",1,“Avoid their services!” 
434,"The support on this site is f***ing terrible. Automated response after automated response. Here's my story. Over two months ago I signed up to use this site as a freelancer, I've made decent clients and a decent amount of money...but they won't give me that money. I put in for my first withdrawal, for this they have a 15 day waiting period for new freelancers, I get that, whatever, I waited. All of a sudden 15 days later, without reason, that transaction fails. Next I put in another withdrawal, still being patient. 15 days goes by, I'm looking in my account, nothing. Then I'm told I have to wait another 12 days for the withdrawal. If you're keeping count we're at 42 days of waiting to withdrawal a small amount of money. All the while I'm trying to explain this to support, asking politely what I can do to expedite the process, receiving these BS copy/ paste responses. Which brings us to this week, when suddenly on the day my withdrawal was supposed to come through I receive an email telling me that they've chosen to ""limit"" my account and I'm unable to make withdrawals. At that point I'm p*ssed, but they still have my money so I do what they say and send a scanned copy of my license, a scanned copy of proof of residency, a photograph of myself holding my ID. Then apparently they are trying to get in touch with my clients to see if I'm a real person. So my clients are getting these messages claiming the person they're working with may be, what, some kind of fake account? Tarnishing my reputation with the people paying me. Wish I had read some of these reviews before signing up.

Keep in mind I pay the subscription and they've made commission off every one of my projects. Leaving this review up unless all this bullsh*t gets resolved.

UPDATE: This whole process is making it obvious to my clients that this site is a scam and they aren't willing to put up additional personal information to get ""verified"" on the site, so it looks like this bullsh*t site is keeping all of my earnings for the last TWO MONTHS. Can't get in touch with them in any capacity other than the threatening messages they keep sending saying that if my clients don't complete this process soon they're keeping all the money in my account.

Update II: So now that my clients aren't willing to comply, Freelancer has taken the money out of my account, punishing me THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS COMPLIED and refunded my clients for the work I've done. Here's the catch - their accounts on the site are frozen too so that money is trapped in there. Now if they want to get that money back to me, they can't because they can't withdraw from their accounts. All the while the site is refusing to even get in contact with me anymore.

Couple of months back, my account got limited for a project worth $2000. 
I somehow submitted my documents to get it verified. My client, could not verify from his side so I insisted freelancer support to give back his money and atleast put off limit from my freelancer account so I can continue my work.

They did it. 

I was charged 200 USD for accepting that project though, so I had negative balance of -200 USD.

Which then reduced to just 119 USD.

Yesterday, I completed a project of 35 USD on freelancer, but I got only 10 USD overall.

They again limited my account for reason of reversal of deposit made by me from my credit card. I mean, Really??

Few days back, I had made my first ever deposit of 5 USD just to get the membership, & thats it!

This website is seriously full of spam with F rating customer service. They also charge you money to take exams where as other freelancer website such as Upwork does not. A client closed the project on me that has cause me losing 10% of ""his"" proposed money.
This month I started to look for gigs on Freelancer.com. After spending 60+ dollars on exams to look more qualified, someone contacted me for a 600 dollar virtual assistant gig. As we talked about the specific requirements, he wants me to contact him outside of freelancer.com. I sensed that this could be a spam so I refused. (Also in the terms and conditions we are not allowed to contact sellers outside of freelancer.com). As I waited for his response, he deleted the project and disappear all together. Later I checked my bank account and realized I had being billed 61 dollars without freelancer explicitly bill me anything when I accept the gig. I realized why they keep ask us to create a paypal account. I should have refused to create one. 
Contacted freelancer customer service, they told me I cannot get my money back. (There was no ""service"" provide to me, so why should I pay 61 to you Freelancer.com?) and the sellers' account has been closed. The gig has disappeared as well. 

I am seriously pissed off how this website exploit the already poor Freelancer by imposing numerous fees. I didn't even realized that they had asked me for a foreign transaction fee. No where mentioned. I will want to request all of the billing inquires and see how you guys lied to me!!

To the freelancer customer service rep:
Sorry I will never contact you through the useless email or ticketing system on Freelancer.com. I dare you respond to my request on here directly instead of handling everything ""behind the curtain"" so that you can ""delete any evidence as you wish"".

I am sick and tired of the terribly deceiving customer complaining system you had created on Freelancer.com.",1,“Getting Spamed” 
445,"I've been using freelancer for 5 months now, and have had a few minor difficulties along the way. The last one, however, was a doozy.  After running a project through, my bank account was riddled with additional (unexplained) charges from Freelancer, coming from Switzerland, so my bank stopped future payments to them. 

After trying to make a legitimate charge, my bank denied the charge due to the suspicious activity mentioned above. After calling my bank to approve the legitimate charge, they cautioned me to be careful and DO NOT GIVE THEM ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION. I was able to deposit money into my Freelancer account after that, but when I tried to release the money to an artist, I was informed I couldn't release the money because of a security reasons. The solution (after getting a robot email response from customer 'service' was that I needed to give them my telephone number to verify that the money they had put into my account was secure - even though I've spent $2000+ on 8 different projects already). They wanted my phone number, even though a financial institution told me not to give them any personal information. I told Freelancer I couldn't give them my phone number and their response? Nothing. They email that it is for security reasons, but the response is the exact same wording with no clarifications. I've tried to chat online, never gotten an agent to actually chat, I've sent multiple emails and gotten the same respnse without explanation, and (here's the ironic part) haven't been given a phone number to call them about this. Now I have an artist who has delivered her work, I have funds that Freelancer is holding, and they won't let me release them to the artist or return them to me until I give them information my bank told me not to give them. One frustrating thing is that if you do open a ticket, they will respond with a cookie-cutter respond and then mark the issue as resolved....even though it hasn't even been addressed!

Bottom line? It seemed like it had a few problems at first, but now they appear to be downright shady. The fact that banks and credit card companies flag their activity as suspicious should be a clue about the company's way of doing business. Upwork.com is light years ahead on service and security.

UPDATE: Freelancer responded, saying they needed my phone number for security, so thank you for responding! Unfortunately, I'm still not sure how you having my phone number assures security or why it is asked for 6 months after joining the site and $2000+ later, or why their patterns of billing activity threw off suspicious activity alerts at both my credit card company and my bank. 

I also still find it curious that they need my phone number for security reasons, but they refuse to give out their own phone number to customers...",1,“Wow. I've never seen customer service this horrible in all my life. Wow.”

While freelancer did eventually refund the money taken without authorisation, it was an utterly painful process, that took a very long time to get fixed. Still warn people to not use this service, and stay away!",1,“RUN AWAY FAST!” 
447,"They stole $1000 from me. I hired a guy from there that after 3 weeks said he could not finish the job anymore for me and was going to cancel the $1000 payment and refund me the $100.  The money was never refunded and freelancer.com have ignored all of my messages. Then they lied to paypal by providing them with fake evidence showing there was a website built, after arguing with paypal for a hr I finally got the website address freelancer claims to of made for me and all it is, is my  name on a website that is under construction. I think Paypal is working with them because they make money from working with Freelancer.com

Now I am $1000 short with no website.... They literally stole $1000 from me then froze my account and will not email me back or respond to any of my messages.

Lets put a stop to this",1,“Freelancer.com is a scam company” 
448,"Ok, my story is as follows. 
Back in December 2015 I commissioned a developer to build an app for me. The agreed price was £2700 but Freelancer added hidden charges for the international conversion from USD to GBP and passed them onto me. Disgusting act ONE. This ended up as a final total of around £2912. I disputed this with them and I should have realised what I was letting myself in for when robots (or that's how i can describe them) kept repeating the same line about this being my fault etc etc. In the end, they agreed in writing to waive this fee as long as I deposited another £2700 into my wallet and they would refund the original amount back to. Like I have £2700 lying around to give to this bunch of crooks!

So fast forward 2 months and the app is built and the milestone payments released. I then decided enough was enough regarding the extra conversion charge Freelancer levied on me so I asked my bank to carry out a chargeback on the £212. The bank duly refunded me this money back. 

Now, you would think this would be the end of it. NO, not with these thieves. Through their obscure terms and conditions they took wait for it...£2200 out of my developer's wallet blaming my chargeback action for it. Yes, they actually have done that! 

The knock on effect of this has been horrendous. I can't get my app off my developer as he is £2200 out of pocket through Freelancer taking his money and I am £2700 out of pocket without an app to show for it. The winner: FREELANCER! who sit there nice and pretty with other peoples' money. 

So, they then ask me to go through their ""verification centre"" where someone new comes on every 7 days to send one line of rubbish about cancelling the chargeback. This is when they have agreed to waive the charge in writing! If I don't do this, then they will not release my developer's money and therefore my app. Call it a virtual human shield if you like..

My bank are useless to the point where I can't even claim my money back through services not received as there is no ""proof"" from Freelancer's website on a date of receipt of my product. 

This has dragged on and on for months to the point where I've given up hope of ever getting my money back or my app. I have had to lose the initial £212 chargeback by cancelling the investigation through my bank as I need my app. I have to take that on the chin. 

Problem is Freelancer now making demands about me providing documents that the chargeback has been cancelled when all they have to do is check their bank statement! Honestly, the nature of these people is INHUMAN.

You know what makes it worse? My app was aimed at helping disadvantaged children who are Dyslexic and Autistic but that doesn't matter to these bunch of crooks. They want their pound of flesh and few measly ill gotten dollars and they don't care if innocent children get caught in the crossfire. Collateral damage I believe they call it. I put all my savings into this project and unfortunately these children will never get to see this app which would have helped them and their families tremendously. When you have no mercy on innocent children then you really have lost all humanity. That is bad karma. It took me a year to save this money up only to lose it in an instant.. It doesn't help that my developer is a heartless b...ard who accuses ME of fraud. That hurts even more. 

I would love to take these people to court if I could afford it but being in the UK and them being Aussies, I have little chance of success. 

I will no doubt get the customary robotic ""customer service"" email on here for public show of course. Just to show the readers that they take this seriously when in fact they couldn't care less. 

So that's my story and all in all, it's a living nightmare. I just wish I never used them in the first place. I implore any readers, please don't use these criminals. They will rob you blind. I have to somehow come to terms with losing over £3000 which took me over a year to save up, bit by bit. 

All I have written is factual. If Freelancer want to dispute that, I am more than willing to show the public who is right and who is wrong. I have all the correspondence.

Good luck people and wish me luck too :(

UPDATE: Even after cancelling my chargeback to resolve this, these criminals demand letters which my bank simply cannot provide as it's not their policy.

When I have done the work then why freelancer refund employer's money. Well as I have got good experience so I bear the loss and started working again with new clients.

Last year again I get a client who need work in urgent for first task he paid me 300euro even the task was 70% completed. So I started live chat with freelancer support that I am in doubt this employer is a scammer and please review his account/identity etc etc. The support guy checked the account and confirmed me no issue and money is yours and you can withdraw the amount. Well I was keep working for him hard. Within 10 days he give me a lot of work for day and nights and paid me around 1600euro.

I have got the funds in my payoneer account and I have paid to designer but again same story after almost a month the client charge back and my account has gone into negative. I have worked on some other project almost $400 which freelancer deducted and remaining around -1220euro still in negative. BUT WHY CLIENT CAN CHARGE BACK IF HE GOT HIS WORK DONE ? WHY FREELANCER CAN'T GIVE PROOF TO HIS BANK ETC THAT HE PAID FOR THIS WORK OR WHY DON'T give any details to worker about the payment which employer used to scam ?

They did not fullfill this request for over a month (fully legit request according to T&C). On April 15th someone replied: ""However, user needs to request for refund while the contest is still open or within 30 days after the contest has ended. Hence, we cannot grant your refund request.""

I created the request after 14 days, well before the needed 30 days. Yet they still charged me and stole my money. Now they blocked my account and refuse to communicate.

The amount is now disputed on Paypal (PP-004-755-610-052) as well until you fullfill your part of the agreement according to your T&C.",1,“Scammers who will steal your money! Beware!”

No, it didn't happened, they send me a note after me asking them 10000 of times to give me the money back that they will close the ticket if I don't reply. 
My replies are there right on top of them and they just lazy, idiotic and thiefs keeping my money, charging me for fees and they never tell you. More fees that will appear taking your money from the account, and they make it very difficult for you to get you money back to your original payment method.

465,"Hi!

I'm Scammed by Freelancer for $4500 USD. I sent emails not less than 50 times for as long as 8 months and as always, I received auto-generated reply, stating that we'll get back to you within 48 hours and for Freelancer Team that 48 hours never come.

Whenever I tweeted on https://twitter.com/freelancer/with_replies immediately I received an auto-generated reply ""Hello, Let us discuss the details of your concern through DM. Thanks."" Once I let them know the issue, they say we've forwarded your issue to the concerned department and they will do the needful. Again I waited for months expecting a reply, but never received on twitter nor to our tickets. 

By fellow user, I learnt that there is an option for Live Chat. I tried contacting support team through Chat. The Support Executive name is Dave. S and he was very unprofessional, ethic-less, rude and *****. 

After a long chat which went for more than an hour, he had no answers for me and he said ""I'm disconnecting the Chat"" without providing any solution for the payment of $4500, which is Locked in my Freelancer account. 

As there was no option left for me, I tried to Contact CEO Matt Barrie regarding the issue. I never got any reply to my Tweets from him. When I sent few more tweets asking for help, he blocked me on Twitter page. This clearly shows that he is the main Culprit/ Fraud/ Criminal and encouraging his Fraud Team to scam more users from Worldwide. 

This is the time, I received a tweet from another user ""xyx"" (Not Real Name) saying even that Gentleman was scammed for $2000 USD and Freelancer Team had even Threatened and Harassed him for 6 Months, he sent me all the supporting documents related to Scam/ Harassment done by Freelancer Team. 

Few users who got scammed have done a really great job by Publishing all the details/ proofs on another Forum. You can fine all the details at this link: https://justiceforfreelancers.com 

Again I tried to contact Freelancer Support Team through Chat. As usual I didn't get any help despite having Chat for more than 30 Minutes. At last I was very much disturbed and I said ""Don't give me auto-generated Bull$#*! replies"", immediately the Support Executive said, I abused him and Closed my Freelancer Account and Scammed me for $4500 USD. 

After reading Reviews on this page, I sent email to all the Freelancer Team who has mentioned their email ids here. For reference: Lara (larao@freelancer.com) and few more. But never received any reply from anyone. 

Simply when you post a review here, they ask you to send an email or they will create a Ticket for you, to which they never reply. This is just an another way for fooling people.

Lets join together and save Millions of People from getting SCAMMED & HARASSED by Fraud FREELANCER. COM

So now we have decided to alert each and every user of Freelancer, Every Country Govt Agencies, Law Agencies, Courts, Media, Groups and lot more about the Scams and Harassment's done by Fraud Freelancer.com to the USERS

477,"So, I used the website based on a recommendation from a friend. First project, the Freelancer does not complete the project and disappears off the face of the earth (to be fair, she didn't claim her money either!!)
So, second time lucky? I post a second Project. The quality of the work was looking pretty poor and after the time period had elapsed to deliver the whole project and I hadn't even had the first part delivered, i was giving up hope. So what else could possibly go wrong?

So, I am checking my bank statement as I regularly do, only to find that Freelancer.com had decided to dip their thieving grubby hands into my credit card, not once.....but twice! Whats worse is that they had failed to credit my Freelancer account with the funds - 5 DAYS after the smash and grab!

I them spent 30 minutes trawling through their crappy website trying to find a customer service number and email address -(good luck with that by the way!) only to find that they have employed the CIA to ensure that none of their customers can ever find them.
I eventually find a template which a can submit to a literal black hole in India somewhere and Lo and behold.......Yep you guessed it! No one came back to me.

So, I called my Bank and disputed the two transactions. As soon as they had done than and quicker than you can say ""Thieving bunch of rats"" I receive a message on my Freelancer Profile telling me that My profile had been suspended until i informed them of why I dint think it was okay for them to debit money from my card without my permission! Also, I need to provide them with Passport and/or Drivers licence and Utility bill and/or bank statement (I was super comfortable with providing an already proven untrustworthy outfit with an identity scammers field day kit!).

But here's the thing. I hire this guy in Mexico who is working his butt off to deliver what I have asked him to do and frankly I honour my agreements. So i cobble together some information that satisfied their needs. A promise that 48 hours after submission of these documents, my account would be 

So I put money onto my account to pay him and waited 48 hours. Couldn't release. Wait 4 days. Still couldn't release. Now more than 5 days on. They are still 'reviewing' the documents i sent and not releasing the funds to the Freelancer.

THEY HAVE OF COURSE DEDUCTED THEIR POUND OF FLESH - RIGHT!!

SH*T REALLY does not get much worse than this! 

These guys are either completely inept, completely corrupt or completely both. Whatever the conclusion (and I have a very clear idea of where I think they sit) I would steer the hell away from these cowboys.

A great Idea and if it was being run out of London or Palo Alto then I would be 95% behind it.

God only knows who runs this outfit; 
Where they run it from; 
What they do with your credit card details; 
What they do with your personal data........

We must all be F*cking crazy (myself included) to be using this site  as we don't know the answer to any of the above questions!!!!!

So, in order to make it look like they really do exist and function as a company, they employ a monkey to respond to the appalling reviews they are getting. My particular chimp sent me a message saying that they are holding on to MY money for MY protection!!!

We Pal, I didn't have any issues through life......that is.....until I got involved wth your f*cking sh*t organisation. You are a bunch of crooks and need to be out of business!

I have checked your verification centre and you are still verifying the same documents more that a week late Sh*twad so what the f*ck was the point of your comment you silly c*nt!
And so it gets better. The pleading poverty criminal that I hired from the site was sending me daily communications about web development, telling me he needed to host the site on our domain. We of course refused as we didn't want an unauthorised site on our domain. So he changes approach. ""Okay, can I have access to your WordPress environment?"" Well sure you can........
""My user id does not work""
Yes it does....
""But I need access to to create a new database""
No, we will do that for you.....
""Okay, thanks""

Several days later, no website transfer, so we contact the guy and ask why......

""Nothing is working on your hosting platform sir""
Oh really......so we check access logs and see exactly what he has been doing and go back to him

""But what I really need is access to your CPanel Admin""
No, you can't have it.......

Several days later, still miss website, do we contact him again.
""Oh the site is finished and on your domain""
Oh really? Well we can't find it. Please send us a link.......

Several days later.......still no link, so we contact him again......
""We are having problems on your site so we have moved it back to our site.......here is the link""
The so called site was three pages so basic crap which was completely different and significantly worse than the previous rough drafts!!

We immediately remove his access from our site and lock him out. He was clearly only after our CPanel admin password.
So if you do choose to use this site......which I wouldn't if I were you, enter at your risk as both the site and the freelancers are dodgy!",1,“UNAUTHORISED CREDIT CARD DEBITS”

480,I am on site jabber.com and am reading one bad review after another about freelancer.com. I have tried getting work from that site for about a month and have seen my horrible experience over and over again on site jabber. Guess I should have looked here first! Especially since I am out $100. The worst part is that I received an email the other day asking me to vote for them to win an AWARD for being one of the BEST freelance sites out there. HOW is that POSSIBLE.,1,“Top 3 worst sites I've ever used” 
481,"UPDATE: As everyone can see, Freelancer has replied to my review on this website. My support tickets, however, still go unanswered, although the rep apparently had the time to check the ticket number and confirm that it exists. My ticket was submitted on the 30th of April, so that is almost 2 weeks now that I've been waiting for a reply. What else do you need to know of a company, other than that their representatives give more importance to replying to bad reviews on other websites, than actually taking care of customer service on their own website?

UPDATE 2:

After updating my review and sending a private message to the rep asking for them to actually look at my ticket, I received a reply - only to my original query. The CS rep that replied to me completely ignored my second message (and problem), and just marked my ticket as completed. I had to manually open it again to be able to reply to her and aks her to read my other messages as well! 

The word that comes to mind is ""underwhelmed"".

Original review:

I was awarded two projects on Freelancer.com during the same week - one for an hourly contract and one for a fixed-price contract. Having been burned by scammers previously, I was smart about my payments this time and had the client deposit the payment in as a milestone. I completed my work and sent the files to him, after which he gave me additional work. I was overjoyed! I created an invoice for the amount equal to the extra work and sent it to him, which he promptly paid. Much to both of our surprise, what happened is that the paid invoice absorbed the milestone into it, and only charged the client for the amount that went over what he had initially deposited. This made for a very uncomfortable moment when I had to ask the client to verify if this is what actually happened, and basically had to ask him to repay something we both had thought he had already put into escrow!

On an hourly contract, things got even more bizarre. I was hired for a very short job, so the client deposited only an hour's worth of money to give me a sense of security. I did the work using the time tracker (which is now required), and after completing my work - which took 1 hour and 42 minutes - I received an immediate automated e-mail telling me how many hours I had worked so far that week and what they were worth. The e-mail stated showed an accurate amount and also told me that an invoice would be automatically generated and sent to the client on this and this day. Alright, cool. Much to my surprise, however, the automatically created invoice did not actually bill the client according to my real-time worked hours (like it said in the e-mail), it had billed him a flat hour - even though my actual working time was written on the invoice, just like an afterthought. ""Worked hours 1.42, billed hours 1."" Why? The client's already paid my invoice and left me stellar feedback, so asking him to pay the rest is another awkward situation I really wish I didn't have to be in. On top of this all, I sent an e-mail to support about this over a week ago, and the only thing I've received back is ""we will be in touch in 24 hours""!

When you combine this with the fact that I keep getting invites to apply to jobs that specify a budget which is 1/3 of the rate written on my profile, the fact that Freelancer sends you tons of spam that clogs up your e-mail, and the fact that there is now a minimum charge for each project you are granted (which is charged immediately after you land the project, by the way - and thus forces you to require the client to release 10% of funds immediately just so your account doesn't go to minus from the project fee), making projects with a budget of under 50 dollars a complete waste of time when all things are considered, Freelancer has just become an absolute garbage website. I'm very disappointed.",1,"“Support non-existant, payment system incredibly confusing and filled with scammers!” "
482,"If you had high hopes to work as a freelancer via this platform. I must warn you about what will happen to you soon: 
- Complete project take money
- Try to transfer money from freelancer and it stalls and they always have some reason to hold your money on their pocket. 
- After sometime you will see that they will charge you back as much money as u earn.
- Or you complete a project and employer may disappear and without completing job. So you can not leave negative feedback to this

Posted a job, we had questions emailed, no response, they deducted the job $1526 from my credit card without allowing us to include an attachment. They now want more money to extend the job, however we still don't have an answer to our question which impacts the job.  I've lodged a complaint with my credit card provider in hope they will refund the money but 30days to wait.  I'm ashamed to say I've been scammed by a company who call themselves Freelancer.

Well, I completed my project ON FREELANCER, which means I need to be provided with the invoice BY THEM, I don't care whether it is Freelancer X, Y or Z I worked with. The platform is FREELANCER.COM and they still don't give me the invoice.
Terrible, terrible experience. Please stay away from them. That's all I can say.",1,“Do not trust them at all” 
488,"really rubbish service for both employers and freelancers. who even uses this company? surely there are better platforms like peopleperhour???

piece of advice to EMPLOYERS. If you have any issues where you have been ripped off unfairly by these clowns, then just request a chargeback with all your evidence to your bank/card provider. obviously this fine company will ban you but who cares. too many chargebacks on their account and their ability to process payments is null and void. don't get mad, just get even.

UPDATE: as you can see freelancer like to send public shows of ""customer service"" to keep up the facade that they care but in actuality, they take months to respond to concerns and even then it's still in the same arrogant and robotic manner. don't be duped. 

if you still decide to post a project on freelancer after reading hundreds of negative reviews then you deserve to lose your money. i like many learnt the hard way and i have lost everything thanks to these £$%^. i wish i had done my homework but it's a very harsh lesson learnt.",1,“avoid like the plague”

Employer is not willing to share these sensitive information. As Employer is not willing to share the above documents with freelancer.com, my all previous payments from this Employer are taken back by freelancer.com

When I contacted support, I told them why this is happening? They said, these kind of things are in their terms. After 2 hours, my account is suspended also.

490,"So, I really needed someone to proofread the translation work done by a Japanese translator, within 12 hours, one day and thought it would be a good idea to use this site. Biggest mistake.
The freelancer I chose was asmarjamshaid who I now know was an agent with few translators. He assured me the job will be done within the time by a native Japanese. I woke up next morning to a project submitted. Woohoo. well that joy only lasted for a min, as I read the text only to realise the proofreading done by this person was worse than Google Translate. 

I messaged him only to receive a reply insisting me that it was done by native. Regardless of whether it was completed by a native or not, the text was unusable. So I let him know of it, and submitted a negative review accordingly. He then sent me a number of threatening messages, including ""Go to hell"". 

I disputed the payment via Paypal to get my money back as I did not believe this freelancer did not deserve it, and also, I had to get someone else, and pay for the someone else to get it done. I then tried to close my account. But Now, Freelancer limited my membership. I just want it closed. 

Be aware, if you want to get your money worth, do not use this website.",1,“Horrible Freelancer!” 
491,"After spending over $40 on English tests on Freelancer to boost my ratings I was invited to apply for a job which I didn't feel qualified for. The only way I could see on the Freelancer site to contact the client was to accept the job and ask her more questions, as she was adamant that she wanted to hire me despite the fact that the job was for a VA position in the UK which paid $600 - and I live in CA, USA. Imagine my shock when $60 was immediately deducted from my PayPal account. When I contacted PayPal to dispute the charge, my Freelancer account was ""limited for security reasons"". Despite repeated emails over the past 10 days, I am still waiting for a refund. Trying to chat with the help desk just sends me back to the page telling me my account is limited. Per Freelancer instructions I cancelled the dispute with PayPal in order to get my money back. I did that. Still no response. So, between taking the tests and the $60 fee I am $100 out of pocket - which isn't as much as some Freelancers have lost - but it's a lot of money to me! Wish I'd checked out the reviews before I decided to use Freelancer. I worked on Elance for years without any problems whatsoever. I wish they were still around.
I forgot to mention that I declined the job but Freelancer still took their fee. For NOTHING!

UPDATE - on 4/6 I received a credit to PayPal for the full amount. I was thrilled, and ready to change the rating I'd given Freelancer.

However, today Freelancer has charged my PayPal account $10.48. I have NO idea what this is for as I only intended to use the Free membership on Freelancer. It seems that once this company has your PayPal details they just help themselves. I will be disputing the payment.

I feel that Freelancer is just too eager to take money for nothing - and I sympathize with those of you who've lost a lot of money by using the site. I have contacted PayPal who have blocked this company from taking any more money from my account, and who have refunded the $10.48 fee which I did NOT approve as a recurring payment.

Be warned",1,“Worst ever” 
493,When I received my first monthly report I actually checked all the directories that he claimed he submitted me too and none of them had my info. When I asked him to send me proof that he sumitted to directories he did not answer my emails or messages. A true scam artist stay away. I think his reviews are fake. I also asked Freelancer to help and they said that the only way is to ask for my money back from the programmer. Really?,1,“I hired seoleader1 on freelancer for SEO”

495,"Customers can only receive the service for which they pay (in my case through PayPal) once Freelancer.com has confirmed their e-mail. I attempted multiple times, in many different ways, to have them verify my e-mail but I only get auto-generated responses from their support team. I should also mention here that Freelancer.com has been sending  me multiple satisfaction surveys the e-mail I have on record with them, and have exhibited straight-out deceptive behavior when I brought the matter up with them on Twitter and via their support team. I have already verified my account via SMS (which does not seem to suffice for them, even as that is listed as one possible manner in which to verify your account). 

This all means I can't pay the freelancer who won my contest and Freelancer seems to pocket all the funds while pretending to address the issue on Twitter/e-mails/PayPal's resolution center and elsewhere. Recommendation to all employers: Stay away from these people.",1,"“Rip-off for employers, too” "
496,"Paid few usd for a logo design contest, I have never received the files, freelancer has disappeared and support wont refund the money. I have tried to open a Paypal dispute but the payment for freelancer.com is not covered by paypal protection service.

497,"In the term of one month I completed 5 projects, putting in 140 hours and actually getting paid (in theory) for one of those jobs.  Because of Freelancer's fee system, I actually lost several hundred dollars, charged to my credit card, in addition to 140 hours of free work.

Here is how it works:

1) A fraudulent employer, with no intention of ever paying posts a job.
2) That fraudulent employer hires one or more people to complete his project.
3) Freelancer charges you credit card based on the total price.
4) You complete the work, talk to the employer on a daily basis, and they give you lots of positive feedback that they love what you are doing.
5) You hit a Milestone, and the fraudulent employer tells you ""why don't we just finish this and I'll release the total amount"".
6) You complete the assignment.
7) The fraudulent employer disappears, no more conversations.
8) You file a dispute, which Freelancer ignores for as many as 10 days (that's my experience so far), I don't expect they will ever respond.
9) Freelancer claims no economic responsibility and still charges you based on the size of the fraudulent assignment.
10) Freelancer continues to ignore all of the fraud taking place, as long as they get their fees (which they pull from your credit card whether or not you ever get paid).

Bottom line is I feel entirely foolish for having logged onto this site.  PLEASE DO NOT follow my mistake.  It may seem appealing, work from home, work on your own schedule, do things that your good at, but it's all a giant fraud.

I am in the process of suing Freelancer, my attorney has requested their information, which is not available anywhere on the site (try to find an address, phone number or even their country, which is Australia).  My lawyer has suggested that they are like to not give us this information, which means we will need to seek a summons through the Australian justice system.

If anyone out there want's to join a class action suit, I am prepared to fund it's start, and my attorney is prepared to process it.

So, this is not a ""OK"" for this site this is a ""THIS SITE SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN"".

Anyone interested in joining a class action (it costs you nothing) should contact me at:

I will forward your information to the attorney, he may contact you for a brief interview, but again, you have nothing to lose, and hopefully we can close these f%^&ers down.

498,This site has no protection for the freelancer. All disputes are automatically resolved in favor of the employer. When the project was 100% finished by me according to initial buyer requirements project was marked as unsatisfactory and closed without any explanation. When I contacted to the support they told me that I should myself resolve all the issues with the client. In addition they took out money from my account.,1,“Stay away from this site!” 
499,"After signing upto this site, I thought I'd be in a great position to make some more money by finding more jobs. 

Having a great experience with upwork (oDesk) i needed to widen my project range, so i came across the 'number one platform for freelancers'.

After signing up i was told that im best having some qualification behind me by doing a exam. 
After doing them on odesk for free, i was surprised to see they were charging for them, but that didn't bother me, i did a test and passed and got my badge. I tried another one but didn't pass, to resit the test they wanted another $8, so i forgot about it. 

After applying to jobs with the ferocious competition, i finally got offered a job which i gladly took. 
Getting ready to pay my rent for the week, i was shocked when my bank told me i didn't have enough funds in my account. I checked to find that freelancer had directly removed the fee for the job from my account, when i hadn't even started working on it. 
I contacted support to find out that they take the fee from the freelancer directly instead of from the funds that they had already acquired from the employer. This is probably so they always get their cut If the payment is unauthorized (take from the little guy, trust). This was something i had never experienced from a freelancing website, but i was shocked when i read the support email where the member has said ""This is not refundable if the project isn't successful"" (yeah, typical).

I still kept using the site in order to get the money i could from this job (didn't have a choice now).
After completing, the employer released the funds which i went to withdraw. 
The first thing i noticed is that they had their own exchange rates. 
(Losing $13 from the current exchange rate)
And they are also making me wait half a month before they even consider releasing my funds because of ""security reasons"".
Talk about a disaster. (Considering they are so fast when it comes to taking money from me) 

Freelancer.com is the most money-hungry, pathetic site i have ever used to find work. Peroid.

I wish i did product review search before I used them. Im $921 out of pocket for nothing in return. Their support is the worst in the world. No telephone support like other companies and terrible email support and response times.

Here is my story. I hired a contractor to do some website work after paying one of freelancers staff a fee of $32 fee to recommend the best freelancer for the job. I interviewed the contractor they recommended, I awarded the job to him and we agreed on a timeframe to complete the work. I then paid $800 for the job plus other admin fees $27 & $18 to Freelancer . Once I had paid freelancer the funds,  the contractor then said he was going on holidays and would not be free much to do the work. We clearly discussed the time frame and he assured me he was available to complete the job. But then as soon as the job was awarded and moneys transfer to Freelancer the contractor told me he is now not available much to do the work.
I needed to get the job done and decided to get somebody else to do the work from a different agency. The contractor demanded he gets paid $100. Basically for just the job interview. No work had started or documents were provided to the contractor. I told him its ridiculous you wanted to get paid for  briefly discussing the job over skype, but he demanded to get paid $100 for the job interview. I contacted Freelancer support and they told me there was an arbitration process that had to be followed. So I did that and paid another $42. The contractor backed down and I was won the dispute. They still will not release my money back to me even though i clearly won and no work has even started.

Freelancer has now frozen my funds and mentioned in the notes that this matter will be resolved in 64 days. 64 days my friends, can you believe it 64 days.(Note I can still deposit more money though) They has asked me to supply my passport , rates notices and other proof of id. I thought this was ridiculous but as this was not need in the beginning but did as they requested. Absolutely made no  difference. Their poor support has disappeared.

here is the complete CASE i forward to freelancer

I have been a member of freelancer.com since 2010 with approx 298, 5 star reviews and a valuable assest to freelancer. Due to some misunderstanding (and issues created by a client), my account was closed without any explanation asked from me. I still have no clue as to what client told freelancer team and why I was not contacted before taking such extreme measures. You can ask my other clients for my work ethics and behaviour as well as quality of work or I can gladly request them to provide testimonials from me, if my past reputation is not enough.
I would request freelancer to be considerate and reinstate my account please. If any terms are breached, I would gladly like to know and rectify and avoid in future so it doesn't happen again. I think everyone deserves a second chance please. At least if you can tell me, I assure you any such thing would not happen ever again. This is my humble request to freelancer and your consideration will be greatly appreciated.
I would also like to mention few noteworthy points:
1) I was never given a chance for explanation and whatever client told freelancer it was believed immediately. The only explanation I got was ""substantial proof"" of threatening client. To account for this, I provided the proof of his conversation (which i am attaching again). This evidence clearly shows how cunning this person is that he first threatened me and then approx 20 min later deleted his own conversation to remove any traces. Lord knows what else he manipulated to provide as a proof to freelancer which I am unaware of and freelancer believed him. While I was sending proof, freelancer had already closed my account. I understand behaviours are not tolerated, then how can this (attachement) was tolerated and why I was the victim of this?
2) I had also attached backup of the work done [#NJN-767-10444]. If I had taken the site down, why would I be willing to share and restore the site? Also, considering how this client mind is, he would be very well aware that a site can be easily restored by resetting the server/hosting to its previous state.
3) I agreed to proposed solution byfreelancer.com [#NJN-767-10444] i.e. to restore the site as well as stop from communicating with client, yet my account was closed half hour later. Could you please explain this? I was willing to resolve this matter. Also, he had changed his cpanel access, ftp logins so I couldn't access the backend.
4) I have been on freelancer for a long time now with high reputation and I know the rules. If by any chance I have unintentionally breached the terms, please forgive and point out so that I can rectify my mistake and avoid it in the future. I am a human after all and deserve a 2nd chance. 
5) You can check my past history and see for yourself that I provide quality, yet professional work.

THE LAWYER AND SUING THEM IS NEXT STEP FOR ME!  I JUST WANT MY MONEY BACK!  I joined Freelancer in the hope that I would get some half decent work to do.  Umm NOT!!!  of the few jobs that i was asked about i accepted only one and with that the people that hired me to build them an art website were working with stolen art and stolen credit card numbers and i got ripped of $500.00 through my personal square account, i have reported all this to the police.  These people that are posting these jobs are from Nigeria and i recommend for those of you that wish to continue with Freelancer.com never accept or bid on a job from anyone from Nigeria they are all scam artists.  They have now stolen my artwork and are trying to sell it online and Freelancer.com continues to let these employers post this job about this art gallery assistant being needed pathetic i can't believe it.  I am so infuriated.  I put in another support ticket today because i was contacted by another person again yesterday in where these people were scamming her with my art work this is not funny and freelancer does not absolutely nothing to resolve this dispute.  These employers on there don't put up profile pictures, they don't have to supply copies of government id and taxation information in order to prove they are who they say they are....like just disgusting.  I do not recommend people use the freelancer.com site.  In my opinion Freelancer.com has also stolen my artwork because they are allowing these people to continue to fraudulently post these jobs to sell it.",1,“ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT!!!”

Today I found my account suspended after I have received the money from my employer. I have received an email telling me that the money was successful released. But when I logged to my account I was checked how I was suspended for login to my account; telling me that I have broken its rules. 
Wake up freelancer! wake up employers! dont waste you time!
One day you will be checked like me. I was already warned by many friends but I could not take that in consideration. But with the first time with a project with good budget, I got deceived by this scammer website. 
They know everything about you, once they feel that they want take your money and get ride of you, they will do that without hesitation or a pre-warning! 

Don""t use their desktop App, it records everything on your computer to help them spy on you if you have some trouble with them. I mean, this App is a spyware!!!!!! 

Freelancer is losing its business. Its situation is going worst everyday. They make up new scamming rules everyday to control their users money. They will use any scamming, hacking or every legal power to take rid of you. Be aware!!!!

521,"Our company has used outsourcing systems for nearly 15 years now. Freelancer appears polished and cutting edge on the surface, but what stirs below is unacceptable. We went through a number of highly rated India developers, who in turn trashed our CMS system. We have since hired professional and skilled developers outside of Freelancer who are not false in describing their skillsets. Sadly, many of the developers on Freelance promise great results, but are less than acceptable. Freelancer attracts the undersided dark realm of developers, many who are dishonest, who claim templates and other projects as their own, who inflate their time on per hour projects excessively. India and Pakistan for example, is rife with these type of developers. Developers will often start with energy, but if the project become complicated, they lay it aside for easier projects won, and weeks later you find yourself listing in the sea of no progress.  India developers for one will back away from a project whose manager knows that time is being padded and refuses to accept time extortion and poor results. Freelancer has no effective means of accountability, where project abuse is frequent and not policed properly.   Additionally, the system is setup as such as a person is extorted to leave a good review to remain a valid user of the system, where a developers rating often should have been one star. We learned the hard way to not add a credit card or Paypal account for Freelancer access. The process provides no confirmation window during the acceptance of a candidate, where suddenly you find a large fee has been deducted from your funding source as payment for all the milestones, held in the Freelance system without reprieve.  Paypal assisted me by reversing the fees by force reversal due to my long history with them and due to the poor reputation of Freelancer, but Freelancer stated it would not reverse the unapproved deduction from my Paypal account. However later Freelancer claimed they kindly refunded my funding, but they actually did nothing but refused to assist. Flee from Freelancer, at great speed to preserve your funds and sanity.",1,“Nice System But Unethical In So Many Ways” 
522,"Hello,

I'd like to get started by sharing my story and how no one in freelancer takes any responsibility for what goes on with employees. 
I had a website that needed to be fixed and a freelancer by the name Technospike (DO NOT HIRE) was supposed to fix my page and other tasks that were included in a word document. 

Once the freelancer accepted, after 10 minutes she sent in a new milestone request asking for another $100 (Initial project was $100) without even doing ANYTHING. In the document sent it was clearly stated what needed to be completed and no money until completion. 

She accepted the job and advised 3 Days, almost 2 weeks later she broke my website, broke all formatting and still was asking for MONEY even though she screwed up big time, so I asked to kindly fix and then she tried to trick me into removing the project so she would not get a bad review then she would release the money.

Now I am in a situation where SUPPORT is simply ridiculous. They only provide chat support which is very funny for the amounts of money they handle and the more I find out and read I am starting to think that they even set up fake profiles to trick people into paying. 

At this moment I don't think I will recover the money at all as they tell me that only the freelancer can release the funds (VERY STUPID DECISION) since I could create fake profiles and start tricking people into it. 

If you love your company and time, PLEASE AVOID THIS SCAM. If it is to good to be true it probably isn't. If I receive my money back I will update, also let's not forget that I GOT CHARGED 5 DOLLARS TO CREATE THE PROJECT AND REMOVE IT BUT YET AGAIN THEY ARE GOOD TO RECEIVE THE MONEY BUT NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS AND SUPPORT. 

COMPANIES LIKE THIS NEED TO DISAPPEAR, SIMPLY DISGUSTING AND TIME CONSUMING.

UPDATE:

Hello everyone, 

I wanted to update my review as things are getting more complicated with this company and It seems that I will never get my money back. I have reached out to their support department more than 5 times now and it has been over a month and still no responses. I wanted to show the kind of GARBAGE I have to put up with and their horrible support team who simply stopped responding, see below and please do yourself a favour! DO NOT USE THIS SCAM WEBSITE, YOU WILL GET ROBBED AND NO ONE WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR SERVICES

523,"Hi 

my account on freelancer.com was closed by site admins. the reason they gave after i submitted a support ticket was that i violated one of their terms :s

they would not tell me what it was.

i had just the day before given a project to a freelancer, and had deposited money on the account as milestones, this was a total of just over £500.

after speaking to the live help desk they firstly would not give me any information, just kept saying the account has been closed we cannot give any information.

i then spoke to another help desk advisor, who said he would escalate my issue to the 2nd line support, asked me to send an email to their support desk to open a ticket, which i did.
he said to wait for a reply.

has any one ever been in my position, where the account was closed with money init?
did you get your money back?

honestly feel robbed by the website, as i have done nothing wrong.

the lack of communication from them is very frustrating as well.

----------------
10/03/2016

This has now been resolved, the payment was not clearing for what ever reason, therefore my bank cancelled the transaction.

There was very little communication from freelancer.com, regarding the reason of cancelling my account, or what was happening with my money.

They did not even care about how much stress i was going through about the possibility of loosing my hard earned money, as i had done nothing wrong.

There online support are useless, they do not give you any information or help. at one point the online chat was terminated by one of their workers, because i was not accepting that they could not escalate the issue to someone higher than them.

I personally will never be using the website again, and i advise any one who is thinking of using it NOT TO!!!!!",1,“Account closed by admins with over £500 in it”

We were told that the company on freelancer who hired us had an account restriction and the we had to wait for the money. Well it has been over 9 months now and we keep getting told the same thing we have to wait. It is a such a scam. Please do not use them - they are not located in the US their is no regulations they have to follow. They don't post a phone on the site which is in violation of Google's policy. You can not speak to manager. They take weeks to get back to you and say the same thing over and over again without responding to your request. You will lose your money.

I can just see them now, sitting on their butts, coming up with ways, not to enhance the community, but to take peoples money. I bet they even thought of ways to make you pay just to read their site but reconsidered on the chance we may not go for that. Maybe theyll rethink it and introduce it somewhere down the line.
I created a dispute and still waiting for my money. I created two milestones but changed my mind and yep, still waiting for my money. Oh, you want to take it to the next level? That will cost you money.
I have come to grips with the realization that I wont get my money back. So, its ok. Go have a late on me.

The unsuspecting users mostly the freshers are the major victims in this regard. Scammers make them bid for those fake projects, (which are being posted almost every 20 seconds) and make them to work without doing the milestone and run away after the worker has delivered the job. One can authoritatively say that the scenario is such that 7 out of every 10 jobs being posted are scams. I have written to the Customer Support on several occasions to report this ugly development; I even suggested to them that they should introduce a policy where users will be charged certain fee to post projects. I told them that this will go a long way to curtail the menace as it will help in chasing some of these obstreperous users away. But it seems that the Freelancer.com team never valued my suggestion. Now, the situation has gotten out of hand and I'm afraid, because this is not a good sign for the company; only if the management of the company realise the implication of this problem.

Tried a ""free trial"" of their Plus Membership as a newbie to the site only to have them charge my account after a month without any notice or reminder that the trial was about to end. I was unable to use the account very much and didn't agree to this auto-enrollment to the Plus Membership. 

After a few emails back and forth with their customer service, they have now stopped responding to my emails and are not giving me any updates on my concern.

547,"Freelancer just emptied the money from my account, just because the guy who gave me the project did not complete his verification. I am with freelancer for more than 7 years. I told them, it is his freewill I really can not interfere with other peoples freewill. What benefit he has to complete the verification process?  

I completed my verification process by providing all my ids faithfully. But asking other people to submit their id is not really with in my control. If freelancer want this kind of verification to be done, then they have to make the verification to be completed before accepting money from the client. 

I trusted Freelancer and I released my work to him. Where is the security for my work that was delivered to him? I am just small people working hard and making just small wages like few hundred dollars. And Freelancer is literally treating their members like as if they are part of a terrorist organization or something. There is a limit to police the activities on the website, this seems like too extreme. I did all the things they asked me to do and submitted every document they requested, regardless of that they want to reverse my hard earned money. 

I would really recommend them to work for CIA or FBI , they are more suitable for that kind of job, they do not know how to care for the hard work their members did.  

Why I am being the middle man between Freelancer and the guy who gave me the project to ask him submit their documents for the project that was completed and closed? I really pitty the people who have suffered similar fate like me. 

I would really recommend people to move away from this site slowly, even there are many other similar sites who take higher margin, but it is more safer platform than Freelancer. What is the point  can you imagine you are with them for 7 years, and suddenly just because of one issue they take away your money or block the account? Especially when we have so many customers and reputation, all these takes years to build, which they can just simply block with one click? No one should be in such a dire situation.  

Just because of their own incapacity to make others complete the verification process, they just wiped my money from my account. Does anyone see any humanity in such a thing? I can only see a monstrous attitude with absolutely no care.

STAY AWAY from this site, dont even waste a second anymore on this site.

Another craziest thing was, they also ask me to pay back the money for the project that was completed long ago and successfully completed. I told Freelancer clearly, that the previous money you wiped out from my account was not at all refund to the client. So please send me the proof that this has been done and he really received the money. 

And they did not even willing to answer my question and started repeating the message like, please deposit money, please deposit money. Then it strikes me, why they are not answering my questions and keep repeating, maybe I am talking to a chatter bot. All the while i thought I was talking to a real human being who has same emotions and feelings like me. 

By repeating what it can achieve? Or by avoiding not answering my question if it thinks, it can achieve anything let it keep thinking that. No smart person will think, by repeating same question again and again he can achieve anything. This is really a dumb bot. 
So either Freelancer is having chatter bot to resolve customer support issues, or maybe they put people from junior high school as their support staff. No mature person will avoid answering a question.

Apart from the above funny bot issue, my question is what happened to the money they wiped from my account ? It is not in my account, my client also did not receive it. So where it went?  I am sure any body can make some educated guess on that.",1,“Stealing Money and Support looks like an automated bot reply”

559,"Freelancer doesn't care about its customers/employees. At all. While the ability to easily access and bid on freelance work sounds extremely appealing (and IS, when executed properly), this company fell short in EVERY POSSIBLE way and experience. 

Freelancer does nothing to verify the authenticity of employers who are looking for freelancers. They do not require you verify payment methods (like connecting a bank account or credit card) before posting jobs for freelancers. They do not require you verify your email or name either. I was completely scammed on a writing job and Freelancer said that it isn't their ""job"" to protect the freelancers, verify job authenticity, nor hold the employer accountable. Actually YES, that is exactly the point of the site. Otherwise, I'd go to craigslist.

Freelancer had NO problem charging me a fee for helping me to ""find work,"" but when the employer scammed me out of hundreds of dollars, and just never paid, they made me fight tooth an nail for weeks to get a refund on the fee - which was more than reasonable to have since they DIDN'T actually assist in me working a legitimate project. I with NEVER work with anyone from Freelancer again, and I have already warned everyone I know about this terrible experience.

Protect your freelancers and employers. Require verified payment methods on BOTH sides before any party can post a project or accept work. When someone posts a project and accepts a freelancer's bid, hold the agreed upon cost until the job is submitted to the employer. This isn't rocket science. The point of your site is to make people feel safe, not scammed by the employer and then scammed again by you. So disappointing.

**Update** Yes. My issue with the fee reimbursement is NOW taken care of through chat. It should not take that many attempts. It shouldn't be charged until the freelancer is paid. It should not take a representative saying ""it appears we've already refunded you"" when he actually refunded me right then and there (as I was literally looking at the balance at the top of the screen) - it also has a date stamp next to the refund... I can see when it happened and that he did it while we were talking. Even then, he couldn't just say ""I'm so sorry; let me take care of that for you. He had to just pretend it already happened.

 Hope you're doing well.

 understand your concern with regard to the reversed payment from your account. Our records show that your employer had issues with their account which was subsequently closed. Note that payments originating from an account which has issues will be reversed immediately for security reasons. The reason why the payments you've received from your employer were reversed is because we are avoiding you to be involved into any potential issues since that payment is questionable. Such actions are outlined on section 19 of our Terms and Conditions which you agreed when you joined our site: https://www.freelancer.com/about/terms

 As much as we would like to help you recover the funds, it was reversed and returned to its original funding source and is no longer on the site. It may be returned to you by directly contacting your employers ""maikatitu"" and ""ludihora"" and ask them to settle the payment offsite.

 Again, we apologize for what happened to your projects and payments. These security protocols were created with the best of intentions. We're just sorry that you were inconvenienced by them.

 Thanks for your understanding and take care.

How am supposed to contact the employer as he is no longer available in the site? Help me pls",1,“I lost 600$” 
563,"To cut a long story short I've been scammed many times on Freelancer at least five times in eighteen months. They don't care well I suppose if you had over 17 million subscribers why should they?

If you pay for a service you expect some support. They never respond to emails and when they do it's always read the terms and conditions in Section 19 they take no responsibility. They are just a bunch of mindless drones with little personality, poor direction and minimal common sense. 

I did not sign up to be scammed nor did I sign up to work for nothing. The problem lies with their methods and the policies they hide behind. Those at director level must lead a very comfortable lifestyle. Why not take the fees and tell the Freelancer that they won't be paid as the money used comes from a ""questionable"" source. Then refund the PM the money they paid for offering the project keeps everyone happy apart from the Freelancers who have paid a fee to deliver a project then find they finish out of pocket. This equates to theft and taking money under false pretences. All you get when you complain is refer to section 19 which basically deflects any responsibility from Freelancer. They basically encourage fraudulent practices

How is the Freelancer suppose to check each project and ensure that the funds aren't coming from an untrustworthy source? We aren't mind readers nor is the project likely to be from a business down the road which you may already have knowledge of so you might know? You have to accept the project is genuine and you will be paid. There is always the risk that you won't unlike Freelancer who are guaranteed to be paid for every job!

They also cancelled a transaction for £220 for work I did for a PM one day. I provided the service they advised the payment was suspect and reversed it. Consequently I did work for nothing. They advised they tried to contact the PM but of course he was long gone as he got something for nothing. I also had to pay fees for work I delivered by accepting the project Freelancer apparently encourage and openly condone the posting of scam projects. When I have reported scam projects the adverts have been removed then resubmitted several days later I have evidence of this.

I've filed court proceedings against Freelancer to recover the £220 but I won't hold my breath they must have loads of them to work through mine will be at the bottom of the pile!

In the meantime they say I owe them $117 for fees accrued from work I never undertook. More chance of them seeing that than me walking around the supermarket and bumping into Elvis Presley by the pizza counter. 

You stand your ground and fight your corner and they take exception. I then opened a new account to circumnavigate the issue. Made a business contact who was happy to employ me and they decided to close the account as a duplicate. More revenue lost there and a guy who must think I'm an ungrateful cretin. Thanks a bunch Freelancer 

You have been warned steer clear it will cost you money and your reputation.

As you can see from the Freelancer response more swerving the subject and trying to placate and diffuse the situation by trying to convey the impression they actually care Freelancer have screwed me over twice in their efforts to protect the community not to mention the money I have lost due to being scammed by scammers on the Freelancer site. 

All empty words as usual I'm afraid and empty words tend to fall on deaf ears.

Don't use Freelancer It's a pity I can't close my account as I supposedly owe them money for fees for work I never got otherwise I'd do it tomorrow!

Update 16/07/2016

Well we are over seven months since I took legal action to recover my monies and as I write I've still not heard anything. The crooks haven't even had the decency to acknowledge my claim so this shows what a corrupt operation they run. So if you can't beat them then they expect you to join them?

I guess until they wake up and smell the coffee all I can do is keep posting on here and reminding other Freelancers what a shower of sh1t Freelancer are and would advise sensible people to keep well away.

Over 1,000 reviews on here and 850 negatives lol

The only way to deal with this people is to vote with your feet and cancel your membership and don't pay any fees or take any of their pointless tests. If people as one unite disappear then their money will soon dry up. We are all to blame by keeping this sinking vessel afloat

If they were in the US or UK they would have been shut down years ago but because they flout the system by having a virtual/correspondence address in Australia and rent an office in the Philippines they don't come under any scrutiny.

Anyway that's me done for today's moan life is too short to think about these vvankers got to make money elsewhere

Update 14/08/2016

After a long legal and email battle Freelancer have finally reinstated my account and waived all fees. I've lost my £220 as they won't budge on the apparent fraudulent payment as it implicates them but its a start.

I kept asking to speak to their CEO who for some reason was never available? In the end determination and wanting to clear my name got me there and the fact they couldn't be bothered to argue with me anymore. Don't know if I'll be bothered to actually bid again on anything as I can't be going through this rigmarole every time I accept a project.

16 months to resolve something which should have been resolved in a matter of days.

As a footnote I notice that the more recent reviews are all of a sudden favourable after 870 out of 1050 negative reviews? Now I would never insinuate foul play or of course question genuine feedback but it does seem odd that Freelancer(s) have all of a sudden started heaping praise on a business that clearly fails on business ethics and chooses to operate in an apparent scattergun manner with little sympathy to the freelancers who pay to use their services

So either Freelancer have significantly changed their business model for the better (yeah right!) which lets face it wouldn't be difficult or maybe just maybe have recruited people to write favourable reviews to boost their ratings?

""John eat 2 pieces of apples a day. Now, is Thursday, but he remembered the his apples left after eating apples during Monday are 30 pieces after that, he gave the half of all his apples to her daughter. How many apples left, if today is Friday after eating the two pieces of apples?""

At least three other questions on the test had issues, such as multiple correct answers or no correct answer.  Needless to say, this is completely unprofessional, especially considering these are paid tests.  How can I showcase my skills to prospective clients with a test like this?  After the test was completed, there was an option to add more questions to the test.  It looks like they don't even verify new questions for accuracy.

Having a very specific focus and skill set within a small, well connected industry, I came to learn that someone I knew through my professional network had had begun a project and was in search of contractors.  I searched through numerous other websites until I discovered that they had posted about the project here.

Despite their own TOS and UA forms stating otherwise, I was told that anyone with a pre-existing connection cannot perform business on their platform--though I have not had any contact with the buyer in years (having met more than a decade ago).  I have since contacted the buyer directly, and we will no longer be using Freelancer for the entirety of the project.

Hi! I want to share my experience about Freelancer.com. First thing I can say  I was very dissapointed. First thing you have to do when you come to this platform  you need to register and to provide information about your credit card for ""verification of your identity"". Ok...Then you start to bid, then you find that most of the projects there are fake and there's no guarantee that you will be payed for your job  as for me  I've made a work for one project, and then employee just stopped answering me, so I remained not payed for my job, and my appeals to the support team of Freelancer.com didn't help. At the same time for this project Freelancer.com charged me (from my credit card) with 5 euro. So the fees they are taking for projects don't mean that they gonna protect you in any way. Then appeared one strange project created specially for me with name ""project for rafaellaburtman"" - this project was prorosed to me and awarded to me and inspite that I didn't accept this project Freelancer.com took from me the fee in amount 15.38 euro from my credit card without my agreement. Much time passed and I still didn't get my money back. 

Conclusion: when you try to work on Freelancer.com you lose money, but not gain. I've lost 20 euro while just trying to find a job there  so my advice to all Freelancers is to find another source and not to be a victim of frauders.",1,“Be careful! Fraud! Don't use the services of Freelancer.com!”

Now here is my review:
I was grossly misinformed by freelancer support staff 3 times, which led me to pay $161 for a design that I didn't authorise. I told customer support staff that I would file a claim with paypal to get my money back, and they said ""we don't advise doing this because it will cause an account issue"".  I filed a claim anyway, because that is coersion!  And now feelancer are saying that my account is in a NEGATIVE balance of $161, and they have not paid any money to paypal.  I am waiting for paypal to resolve this issue.  I recommend steering clear of this site, it is very very dodgy.

Update: They have responded saying: Hi, Emma. Your account shows that you are currently having issues with regard to the deposits that you made. We strongly recommend you to do two things for this issue to be resolved: 1) Kindly refer to the Verification Center for further updates and/or instructions from our Support; 2) To coordinate with PayPal with regard to the deposit/s. We would like to assure you that we will assist you with your concern until your account issue is resolved. Thank you for your cooperation. Take care.

Firstly, their verification centre rejected my verification and CONTINUES to hold onto my money.  I have sent so so many emails that have not been responded to - this is the first response via this website.  Of course they will try to save face, but read all the other HUNDREDS of reviews on sitejabber.com for other people who have been scammed.  It is beyond a joke.  Let's all join together and get this site CLOSED DOWN once and for all!!!",1,“Scammers running a fraudulent operation - stay away” 
585,"Lost $1500. First programmer I awarded project didn't respond in 3 days. So i unawares him and awarded another the same project.

All freelancer does is encourage you and freelancer to communicate, which is only messaging. But t seems Freelancer can not see any of the message chains nor ""the work"" submitted.  Then when i deleted the other awarded same ""make cell phone app"" awarded to other guy that never respond - it also deleted current awarded freelancer that was paid $1500.  Now case is closed and can't even rate the rip off freelancer!  This is an excellent place to spend your time and money to get ripped off, pissed off, and waist a tonn of time trying - wishing to get resolution. - you'll never get your work done here! They have no way and no concern to get scammers off of their website. Their set up encourages and promotes them. no real resolution evaluation system. Only so long as freelancer is communication - sending ANY message to me and ANY ...""Work""... (including a screen shot - i think ""work is any picture file"") then the freelancer is meeting criteria of ""actively communicating with employer"" - Regardless of what communications or ""work"" that is being done!

I was charged $9.99 per month for no reason AND 3 months later was notified by freelancer that they never received the money I paid them ""Verification reasons"". I had to open a dispute and pay the freelancer through paypal.

That I was running 3 accounts under 1 user. And it's not true. We were actually 3 persons and each of us had account.

I opened a criminal inquiry on this scam artist extraordinaire.  Doubt that it will do much before my bank charges them back.  But at least the authorities are now aware of their little hole in the wall scam.

We used to pay our freelancers through Elance.  But after they shut down, we thought we'd try another platform... Freelancer.com.  WHAT A MISTAKE!  We had our guys set up accounts.  And then we transferred 967.00 to two providers.  The first payment was 18 days ago.  My provider said they had to verify the payment with us.  They didn't send any type of notification.  They just 'seized' his funds.  So we reached out to Freelancer... no response.  Again... no response.  Opened a Paypal dispute.  

And all of the sudden there is a response.  They want to 'verify' the transaction.  They called from a restricted number, refused to provide a call back number stating their entire company runs off of Skype Business.  (BS.  They are just masking the fact that they are located in one of the scam capitols of the world... the Phillipines.)  So they said they were going to release the funds.  We told them when they did that we would drop the dispute.  

Next we get an email saying we have to close the dispute before the release the funds.  (BS)  If we do that and they do not release the funds to the provider, we cannot reopen the dispute.  So now we have had to escalate the dispute to a full blown Paypal case because these extortion artists like to steal peoples' money according to my experience and others on this board.

Believe this.  All freelance boards are NOT created equal.  These guys are like little league vs. the majors.   Their customer service sucks.  The average provider on this board sucks.  And they are thieves.  Stay away.

I am owed $370 over the three projects that haven't been paid.  For the one where the client owes me $300, the client was responsive at first but now doesn't respond to my messages, even though I can see she has been online every day.  The second on is Indian or Pakistani, and he even went so far as to mock me when I said I would open a ticket with support.  He keeps putting me off, saying ""give me a few more days"".

I've opened a ticket for the one that owes me $300 (or thereabouts) and it appears the client isn't even responding to Freelancer.com now.  Yet she had 29 projects open (so I dread to think how many other people she has scammed, if she even is a she).  It's gone to the tier 2 support team but they don't seem to be doing much about it.  

I opened a ticket the other day for the guy that owes me $70 and it looks like they are looking into this, but the guy clearly knows how to play the system and it looks like I've been scammed by two different people on the site and Freelancer are happy to take my money every month for my subscription but offer no protection. And the three jobs where I didn't get paid were all done through their hourly time tracker as well, so it should have been more protected.

Not impressed at all with them.  I think they're out to make as much money as possible off people and don't care about the freelancers at all - even though we pay for everything we do on their site.  I'm so tired and annoyed with this and just want to be paid fairly for the jobs I did.  If I could give them no stars, I would.

END UPDATE:

I can't even wipe my ass in the morning with 255 letters.

After 5 years of relative satisfaction, I'm outta here.  I've already for the last couple months been with guru.com and upwork.com.  much nicer website, people that post projects are genuinely looking for real developers, etc.

C-ya !!

UPDATE: 4/27/2016

Well.......  Here it is 5 months later with UPWORK.com which has a very nice web design and interface, easily create custom savable searches, etc..  But it has been a complete disaster.  Let me explain.

In the last several months, new upwork project submissions seem to have come to a trickle.  When I first migrated to upwork, and created my custom searches that contain things such as socket programming, TCP/IP, multi-threaded programming, Raspberry PI, Networking, Software Licensing, etc... The things I am best at, there was a good flow of new projects on a daily basis.

In the last 2 months, I have not had a single project awarded to me.  Because there just haven't been that many submissions to bid on.

In the end, I bit my tongue today and had freelancer.com reinstate my cancelled account, so I can get back to work and have cash flow again.

Sorry, freelancer.com for the negative comment last Thanksgiving, but until you drive that other car for awhile, you really don't know how dependable your existing car really is.

It is good to be back.

Additionally, I found the bid amounts they were asking for to be almost demeaning. $2 an hour for graphic design work? Is that even legal?",1,“Extremely Shady Business”

I signed up for the low level free account, because well - why not? After I failed after THREE attempts at their ridiculous verification process, I smelled a rat. They wanted ""clear, unaltered photos"" (done), a government-issued ID (done), and a recent utility bill, phone bill etc. to show true residency (done). Fine. I did all that. After a week or so, they told me that they couldn't verify me, but I'd passed two of their three checks.

Once you're in, the fine print says you have the option of paying them an extra monthly fee (at various membership levels) to increase your visibility. Oh, and every bid will cost you 3% or $3 USD, whichever is greater, which is actually not bad. Some sites I've seen charge as much as 20% for each bid you deliver on.

Then the real smell of rat emerged when I saw them asking me to take a ""mandatory choice"" of numeracy, literacy, or logic, each costing $5 -- otherwise my ""profile would be incomplete"". So in other words, I need to pay them first in order for them to potentially pay me, *IF* I won a bid for a job (yes, like many other freelancing sites, it's bid-based, like an eBay for jobs.) No thank you. That's not how I do business, and I refuse to ""pay to play"".

EDITED UPDATE (In response to the feedback below)
Hello Freelancer Rep, thank you for your response to my feedback. I found my overall experience (beyond the initial hopes that this would be a suitable source for legit freelance jobs, as indicated above) to be quite bad, I'm afraid. I'll accept that verification may be required for certain types of employers, for tax purposes or other business reasons, but as for ""skill tests"", I can only say that 1) your process needs vast efficiency improvements, and 2) freelancers should emphatically *NOT* be the ones paying for these proficiency tests. Their skills and abilities should be self-evident from both their profiles, as well as the bid proposals they submit. Please take a look at your competitors' websites to see how this works, in particular, eLance / Upwork. No verification process, no money required for a multitude of optional skills tests, and just as many projects to bid on as your site. Also, withholding funds from your freelancers, cancelling projects without payment, etc. hurts your business as well as your reputation. I hope you pass this information up the management chain, unless your company is OK with the majority of reviews on this site that are tainting your reputation. Best regards.

610,"Hi

So I did everything that MUST be done from MY side, a new NORMAL employer registers on freelancer.com, and posts a NORMAL project that he was having some problems with this website viewing on iOS devices... Now I(almost 5 years on freelancer.com) bidded on this project and SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED it, and both me and the employer left each other excellent feedback. 

Now when it comes to withdrawing MY correctly WORKED money, I get a ""withdrawal cancelled"" email that the money I want to withdraw came from an account that is under review now... so freelancer.com WANTS for no reason to Verify the Newly registered NORMAL PERSON employer... and I for no LOGIC reason can't withdraw MY WORKED money out because they have THEIR ""issues"" with the employer.... Freelancer.com really should think about Their FREELANCERS because it's because of us why your site is popular and why you have millions of $$ !!!!!!!!!!!!! It really feels like a total SCAM and this is against ANY LAWS to keep my money for no reason from my side, it's MY worked TIME and POWERS!!!!!!!

I will continue writing about this ALL over internet so people know about your ""affairs""!!!

I'm completely disappointed in freelancer.com",1,“Can't withdraw MY money because they WANT the employer(new registered) to Verify their account” 
611,Totally waste of time and money... Confusing payment method and freelancers are just lack of skills... My client was so upset because deadline passed. Never going to use the service again,1,“Can I give NO STAR??PLEASE” 
612,"I had high hopes for the Freelancer website and actually traded some Freelancer shares in the ASX around a year ago.

I created an account 4 days ago and deposited $40AUD.

I took two exams and thought they were $5.50 USD each, but didn't realise there were all these transaction/ currency conversion fees associated with them (I thought this was an Australian company and I'm based in Australia - how does this work??).

I started bidding for some projects and was misled into believing that sponsor fee would only come out if a project is won and also that the sponsor fee would come out of the employer's fund, not mine.

I was awarded one project yesterday.  The employer had not deposited any funds, but I was already charged the project fee.

Upon reflection, most of the project descriptions are very vague and are probably fake projects so that the site can siphon money from the hopeful work-seekers.

I sent in highly private information such as my identification docs and credit card details.  I hope the company abides by the Australian law and terminate my account properly  i.e. permanently deleting my private information.

I only thought to look into others' review of the site after my bad experience, and there are so many awful reviews out there.

I have promptly terminated my account and will raise this matter with the ACCC and have them look into the operation of the Freelancer site.

I'm not sure how an Australian business can operate under this sort of ethics.

This is a dangerous site and it would seem that a lot of people out there have lost a lot of money.  This is simply not right.  Stay away!",1,“Waste of time and money” 
613,"Completed a work from a buyer that start acting fish (pushing to have source code before project completed)

I open a dispute, the buyer agreed to compromise to a bit more than half the price (after i had to pay an hefty $50 fee to freelancer) and I send him the sources... make my withdrawal and after days the withdrawas has been cancelled by freelancer beacuse ""Funds originated from an account that is currently under review"" - i can but suppose the buyer made somethings to have his account blocked and so my founds too!

BUYERS CAN EASY CHEAT YOU: THEY CAN JUST OPEN A PROJECT, EVEN PAY YOU AND THEN DISPUTE WITH FREELANCER AND YOU WILL HAVE WORK FOR NOTHING!!!!",1,"“SCAM SITE, AVOID AT ALL COST” "
614,"I signed up, had two jobs done ($30 and $35). I paid the money, and found out when my credit card company called because there were a LOT of charges being made. So, looking at the fees, I got charged for each project, I got charged for creating the job, I got charged for using a credit card, and I got charged for a deletion fee (on a job I had just paid for?). A chat with customer service said I was being charged some of those fees by my credit card company (Mastercard), which they said was absolutely not true.

Bottom line? With all the fees Freelancer.com adds, the total I paid was $79.26 for two jobs that I paid $65 to have completed. That's a 21% fee rate to use this site! There are so many other sites to use that by going elsewhere you cut the cost by 10%-16% 

Bottom line? What should have been",1,“Only sign up if you want to pay 21% in fees” 
615,Freelancer do not really protect buyers from fraudulent sellers. I had a designer who completed 75% of my website and I was releasing milestones bit by bit. Then the designer suddenly stopped and I never heard from them again. I asked Freelancer the step it as I had lost over £500 and had nothing to show for it. Freelancer refunded me £150. I asked for the designers details as I wanted to take them to court but Freelancer would not give them. I kept  asking Freelancer customer serivce for help but they took me round in circles. Eventually I opened a paypal case against Freelancer to get my money back. When this happened. Freelancer took down a milestone I had with another designer and stole the money. This was in the beginning of October and it is not mid-November. My account is still limited and my money is still gone (£815) in Total. This is a pathetic company with 0 customer service. I hope no-one has the misfortune of dealing with them.,1,“The absolute worst company I have ever dealt with” 
616,"They charged me $10 for two tests, that were very poorly written, and in doing so debited one of my accounts. Later, they blocked me for security reasons to verify my identity, even though they had taken money from my account for worthless exams???  15 day hold on first withdrawal, and will not allow more than one withdrawal to be processed at same time. 10% take up front, whether client pays or not. Convoluted site. Just avoid them. It is no accident that there are scores of one star reviews here.",1,“Horrible!!!! Avoid this site like the plague!!!” 
617,"Did the job, Client did not pay, on top of client gave me 1 start review. Customer services is beyond useless.The fees charge by this company 10% should protect the freelancer against scams and unpaid job. Charging fees for nothing make this site a joke of itself.

I got in contact with larao@freelancer.com. I will report on further developments on this issue.

Update 1: one week went already and I still waiting for and answer from CS Lara from Freelancer. This only can lead to one conclusion. there is only a few people posing as a big company. Poor customer services shows that the business model is good but badly executed. Please stay away from this business. It will be very late when you realize you have hit a wall. Then again you have been warned!!!",1,“HORRIBLE freelancer service ever” 
618,"Short version: Freelancer.com wins money when the employer creates the project and when a worker accept it. Both times freelancer.com gets his money no matter what happens afterwards. The ideal scenario for freelancer.com is to have lots and lots of employers, even if they are thief's, scammers, it doesn't matter, freelancer.com is winning money with this.

Long version: The first project an employer accepts me, it was for $70 and I payed $7 to freelancer.com the moment I accept to do the work. The employer didn't want to make the milestone payment but since he has 12 5-star reviews I accept to do the work first.

After 3 days of work, the employer wants more stuff done even thought I've done everything that was in the project. I've said I would do it after the payment, since I already has done the job.

Then, the employer reviews me with 1-star, marked the project as incomplete. AND USED THE SITE I DONE AS HIS MAIN WEBSITE. Since when I showed him the site, he just steal all the code. His was malicious since the beginning because I put the site on air for just 10 minutes so he can see the project, but he already know how stuff works and grabbed the code.

The fun stuff starts now. Since he didn't pay me I can't review him. WTF? That's why he has 12 5-star reviews in 120 projects! I didn't know that before, but if someone has lots of projects and few reviews DONT ACCEPT IT. If we can just review when we get paid, it's obvious we'll review for 5-star.

That way employers never gets bad reviews. And keep posting projects and getting the results for only $3. And freelancer.com keep winning money. And workers losing it...

The result for me (worker): Minus $7. Work 3 days. Get a 1-review (less chance of find work).

The result for employer: Pay $3 (pay to create the project) to get a FULL HOMEPAGE DONE!

The result for freelancer.com: Won $10

While they don't change that skewed review system THE SITE IS UNUSABLE.

Since the employer is a thief I'm posting his data. If I can't do that please remove the links

""Hello Luis,

Thank you for contacting Freelancer.com Support.

We understand your frustration regarding this. As previously mentioned, the option to leave a feedback and ratings is only available for both parties once the project is completed. Moreover, the feedback system is between an employer and their freelancer and it is not designed for us to intervene.""

--- As you can see the feedback is only available for BOTH parties after the project is complete. But BEFORE that the employer can give you 1-star and you can't review him. It'd make more sense for BOTH parties give review AFTER the project is done. This site wants the most employers they can get, don't matter if they are scam or not, they're making money.

--- I'm trying to get the fee I payed for this project back from paypal (since the project didn't complete). Freelancer.com escalate the dispute for $7 so PAYPAL decide who will get this money.

I've never see a company like that. In general, companies that works serious refund the money with no problem at all. STAY AWAY!

622,"I've been working on freelancer.com for many years with 5 star ratings, although I was never happy with their process of taking fees compared to other reputable sites (like Elance and Upwork). Instead of taking the fee from the freelancer once the project is complete and the client pays, FL takes the fee as soon as you accept the project. So if the client doesn't pay you, you're screwed and FL still made their money. Just yesterday, I completed a project and had $33 in my account, so I set up a withdrawal. I logged in last night and happen to see my account suddenly had only $5.18 and when I went to the financials page, it said I didn't have enough funds to withdraw. So after looking through the transaction history and deciphering all of the accounting lingo, I figured out that FL had reversed a payment I was paid 2 months ago on Sept 1st by a client! I emailed them asking what was going on but have not received a reply. I saw that the client profile was removed so I can only gather that somehow the client's payment method was bad. But why did it take 2 MONTHS for this to turn about? And what is the point of creating a milestone payment, which is supposed to protect a freelancer and ensure we are paid, if the payment method and funds are not 100% verified and available? FL should make sure of that before a client is even allowed to post a project. That seems like a total scam! So now I am out money, and the project I did for that mystery client was basically for free since FL took the money back and I cannot believe they can get away with it.

No intimation was given to us why the funds were not released.

When I enquired, I was told, FL tried to reach client & client was not reachable hence funds are witheld with FL. 

there was nether second attempt to call client nor intimation to us which lead to believe, FL wants to just keep the money with them.

Thank you for emailing us back.

We completely understand the inconvenience this may have caused you. However, due to the employer's violation of our Terms and Conditions, we are unable to process their payment from the project through the site as it may cause potential liabilities for the site.

Due to the reversal of the project payment, your project fee has been refunded to your Freelancer.com account, and as a courtesy, we can give you two (2) months free Premium Membership Plan. This is the only compensation that we can offer you for now.

Please let us know if you want us to apply the two (2) months free membership subscription to your account.

We will wait for your response.

Can anyone please suggest if I can forward this to the Department of Justice, Australia just to make sure none else is hurt?

UPDATE (Nov 12, 2015): Freelancer.Com just reversed the payment made for a project that was COMPLETED & DELIVERED with the client's satisfactory acceptance and feedback! Freelancer also deleted (they say the user deleted it, why should a user be allowed to delete a project that was handed over!) the project that is a deliberate act to remove evidences of a misdeed. I immediately acted with the following support ticket;

============================================================
Subject: Do you mind clarifying your activities?

Summary:

I did a project over Freelancer.Com following all the rules and regulations. The project was completed successfully and the client also made feedback and payment.

Then all of a sudden Freelancer.Com decided to lock down the fund with some issues on the client's end. And finally I see (guess) Freelancer.Com just reversed the payment from the client while the job has already been done and delivered.

In simple sentence, Freelancer.Com decided not to pay me for my work.

(Please feel free to browse my earlier tickets to know the fact, I am not in a mood to type it down here all over again)

Documents: Attached are the proof that;

a. The client was handed over with the deliverables at his satisfaction.
b. Freelancer reversed the associated payments;

Misdeed by Freelancer.Com: The project was DELETED!

a. Why should a COMPLETED & DELIVERED project be deleted?
b. Why should a payment be reversed for a COMPLETED & DELIVERED project?
c. I was not notified of the payment reversal or of the project removal via email!

My requirements: I really need the URL/PDF of your policy in written format so I can forward the entire matter to the Department of Justice, Australia because it is very much clear that you are not at your intention to resolve the matter in an ethically correct way. I also need that policy document for a circulation over the social media available like Site Jabber and others.

Thank you very much for all your so called support and assistance. It is pretty eminent that my days over here has come to an end. I can well understand why people call you SCAM.

And here goes their response!

============================================================
Hi there,

I understand that you have concerns about a reversed payment for a project that you have completed.

If you are referring to the project ""Self-destruct private note php script"" with project ID 8525609, the project was deleted and the employer's account was closed. The employer's account was closed because it was found that they violated the site's Terms and Conditions and the payments that they released to you have to be reversed to its original payment source. This was done as a security measure because we do not want you to be held liable on funds that came from a questionable source.

============================================================

What a caring system! Wow!!! They don't want me to fall under legal penalties for the money source of the employer!!! Someone please kill me!

And what is there in the sections 18-22? A bulletproof set of terms and conditions that Freelancer.Com can withheld (and cancel) your payment even if you deliver the project successfully. And the sole decisoin maker is the Freelancer.Com godly entity... lol

The support staff was prompt enough to show me the terms and conditions, but just forgot to mention their policy to secure the worker's intellectual property/labor!

UPDATE (Oct 27, 2015): Today I received a comparatively acceptable response from ""support@freelancer.com"" stating;

""We regret to learn about what happened and I completely understand your situation. However, your withdrawal has been put on hold due to the current account issues of your employer ********. Note that the proper department has notified your employer and mentioned the issues that have to be resolved through the Verification Center. We'll just have to wait for your employer's response to resolve this issue. As per our Privacy Policies, we cannot disclose any detailed information about the specific issues.""

However, they still don't answer me what is the time period they want to wait for the client's response and what will happen afterwords if the client fails/doesn't respond to their verification request. I do have the right to know this information, don't I? And I believe I am asking for a policy clarification, nothing related to any private/personal information, isn't it?

UPDATE: Too bad! Just had a LIVE CHAT (after about a hundred attempts) with the support and the support personnel just left the chat without answering my questions! Below is the link to the transcript;

http://www.filedropper.com/freelancercom-livechaton22october2015

ORIGINAL REVIEW: A client awarded a project, Freelancer promptly deducted the commission, the job was completed, client accepted the deliverables, client made the payment, Original post: http://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/www.freelancer.com#810

Freelancer.Com added the sum to my financial balance, client put a very positive review and NOW FREELANCER.COM WON'T LET ME WITHDRAW THE FUND because there are some issues with the client's account!

Wow!!! Freelancer.Com always seems to detect the fund was not eligible for withdrawal until it is the last moment on the pay day! A database driven online system cannot detect this when I requested the withdrawal? It had to wait for the pay day to come to see this?

The terrifying factor is, Freelancer.Com has grown a habit of keeping people in dark about what is really going on with simple phrases like ""Account under review"" and replying to support queries after 5/6 days and so on. And the online live chat service, let us not spoil our days!

Freelancer.Com, now where is my time & effort? Where is the commission you already deducted? What will happen if the client doesn't respond at all? How come a project gets the COMPLETE status if the client didn't pay Freelancer.Com?

What a logic, the freelancer is liable for the client's account issues! I was even asked to contact the client to resolve the issue, wow! Did I ask the client to come over Freelancer.Com and offer me the job? What is the reason we work through Freelancer.Com than handling clients directly?

At this point, Freelancer.Com, you just raised a question with online freelancing platform!

BOTTOM LINE: After a number of successful days with them, I AM FRUSTRATED WITH FREELANCER.COM now. Looking for a better platform who at least puts some logical explanation to facts.",1,“Disappointed” 
641,"Started a competition for design website £550 guaranteed. I then changed the description of competition twice, looked at bank statement and freelancer have too £1650 from my account. Spoke with them and they have told me I requested 3 websites???? I have logged a paypal complaint and freelancer have disputed saying I had downloaded and completed 3 times??? downloaded and completed what exactly? competition ran for 30 minutes before I realised and cancelled all transactions and project.

UPDATE

Freelancer are now saying to Paypal that the £1650 is a deposit against work done to try and steal the whole lot!!!! Funny how freelancer agents (who read these) are not commenting on this thread?? 

DO NOT EVER DO A COMPETITION WITH THESE GUYS YOU CAN  JUST WAVE GOODBYE TO YOUR MONEY!!!

BEWARE, why would freelancer say completed transaction to PAYPAL??? unless they were just a complete SCAM!!!!

(have messaged you my username now)

UPDATE 6/11

no contact from freelancer have sent my details.

Freelancer have now changed their story with Paypal, originally they said I had downloaded all the content, then they said it was for 3 websites (same name ???) and now they are saying it was 3 deposits towards one website. Paypal do not refund deposits!!! This is a FRAUD, they know how to play the system with paypal and are completely lying to try and steal £1500+ from me. I cannot state how much you should do NO business with this outfit. Reporting tomorrow to Action Fraud, whom hopefully will investigate. Not just nicking £20 deposits but they are tyring to steal £1500 !!!!!! WOW !!!!",1,“AVOID CON MERCHANTS TOOK £1600 FROM ME!!!!!” 
642,"I RARELY write reviews but I am beyond upset.  An employer hired me and Freelancer.com charged me a percentage of the bid price that was accepted.  The employer decided to not work with me and would NOT cancel the project. I cannot reach her.  I have spent weeks trying to get a reasonable reply from Freelancer.  I finally got someone on live chat who told me that I had to put in a request to cancel 7 days after the expiration of the project.  I was told I would not receive a refund.  Then I was told that the project would automatically close after 28 days and that I will have to request a refund again and an investigation would be done.  Then I was told that the fees are non-refundable.  The guy on the live chat would not provide me with a contact number to speak to someone and ended the chat by simply saying he couldn't help me anymore.  I am now out of money for a service I was unable to provide and Freelancer is a scam.  STAY AWAY!!!!!

REPLY TO FREELANCERS RESPONSE- It has NOT been resolved. You still have my money and I have to invest the time to call back and go through the whole process 28 days after the project expired.  I am not investing another freaking minute trying to resolve this.  To have to wait that long after a project is cancelled to request a refund that I was told I would not get anyway is a waste of time.  I will cut my losses and continue to warn everyone about Freelancer.",1,“DO NOT USE FREELANCER!!!!!!” 
643,"I was scammed by an employer through some currency exchange project. I got my milestones released and I sent the employer money via skrill. However few hours later, my account balance turned to negative and i was penalized. I asked the company why didn't they hold funds of emplyer and penalized him for trapping innocent people? Now they say you have to settle payment issue off-site. How cool they are...a scammer would settle payment issue after scamming me?",1,“Payment Reverse for Exchange Project” 
644,"If you use freelancer it can be good unless you have an issue - then you're screwed!  their customer support process is useless.  It is slow and they have no effort or care.

I can't make payments at the moment and it took 3+ days to get a response to which they said ""must be your bank"" ... I waited 3 days for them to spend 7.5 seconds on the issue...

Not too mention the fact that they just bill you for services that you never ever signed up to.  Thankfully I had credit card problems because when I did, I reviewed my history and saw they had billed me for some subscription plan that I had no idea about.  No notification whatsoever - that's obviously how they make their money - raping an pillaging their users!!!

I'm really starting to hate freelancer - f----ing theives",1,“customer support is terrible!” 
645,"Hello,
I'm writing here because I had terrible experience with Freelancer.com

It letterly stole my money, I get a job with 1250eur the first thing they did is deducting 125eur project fees after finishing the first milestone with 650eur the employer deleted the project two days latery my funds are gone!
I contacted them and they said the employer account suspended.

Now I loosed my money and paid a fee for that!

Why they didn't verify users and payments?

Why should I handle the fees of their bad system?

###UPDATE  25-Oct 2015 ##

BE AWARE OF THIS SITE

This site is the scammers protector they protect scammers and fraudulent not hard working freelancers.

This site claiming that the employer is involved in fraud activity so that why money was reversed.

I asked for the employer name and address to sue him for fraud they refused to give me such information to protect fraudulent from justice!

I think this site  is supporting scammers be a ware.",1,“You shouldn't use this site” 
646,"Hello, due to all the problems you mentioned I heard that a new website about freelancing was recently launched.
It's name is FreelanceTarget.com I checked their price list and comparison table and it's really cheap. Nothing to be paid for the workers!!
The site is populating right now but I think we can give to them a chance, personally I have to revenge all the money that Freelancer.com took from my account with noreason at all!!",1,“My revenge!” 
647,"This site is a nightmare. The support system is there to deflect issues, there is literally no dispute system (it's only there to take some of your money and allow the employer not to pay for work). More then half of the employers are scammers, and they complete less then 30% of the projects they create. The contest system is rigged, and they manipulate the number of projects. Half of the projects in every category are already over. They charge for everything like tests, bids, disputes. I made 900$ in the span of 6 months, and this month I am down 15$. So if you plan on scamming people for free work, by all means, this is the site for you. If you plan to work, stay away from this site. I ended up loosing 15$ on my last 5 projects. Only one of them was paid, and I lost money on all other 4, because of the freelancer fee they make you pay before project starts.",1,“A horror story”

I contact support via chat online, and he said to send mail to support@freelancer.com. Ok done send mail and after 5 hours to get a response from them :

So now all my money that i made by doing the project and ofc the employers got the job done, are gone , i say done wanish , abracadabra ... , and even the guy that i hierd got scamed, they took even that money that i paid him !!!
So ia basicly i worked for free all my work go 0 paid !!

Stay away from freelancer.com, trust me you will regrate using them !!!

I realy hate to post reviews , this is my first review!",1,“Account suspended without any reasons !!!” 
651,"I am not someone who like to post reviews around, but freelancer.com did something that really upset me.

I signed up with freelancer.com long ago, back when they were still getafreelancer.com. For years things had been great, I am an employer who used the website to connect with freelancers. I had a 5-star profile, that is, all freelancers who worked with me in the past gave high remarks. I never leave anyone unpaid, whether the projects turn out to be good or bad.

It all started few months ago when I uploaded some funds to my account (via credit card), freelancer.com payment system charged me several times for that one deposit. I contacted their support and they keep escalating the issues without giving me a proper response. It seems like they are just not interested to solve it. After a while I got fed up with them and went to my bank to reverse the transactions.

I thought it all worked out. It is common sense that if I made a deposit of $30, and you ridiculously charged me several times up to $150, I would had to reverse the $120 transaction. But freelancer.com doesn't think so. Once the bank made the chargebacks they limit my account and asked me for verification (i.e. sending personal documents).

I told them it wasn't my fault that they made several unauthorized charges on my card and the bank reversed the transactions for me. With an experience like that, can I still trust them with my personal info? Their accountants or finance staff should liaise with me when I first contacted them, but no, I didn't receive any helpful response.I suggest they run through their accounting statement, by which they would find they had charged me for the same thing multiple times. But no, they refused to hear what I have to say, and they soon suspended my account, that means taking all the remaining money in it.

It doesn't matter that you took my money, I will forget it in a while. But I will post reviews on here and other websites so everyone can read it for a long time. If your company's credibility is affected, it is karma for what you did. I had been a good customer and never cause any problems for you all these years but then you brought this on me. Today you lost me forever, keep doing such business practices and tomorrow you may lose everyone else.

To everyone reading this, I do not recommend you use freelancer.com, they used to be good but this is no longer the case. Nowadays there are so many issues of financial dishonesty towards their users. Yes they may be a public listed company, but that doesn't matter if on the ground they treat people like you and me badly, and that somehow our money in their system may 'disappear'. Stay away, there are many better alternatives to go for.",1,“I do not recommend any of you to use this website”

656,"*UPDATE* 12.10.2015
This is the support's answer to my inquiry about why my account got closed, where my projects and freelancers are, and whether I'll be compensated:
""Hi there,

Hope you are doing fine.

We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused you. Your account was screened by our system and it detected a probable cause for liability to the site. This is the reason why it has been closed.

Due to unique circumstances, we have reopened your account. Once a project is deleted though, it cannot be retrieved. Hence, we advise that you post new projects on the account to move forward.

We highly recommend to continue working on our site since we have a lot opportunities here. Also, we hope that this experience has not affected your view of Freelancer.com and that you would continue to utilize its services. 

Let us know if you have other queries or concerns.""

Seriously, stay away from these scammers.

*UPDATE*09.10.15
They recovered my account by saying that it was an ""honest mistake"". It looks like they made a habit out of closing accounts for no reason at all. By the way, both of my projects are deleted, and the trust I had from the freelancers is crashed by this ""honest mistake"". Now they probably think that the projects were fake. Freelancer.com has no regard nor respect to its members. I would have never signed up for this website if I cared to read a few reviews here, they are very true. If you are interested in this website's services, go look for similar services, nothing can be worse than freelancer.com!

*ORIGINAL POST*
I posted a project and many freelancers started bidding. I was in continuous contact with them through freelancer.com and giving them the instructions about the job. And today, suddenly, for no reason at all, my account got closed. No notification, nothing! Online chat cant help you with closed accounts; they cant even tell you why and when it happened, and they are very arrogant unless they sound like a bot. Sent a ticket to support, which is supposed to take days according to their confirmation mail! I needed urgent help, which is promised to be delivered by the online chat in the confirmation mail I got from their ticket system, but it asks me to access my account to get that immediate help. But of course my account is closed... The account became indispensable for the business in just a couple of days, and now I might lose my job for this nonsense. The best part is, they DONT HAVE TO explain why they closed your account. 

I was about to pay the freelancers who delivered the job, but now I cant even contact them. I hope they also start writing reviews here about how their employer disappeared before paying them up! 

I am writing this review mostly out of frustration and resentment I feel for their support approach, and in hope of recovering my account. Maybe they will let me know what went wrong if they see this review. I also wrote the representative who answers everybody here. They sound much kinder and attentive over here than they do in their online chat.

Bad experience so far.",1,"“Go look for similar services, nothing can be worse than freelancer.com” "

I have an open project with over $2,000 sitting in milestones. The freelancer wants to paid but I am unable to release the payment. I am using my PayPal account (the very same one I have used 20+ times with them..) and they still ask for more ID.

Now I am forced to contact PayPal for a refund and pay the freelancer separately.

This is the reply:

"" Records show that your employer, julhasalam31, violated Freelancer.coms Terms and Conditions.
Because of this, their account has to be closed and the payments that they have made reversed.
This was done as a security measure because we do not want you to be held liable on funds that came from a questionable source.""

They just closed the client's account and now, they are asking me to pay those dues. They do not have any power to get the copyrighted work. They do not have access to the client. They do not ask him to pay the money. 

It is the freelancers who will do the work and then also pay money for that work. 

Since I cannot pay this money to the company, they will be closing my account. They will send an email to the client to settle for an off-site payment. But, this is all they can do for you

UPDATE: Dear Lara, 
First of all, I am sick of your automated replies. You guys know that you are wrong. You know that you should deduct the fee in the beginning, but you don't take any responsibility. What's the point of working on your website if you cannot provide Escrow protection? You have stolen my work plus my earnings. I am not going to blame the client. It is the freelancer.com that must be blamed for this irresponsible behaviour. 

Everyone, please please stay away from this website.It is a good platform to learn about possible scams happening online. It is also a good site to get your feet wet in the online freelancing world, but there are better options. 

When this problem happened, I wasn't actively seeking work on this website. Otherwise, I would have easily lost $300 here. And, I have submitted 50,000 words for these $300.

Bottom Line: Poor customer support and irresponsible behaviour will kill this website. I got my first client through this site and I had sweet memories, but unfortunately I cannot recommend this platform. 

I read all the replies from Lara (Freelancer.com representative). Believe me, Lara; no one is going to be impressed by these words. It is not solving the problem.

I am writing this so that you keep away from this money robbing site.
Let me explain my case here first
I did bidding for a project and got awarded for same(ID: 8498413). When I accepted this Fixed project, the project fees were immediately charged from my paypal account ,it was 227 USD 
So once i looked into my balance it was showing me in negative and my credit card was charged for 14k INR I was shocked to see that
As this employer himself was someone who actually wanted to get hired and looking to work to earn money as he mentioned to me in message when I tried contacting him after project is awarded to me 
So now i got to know that this project is created as a mistake by that employer an do not involve any work So i raised the dispute and ticket over the fee taken from me 
and I explained everything like above but i got reply that it is a project fees taken when you accepted the project the freelancer team does not even want to read what i said about the employer that he has done mistake by creating project not me by accepting I have raised the dispute at paypal site as well I am not sure what they will decide but i am sick of freelancer people who do not want to listen to freelancers and just charging fees without having any concern whether the project is genuine or not or if the freelancer is not going to get paid how can they give the fees ,I am thinking about filing a legal case against them If i do not get my refund back in next couple of days

Freelancers attempts to suggest that they have addressed this matter falls on deaf ears. Their response was unsatisfactory. They simply refer to their said terms of use and state that the account can be closed without reason or explanation.

Project bidders: 
People with no knowledge and has got good review (don't know how they got good reviews could be paid reviews!!!) and they bid lower price then negotiate the price with you and increase it. Do not deliver project on agreed time and they wont respond for your messages. Once delivered they wont give you time to review and nag you constantly to release the funds for the unworthy work they have delivered. 
Freelance Accounts: 
They are many hidden charges which they don't tell you subscribe with them , you have to figure it yourself by checkig the transaction history. some of the hidden charges are. 
Deposit fee  ($.30 Fixed +2.30 %)
Project Adding fee  + 10% GST
Project deletion fee + 10% GST
If you got less than 30 AUD in your freelancer account then you can't withdraw funds !!! you are trapped.You have to transfer more funds to match the minimum 30$ so that they can again charge you Deposit fee ($.30 Fixed +2.30 %).

I've had more success on websites that specialize in my particular field of expertise.

683,"its a terrible service, partly beacuse the payment systems is bad (frrelancer holds on to my refund for no reason) but most because you get so many offers from freelancers which do not read your job description properly and just want to deliver some stuff to get their money as soon as possible. You need to explain so much to them that you are better of with some real service. Good stuff does cost money. 
On the last job a freelancer (teambeedesigners) started the job, delivered poor work (actually just copied code from another website) and finally was not able to complete. Smart enough he did not properly accept the job via the freelancer platform so i was not able to give a bad review on freelancer itself.

And why is it technically possible to withdraw money on their site if i was supposed to claim a refund? It is my money, i paid it into my freelancer account and i can expect to get it back asap. They just make a lot of fuzz about the difference between refund and withdraw with no use apart for themselves. Even now they need another 10 working days to refund it to my PayPal account... so fed up them. Can´t wait to cancel my account with them. Never, never again .....",1,“very poor”

Apparently, I can't just withdraw this money, freelancer is hanging on to it, and providing no means for me to reclaim it.  I gave up trying to access online chat help, its barely staffed.

Freelancer has advised they are keeping a 3.5% finders fee, for ""finding"" the contractor who did nothing.

Use a different outsourcing platform people, this one is dodgy as hell.

I don't remember giving them permission to keep my credit card details anyway. They trick you into going ahead with a service promising money back guarantee if not satisfied printed clear as day for you to see but then in a sneaky way (information you have to go looking for) will tell you it doesn't actually apply to you.
I asked them to mediate a situation whereby I paid $250 for a project that was not finished and I couldn't use.  They were not able to do this simple request for me. Pretending to care about the customer but did nothing to validate their words. If you do use freelancer there is a company called Afterteam on there based in Sofia, Bulgaria managed by Mr. Kosev.

A foolish idiot even replied to my previous post here and said I had no jobs on the page but actually did and had to go back again to contact customer support who are now supposedly sending out to the employer for resolution. I doubt that will happen. But before Freelancer lets the office fool reply to posts here, he should actually check the full account for jobs accepted. 

So NOW...I bid on a virtual assistant/admin assistant job for an art gallery. I accpeted the job and worked for a whole two weeks for this criminal. They posted under the name reedsusan and their actual name they use as a front is merschen cord artistry world. They steal credit cards and have you run them through various merchant accounts they try to force you to put in your name  and hope they go through undisputed but the cards are stolen and never go through because they are not a legitimate business and have no liscences needed to complete the accounts and customers will immediately dispute the charges. They did not pay me and I firgured out what was going very quickly on so refunded all charges and shut down all accounts before reporting them to the FBI Cyber Crime Division, BBB, FTC and several other channels. So now I am having clean up a mess due to this posting from freelancer.

Please be weary of any jobs on this site. They are fraudulent most of the time and being paid is next to impossible. I have no doubt that the person who posted for the virtual assistant position paid for their account with a stolen credit card. It makes me wonder what actual security measures they have on this page. My identity is not safe here nor have I ever been paid for any job I accpeted here...and I am on other freelnace writing sites where I have had legitimate, paying jobs from reputable entities.

For a multi-million dollar company the support system is terrible ! 
This is my second time trying to use this website in hopes to have work completed and find the right freelancer for the job. It has been a waste of my time again! Clueless freelancers making false promises! Freelancer should require  users to complete skill test before they can bid on certain projects. Then employers clearly know if they are capable of being hired for a job. All freelancer's on freelancer claim they can do the job, just so they can try and get a quick buck, because after you send money it is not refundable. That doesn't help anyone except keep employers frustrated by wasting time and money with no results. 
 I contact the customer service chat, only to get talked to in circles and refer me to the FAQ page. I have to contact support again just to see if Tier 2 had resolved my issue.  Why can't I talk to tier 2 right away? Why is there no confirmation email? It feels like I'm being scammed! I want to know that I'll receive the quality work  I was promised in a timely matter. I tried to transfer my project to another user. The customer chat instructions told me to end the project early, but now I am required to pay another deposit? It makes no sense!
Freelancer clearly states, that when a project is accepted a fully refundable deposit is available. If that was true, they would not hassle people when you try to get a refund and they would not  keep any money including the project fees. I have no problem paying for a project fee if the work I'm paying for is finished and received, but no work was ever received.
After days of trying to get my money back, they then limited my account and had me submit verification records before I could access my account again, even though my money is on there. I also had to cancel my disputes with Paypal against them before they would make my account active again. Finally they send me my 4 deposit refunds but one of the refund is only saying partially refunded? So they're still trying to keep a portion of it? That is definitely not cool with me! This is business not charity, I paid for a service I did not receive, so I expect 100% of my money back. Freelancer won't hesitate to take people's money but Freelancer can't refund it in a timely matter? They want me to wait 3 weeks for a refund, but they can take money in seconds from your account no problem? Freelancer doesn't  even give you an alert when they take the small ""project fees"" from your account I had to contact Paypal over the phone and explain to them the whole situation Paypal has sided with me and Freelancer  will not be keeping any portion of my money!
Freelancer it's simple! If your website does not hold up to it's part and provide the work people are depositing money for, then you have no right to retain any amount of money for a service you were unable to provide.

694,"I have been struggling to withdraw my earnings from Freelancer for two months now. Their system of creating a milestone is supposed to protect all parties involved as it holds the employer's deposit until the project is approved or cancelled. They strongly recommend it and I followed their guidelines. Everything went well the amount reflected in my Freelancer account after the project was approved and released but it took 2 months for me to get any information of when I will see the money in my bank. I finally got an email in the last week stating that the employer's money never cleared to begin with and they have deducted it from my account, although they happily kept the commission they took on the project even though payment wasn't made. I think firstly they shouldn't have allowed me to believe that the deposit was ready and waiting if it hadn't yet in fact been deposited. I went ahead on the job knowing the milestone would protect me and that was false information. Secondly when I try to sort it out with their support team they send you in circles and don't actually do a thing. Eventually I contacted the employer directly and he assures me that the full amount was debited from his account 2 months ago. How do I escalate this? How do I find out which side is the cause of the error? Freelancer's attitude is that it's not their problem and they're terribly sorry about that. $#@!

Hi All,

Recently I received a message on the 02/09/2015

 ""Hey there, I really like your experience and profile and I think you are the most qualified candidate for this job. I'm ready to hire you but before I send out the contract offer, I'd like you to pass a light background check. It is company policy to require all employees/contractors to be screened before being given access to our internal network and documents. Complete the test here: freelancesafe.com (My employer ID is 4731) As soon as I receive the background check result I will send you the contract offer and the initial work instructions. I will reimburse you for the background check cost (10$) in your first paycheck. I'm looking forward to working with you. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me. Cheers, Fodor""

It sounded interesting so I decided to go further so I made the payment and completed the test, then I replied to him:

""Hi Fodor, I did the background check.""

answer from him:

This is your job, you are acting as a broker so you should examine the genuine of a job post before we actually put our money and time. $ 10.00 are not a lot but think with all the people they might applied for this job ... basically this guy instead to pay the freelancer he actually ends up to getting pay.... so if no action will be taken that means that all of us have the freedom to still money... but do you know how it will end up? that you are going to lose a lot of customers.... because freelancer does professional jobs and not theft.",1,“SCAM!!!

To get going I entered a new credit card (Bank A)  and authorized payment of the full contract amount to this credit card. They had info on another credit chard (Bank B) I did not want to use for this project.

I was charged more at Bank A, but said to myself, ok this must include their fees.  But for transparency, I thought then they should have itemized everything like a real vendor before a customer would click yes. (I should have stopped Bank A authorizing the charge at that moment when what I clicked yes to did not match the charge. )

Then at the same time suddenly I was boosted to a full member status without warning.  (I never asked for this, and it would mean monthly charges in the future.)

And then this:  They also -- and at the same time -- made various charges to the Bank B credit card. (The one I did not use) The first one got through, but my bank -- before I even knew it was going on -- stopped the other charge for over 1,600.  I only recently found out about that.

So then I wanted to release initial funds to the contractor to get started on the project -- a first milestone.  Thinking that I had funds in the account (I just paid a bunch of money) I wanted to release a portion to the freelancer to start.  It is fair and shows good will on my part.   With this they billed the milestone payment (plus more fees) to my credit card again for this same project.  

Granted, maybe I made an erro in their system charging myself again: Butt it is clear that they have designed their system for lack of transparency and to get as much as they can as fast as they can through confusion for both freelancer and employer.   (Isn't this how all scammers work?)

Seeing my error, I immediately contacted customer support requesting a reverse of the charge I made to my credit card and Bank A in error.  

(Keep in mind at this point I did not realize they also made a series of test charges to Bank B, then one smallish charge of around 30.00 before their attempt to double bill the project to Bank B.)  

Customer support gave all the BS reasons why they could not do a reverse on the charge in error to Bank A.  They said I had to deal with the freelancer and go to my bank. It was not about solving a problem they could, it was about pushing me off.  I won't bore you with the insane back and forth.  But again, this is how scammers operate.

Then I called my bank and tried to get a stop on that payment I made in error. (It has since gone through.)

Meanwhile, I detected there was a stop on that credit card at Bank B as it kept getting rejected why trying to conduct my daily business.  Low and behold, Freelancer.com had been trying to make charges against that card as well and I did not know it  until my bank smelled something fishy going on.

And not only that.  At the same time I unfortunately entered the trap of  freelancer.com various charges were being made by a software company I had never heard of.   So there were not only unauthorized charges at Bank B by Freelancer.com but also my card had been obviously compromised through their system.

Being upset with these fast folding developments, I then  cancelled the project over Freelancer.com.  I then tried to cancel my membership.  But they won't let me.  Nor can I get the funds of over thousands back from them.

I am now out thousands of dollars for nothing.  They have probably also charged the freelancer even though he no longer has the project.

Hey, I am willing to let them keep the 30-some dollars they did successfully take from Bank B where no charges were authorized.  I'll write that off as a commission they can keep for allowing me to post my project on their site. 

But not the thousands they took from Bank A.

So in short freelancer.com 

1. doubled charged me for one project on two different credit cards,
2. Broke up charges into different fees, unbeknownst to me
3. Did not provide an itemized invoice before clicking the charge approval (like Amazon or any real merchant would)
4. Refused to reverse a large charge made in error (they could have done that immediately, as all honest merchants do all the time. (With the contracted project fully funded they could see that it was an error.)

5. Apparently, almost surely, compromised my card at Bank B (where they did test charges first, and then tried to double bill the project.

6. Have refused to allow me to end my membership even though my project with them is cancelled. 

This is not only terrible for me (it has cost me thousands of dollars and now the project may not be done) but for the freelancer as well as now he does not have the business and it is no way for good freelancers to get business over a platform like that.

Now, if Freelancer. com refunds my money (they can keep the unauthorized money they got from Bank B as their commission for posting my project.) I will revisit this posting and make good.   But for now my strong advice is to stay away, far away from Freelancer.com

Update in response to Freelancer's rely.  

1.  I never upgraded the project.  That is bunk.

2. I was charged on two credit cards for one project.

3. I made an milstone charge to my credit card in error when there were already sufficient funds in my account (eventough Freelancer confused me by saying there was a -0- account.

4. I cancelled the project  after all those charges were made. 

5. As your your ticket?  Huh? Why would I give you my bank details after you already compromised my credit card?  All you need to do is reverse the funds directly.  You know that.  Stop scamming. Stop the lies to your own customers upon which you depend for your survival. 

Like I said, RUN AWAY FAST from freelancer.com

Hope this information helps you Freelancer and take care !!!  

PS: By The Way, Freelancer.com, did you ever wonder why you have practically and absolutely the worst rating possible for an online vendor???",1,“Don't walk RUN AWAY from Freelancer.com” 
712,"A typical chat with Freelancer.com support:
Me: When will me account be verified? The winner of my contest is waiting for his money.

Me: Your colleague has already done that last week, and 2 other colleagues the weeks before. But I did not get any response whatsoever.

713,"So I did a project and completed it 100% and the employer sent me a payment. 2 days later Freelancer.com reversed the payment, yet they still charged me their cut. So now freelancer.com is charging me to do work. They said the employer violated their terms of services, so what does that have to do with MY MONEY? Nothing. They are scam artists. They don't care about freelancers at all. All they care about is getting their cut.... which they charge you even if you don't get paid, and on top of that I pay freelancer a monthly fee. Total Scam. I am reporting them to BBB. Don't use freelancer.com lets put them out of business!!",1,“Freelancer.com is a scam they don't care about freelancers” 
714,"I used their services to hire a ""developer"" based in Bangladesh and they charged me for the same milestone twice because they said that they couldn't charge the original CC I gave them. It has been 3 months and my CC hasn't been able to resolve this issue even though I have proof of the double charge and also I was able to make a screen grab from a page on their site where it clearly shows that they were applying a credit on my acct. Needless to say that they didn't and on top of that, they closed my acct. It looks like you can't file a legitimate claim against them or they will close your acct. as punishment.

On top of everything else, the so called ""developer"" did on my website was garbage. The site was down for a few hours and it became slower than molasses. There is a reason the developers on that site (mostly form third world countries) are able to be willing to work for less, THEY ARE NOT GOOD!",1,“Stay away from this company if you value your money!” 
715,"Again one more stupid reply from freelancer. freelancer holds my bank payment transfer as they are saying my employer told them to hold money. My employer is asking me to complete and go on working without any deposit for milestone 2. So i raise complaint on freelancer regarding the same. see below the stupid reply. i don't know what they are managing for us, when they are not able to solve problem between freelancer and employer .

This is the freelancer reply:-
Thank you for getting back us. 

We do not take any side with regard to the project issue. That is the reason why we contacted you for us to know your explanation on this. We understand that you disagree with some policies on the site, do note that every site has its differences when it comes to particular matter. The site charges project fees for both parties upon acceptance of a project and this has been implemented since the site has started. This is also stated in our Fees and Charges page to let the users aware of this. Indeed, your employer has the obligation to pay you, but as previously mentioned, the project that has been awarded to you is fixed-price; thus, we highly recommend the employers to release the payment after the project completion. If you want to be paid for every completed task, the type of the project should be Hourly and not fixed-price.

Let me know what should i do in this case.",1,“Ridiculous Freelancing website Freelancer.in” 
716,"They use misleading tactics and figures to get you to spend money, a little here and there. But it adds up. So while they may be legitimate, they make a lot of money from unsuspecting novices hoping to make some money. It's like the banking scam where you round to the nearest dollar and you take the change (have you seen the movie Office Space?). Well, they make a few dollars here and there from millions of freelancers who never get paid (some do, I know). This is a very shady business practice in my opinion. Especially when they advertise these small purchase as if it will help us get awarded. But there are contradictions abound. 
If you try to downgrade your account, it warns you that it takes about 30 bids before you get awarded (on average). But wait, I thought if I paid 10$ get my bid to the top of the list and to highlight my bid and do all of that other stuff, then my likelihood of getting awarded would be ""very likely"" 
Well then after 30 bids I should get awarded 10-20 times, right? 
This also implies that if you pay enough money then you will get awarded, even if you are not the most qualified. That's a poor business model, but it helps them make money (Freelancer that is, not us). From the perspective of the person posting a job, that's not a good mindset either. They should want the most qualified. Or they will hire based on their biases (which is something that freelancer cannot control).
It also highly favors older users, or users that have already established a reputation. 
If someone has 40 reviews, and someone has 0 reviews, who would YOU be more likely to award the project to? 
Listen freelancer, if a user has 40 reviews and has a 4.5 star rating, how much more likely are they to be awarded than someone who has no reviews? Is it 500%, 1000%, 2000%, 5000%? Yeah, you don't post those kind of figures because you would lose money.
If you are new, don't expect to be awarded even 1 out of 30 of your bids. Far far less than that. 
It's a subtle scam, but it nonetheless a scam. You really charge $5 per test, every attempt? Really? Really? Foreshame, foreshame. It's not that you charge that's the real problem, it's that you lure us into believing that paying the $5 will increase our chances of being awarded by 370%! What a joke. And I don't want to hear from customer service. You are just within a corrupt flawed system, and you will defend because you are part of it. I know, I worked in customer service before. You are paid to resolve complaints. Well, my complaint is with the entire system of freelancer.com and there is nothing you can do to resolve that. It's a systematic issue, and requires fixing at the top. So please refund all of the money I was scammed out of and delete my account. I have sent 3 tickets already and it's been more than 2 weeks without a response. Bravo.

Edit after Lara's response:
Like I said, the foundation of this company is baseless. Getting rich off the naive dreams of others. 
It's no different than Craig's List, only you don't have to pay to get work on Craig's list. It's full of just as much smut and junk as Craig's list as well. You say you are just a platform, but that's a big joke. Platform's don't get that rich off of the bottom feeders like me. I'm done wasting my time and money on your site. You should be ashamed (the owners, CEO).

Another update, 8/24/2015. 
Customer service refuses to allow me to contact CEO or manager, or they may just be ignoring my request. 
This is rather telling of the sort of company they are running. They do not want to take any responsibility or accountability. It's always our fault, or we agreed to this or that, or we did this or that. There's nothing wrong with freelancer at all, it's we who have the problem.

You may ask for a refund but it is a case to case basis and not all can be refunded. (see attached image)

I tried to focus only on joining contest since I can't get any decent jobs. I always pick the guaranteed ones knowing that It is safer but it is not! I got scam by an employer and freelancer cannot do anything about it.

The freelancer system got loopholes and it is not safe here anymore!!

I made some calculations from day 1 of the contest up to the contest handover where I spend some time to finish the project and after that the money wasn't actually there, freelancer cancelled my withdrawal due to investigation or review on the employer's payment authenticity. I even got a negative balance, what the hell?? They just manipulated my account and fix the problem but I never got the price. For almost 2 months they failed to verify the payment.

I asked freelancer support about the verification process but they don't want to share this; to avoid users on abusing the system it's like they just admitted that their system sucks!

I suspect that they only verify the employer's payment authenticity after the contest handover is done. Imagine doing all the employers request during the contest and contest handover and after that you'll just gonna find out that you got scammed? Do you think this is fair?
They even deleted the contest page where I won. Why??

They offered me a free standard membership for 4 months and told me that they can help? How can that be?? As I've said earlier I already tried this standard membership for 1 year and even switch to lower memberships, didn't any good ones.

744,"I used freelancer.com site for a period of one year with a user name and password. I did my best to make a good profile at freelancer.com. I did six projects and got 5-star ratings. All of a sudden, I witnessed some illegal activity at my account with having a user name and password only with me. I reviewed bids were posted, projects were created and my total money available on my freelancer.com account was illegally used. I had this bad bad experience in this month and on July 8, 2015 I was told my account was closed due to illegal activities. How is this possible for such an account which lasted for one year and had a balance of $120 with a good reputation of five star could be closed without any notice, without warning. Even I asked them to investigate what this site is, are they doing it at their own and illegally grasping all of my earned amount at my account at freelancer. 

I faced this very bad experience at freelancer.com and request to other freelancers please be careful because freelancer.com is a big fraud. They are making money from illegal means. I paid all fees, charges of projects completed then why they closed my account and how they can do it without any inquiry. They held all the amount at my account and replied me today

745,"I have been using for 10 months and never had a bad experience with freelancer.com. But recently I realised that all the reviews (poor reviews) are RIGHT! 

I recently withdraw money which I had in my freelancer.com account.
However, I received the amount of $100 missing. Then I have contacted support centre. 
I was told that there has account issue. 

""Since the employer has not complete the profile, the amount is currently hold. I suggest you to contact the employer and complete the profile""

This is JOKE!!! It says the project has completed and it shows the payment is ""RECEIVED"". But I am unable to withdraw...! (So basically freelancer.com is having this amount unless the employer completes the profile)

I have asked support so what does employer needs to do in order to complete his profile or how do I know if the profile is completed. 
The answer is.... ""unable to give information as Privacy Policy. Please ask employer...""

So the project will continue and shows the payment is received. But there are NO WAY to know if the profile is complete or not and this result ""hold"" payment and unable to withdraw unless you ask the employer... 

If you are tying to use freelancer.com, I don't say do not use but I do not suggest to do big project AT ALL! - The employer might not complete their profile and at the end, you will work for free.

* Support Centre is useless!!! - All they say is ""Ask employer.""

They really need to change some system... Well, as I have experienced this, I rate freelancer.com with one star.",1,"“At the end, you will anyway loose some money and work for free.” "
746,Why do I receive 30 automated proposals within 20 seconds of posting a project!! All the bids coming in are like robots !! Please get rid of this and let each provider bid manually. I checked my project after 24 hours and I had over 150 proposals 95% of them were auto proposals  without anyone reading my project brief. This is the reason most of the projects posted go unawarded. Please don't over whelm the client with 100's of AUTOMATED bids!!!,1,“Please get rid of AUTOMATED PROPOSALS!!!!!!!!” 
747,"So we only joined Freelancer yesterday and already it has been a terrible experience.

We were looking to get a mobile app built and with it came a healthy enough USD budget. When putting up the job spec we hoped to attract some great freelancers that we could do repeat business with. Unfortunately not, the bulk of them look like spam and bad spam at that. 

Today after 100 applications that we cannot trust we have decided to close our Freelancer account. 

Here's why:

* Automatic Applications - allows freelancers to automatically apply. Means no one is reading your job spec. Within 5 minutes we had over 40 applications. One of our requirements to applicants was to download our current app and thoroughly review before applying. 
* No personalised responses - Over 100 applications so far and only 2 were personalised about the job itself (even then they copied and pasted from our job spec)
* Fake Profile Images - High percentage of applications had profiles pictures of young asian girls? Extremely bizarre if you are a real developer or company. Quick search in google saw the same images on Ebay shops etc. 
* Fake feedback - very easy to spot that multiple accounts have been set up giving each other feedback
* Too many emails - I have received over 20 emails in my inbox from Freelancer in under 24 hours
* Contact outside of Freelancer - 2 applicants contacted our company directly by email to beg us to hire them
* Upselling - Have too many emails or applications? Its fine you can pay Freelancer to search through the crap. There should be no crap in the first place. It seems that freelancer encourages spam.
* Customer service - Robotic answers. When I emailed to ask why the majority of my applicants had automatic responses and fake images of young asian girls, their response was that they can assure me all applicants go through a verification process. Not really a good answer is it?

The above leads me to believe that Freelancer.com really don't care about the quality of their freelancers and only want to make money. As an employer with limited time on my hands I cannot believe they think this business model would work for anyone who is looking to hire.

I was looking for serious freelancers and got nothing of the sort. I feel sorry for the genuine developers on this site as employers will not know who is real or not. As a first time experience I would be suggesting to other employers to stay away from the site and not waste your time. 

Hopefully freelancer.com take these suggestion on board. My guess though is that a robotic answer will follow.",1,“Employers perspective - not a good one”

after many support tickets the website didn't want to refund nothing because advanced payments are not in the rules,

751,"I joined freelancer.com in 2007. It was then getafreelancer.com and charging just $6 for gold membership. Later they increased few dollars. But everything was free once you pay for that gold membership including payment received. Site was provider friendly.I worked hard and got top 5 rank in provider list. 

Then it changed its name and owner and suddenly everything became very costly. Now it has a premium membership for $199.95 per month still you have to pay 3% project fee from every earning. I don't think anybody can earn such a big amount from this site every month because there huge number of bidder in each project and chances of earning good number of project every month is very low. I never won any case against a buyer in freelancer.com though I provided client approval and other proofs.

I read a lot about payment reversal and other scam in freelancer.com but never believed these till a morning when I opened my freelancer.com account and found balance - $ 350. Fund of $90 which was in my account also transferred to freelancer.com so total $446 was debited from account. Next day again they changed Indian rupee and AUD to dollar and withdrew $120. So all amount with gone from account and it was still showing balance -$270.

When I contacted freelancer support about it they replied that one of my clients who paid to me had some dispute with someone so to recover payment from this client they reversed all payment which he paid to workers including mine. But freelancer.com never informed me that this client had any dispute with someone. I received payment and reviews so everything seems fine for me. I cant check other accounts so how could I knew whether a client had some dispute with others or not. I lost $446 without and fault. Now freelancer .com has stopped my premium membership so I cant bid in more than a 10 projects in a month. They are sending email to deposit money so they could renew membership but I dont know my mistake and reason for this reverse transaction.

         00:43 Me: but he says that  he already paid to me

         00:45 Dave S.: Please contact them  directly to discuss your payment.

         00:45 Dave S.: The funds have been   reversed to their account.

 also changed tousd today

         00:47 Me: I dont have  balance to renew my membership

         00:47 Dave S.: Your INR funds were    converted into USD since your USD funds does not
 have sufficient  funds when the reversal was processed.

         00:50 Me: but is it    possible for me to work as general member and earn
 $250 and  deposit it to freelancer.com

         00:51 Dave S.: Yes,

         00:51 Me: Do you want me  to stop working at freelancer.com

         00:51 Dave S.: Please contact your   employer directly, 
         00:52 Me: I am not     satisfied with your reply. I am afraid that it will
 be repeated   in future

         00:53 Me: Fund from my  account can be withdraw using any excuse

         00:54 Dave S.: You may consult  Sections 18-22 of our User Agreement page for an
 explanation on    this:

One of the biggest online scams right now is in the ""freelance writing"" area.

The biggest company in this area is called iWriter and it is maybe the biggest online scam period.

Ignore all the fake positive reviews and fake websites recommending iWriter while pretending to be independent, they are all a part of the scam.

 Iwriter is not just a huge scam, it is maybe the biggest of all the online scams.

There is an awesome website that uncovers the whole iWriter scam in great detail. The site is hilarious and extremely well-written.

It's also very thorough and comprehensive, maybe the best resource available yet on the iWriter scam. 

That website shows clearly how fraud is not just peripheral to iWriter, but on the contrary, EVERYTHING at iWriter is fraud and scamming.

For some reason my credit card provider would not allow payment of services to Freelancer. I took the next step and attempted to get a Skrill account to handle the payment issue only to find out that because of where I live Skrill wont work with me.
Upon reporting this to the staff of Freelancer they stated perhaps I should try another payment gateway service. Now its clear I made multiple attempts to pay for services and they even attested to that, but they were not willing to do whatever it takes to fix the issue.
A freelancer had accepted my project and I had tried to pay this person only to fail because of some policy between my card provider and Freelancer. The only solid resolution I could see is that in order to maintain my professional reputation and ensure the freelancer is taken care of is to have bitten the bullet and credit the freelancer on my behalf  for the project as it was accepted and they had already begun work on it.
Yes that would have cost them but now it will cost them more because I have closed my account and had another 4 to 6 projects with this specific freelancer in the pipeline.

As a graphic designer, freelancer.com destroyed me psychologically, maybe i'm not the best designer in the world but almost all clients i dealt with approved my first preview design without revisions needed.
If you have a large capacity of good luck then freelancer.com might be useful for you, and you don't have to be a pro or work hard at all, cause in most cases keep in mind that:

1- the contest holder will pick a design which is opposite to the brief.
2- the CH will pick a stock design or something stolen from previous ideas.
3- the CH will reject your hard work design without any feedback or rating.
4- the CH will pick himself!, by making another account as a designer, and this will give him a lot of logos and concepts for FREE.
5- the winner is picked before the contest ends, and you'll discover this either after announcing the winner and when the contest become unsealed, or while it's running, there was an agreement reached while the poor designers still working hard.
6- you will find cheap designers offering the CH an extra designs like business card or a letterhead and even a full stationary at the private message under their entries (which's actually not private).
7- at some point you'll feel like freelancer.com & contest holders are the masters and you're the slave, when there's a lot of entries, a lot of new modifications, a lot of rejection, a lot of hidden agreements.
8- freelancer.com do not give a damn about the points above ( i made a lot of reports and messaged them on FB).

Number one if they were catering to artists, there'd be an option to do a folder upload like Flicker or Facebook.",1,“Scam!” 
772,"Recently I gave Freelancer a third chance. Why? I guess I am just dumb.

Everything was fine and then they decided to take micro amounts off my credit card to verify it. This Micro amount was not authorized.  I pay major fees for conversion and online use. The 25 cent charge came to almost 20 dollars.

SO I contacted support and told them I wanted that reversed and I cancelled my contest I wanted that charge reversed as well.

I told them i am cancelling the account and the money should go onto my visa.

Surprise surprise I login to close my account and the refund is in my Freelancer account. So now to get my money I have to either connect a paypal account and give them a MONTH to verify it, pay paypal to get my money, pay freelancer a transaction charge, and then get it from paypal to my bank.

So basically they did not refund my money.  Just for SEO purposes I am going to repeat myself.

Freelancer.com is fake. Freelancer.com is fake. Freelancer.com is fake.

Visa does not recommend using Freelancer.com. Visa does not recommend using Freelancer.com. Visa does not recommend using Freelancer.com. (on the phone with them now)

Most Freelancer.com policies break Canadian Laws! Most Freelancer.com policies break Canadian Laws! Most Freelancer.com policies break Canadian Laws! Most Freelancer.com policies break Canadian Laws! Most Freelancer.com policies break Canadian Laws! Most Freelancer.com policies break Canadian Laws!

Now that should help Googlers figure out whats up.

Use any other site.  Use any other company.  I am having Visa dispute the charges. They seem to think its ok to swindle people.  

Show Freelancer how it is. Stop using them. They cost time and money and waste time when you try to get any assistance. They are a bunch of fools really.  

I hope Visa refuses to issue payments to them once I am done.

Stay away, hire a contractor in the end its cheaper.  I have yet to get anything done successfully on this site without being nickle and dimmed to the point where it costs more than hiring a firm and the work is inferior to say the least. 

I am on the phone with Visa, and they are dragging out the chat. 5 to 10 min between responses. No phone number to call. No accountability.

BEWARE.

LARA:

I am on chat getting a run around. Visa wants to know why you think its ok to take any money without permission. They also a refund is automatic and it should never have shown as a balance in my account.

I'm waiting for your support rep in chat while i have Visa on the phone waiting.  This has been almost 20 min. Visa is ready to give me a refund and mark you as fraudulent. Review my account all you like, this is just the facts.

For the rest of the world here's Henry's answer to where is my refund why is it in my account:

""We understand that you want the funds returned to your bank. The refund case is with our Finance Department already and in the process of having the funds returned from your Freelancer.com account to your credit card. Our Finance Department will contact you directly through Ticket ID: HGT-732-57782.
""

Theres not much to refund when its a credit card.

And now Visa is saying go ahead and claim the transaction as fraudulent after being made wait in a chat for more than 20 minutes and no reply for the past 10.  That is directly from Visa. Do not use this site, if a credit card company says they are an issue clearly they are.

Even after telling them I was having the charge reversed by Visa they still give me a run around

""They will directly get your message at Ticket ID: HGT-732-57782. You can send them a message via the ticket or the email thread you received.""

This was the response to wanting a phone number for Visa to contact their accounts department.  With Visa on the phone with me it took Henry 20 minutes to give me that answer.

Again I ask is this someone you want to do business with?

I have been writing this review as it happens so you can see for yourself. In the time frame of an hour this is the most response I have received.  They can not do anything, sorry they dont care if they are listed with Visa as fraudulent and have no respect for other peoples time. Including the credit card companies.",1,"“THEY ARE THIEVES, ONE STAR IS GIVING THEM TOO MUCH” "

774,"Hi. I joined Freelancer about a year ago, and I did that open eyed - means, I read the different opinions of people all over the web. Of course they were mostly negative. (Very few people take the time to think, even less write, about positive experiences. That's, how we apes tick.)
Anyway  I am a paying member. And before I joined as a premium member, of course I read the TOS. I'm longer in business than most of the people active with web businesses are alive, and I feel better if I know, what's going on.
I don't employ at Freelancer, I bid on projects to sell my services. Freelancer is not of special importance for my income, I use the site as a gap filler, but I admit that I had some real fun projects here and met some actually great people. My set of skills is a rather unusual combination, and through Freelancer I have the occasion to do things, I am not required to do for my regular customer base.
I have a 5/5 rating for the 24 projects I made, and I had to kick out just one customer who constantly increased his demands up to a not longer acceptable point.

So, last week, I made a bid on an offer by one user Dom1000 (posted in lousy German) which translated would read
Writing of a Blog Text

The bid was 88EUR, I demanded 2 milestones, I got the job and Freelancer cashed their 11.1%
I delivered, as agreed, the first half of my work. A couple of hours later the employer contacted me from a second account he had opened  hkayso2s  and informed me that his original account was blocked by Freelancer. If I understood the scat-German he used right, this was because he issued a cash-back through PayPal, obviously for the only other project he ran through Freelancer.
The employer now wanted to use the second account to offer me 44 US-Dollars (remember: is was Euros first...) to pay me the first milestone. 

As far as I remember  at least when I joined  USING FREELANCERs SERVICES WITH MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS FOR THE SAME ENTITY IS A VIOLATION OF THEIR TOS

I told him to wait till his original account is either back open or deleted, because I would not work for him until I got my original, first milestone. Because  what is an agreement good for, if it is not kept.

I also used the FL ticket system to inform them about the case, the multiple accounts, and told them, I want the project to be cancelled WITHOUT A NEGATIVE EFFECT TO MY STATS.
My good right, I think, as I was not the one who did not deliver  the employer was the one who did not pay as agreed. I even told them, they could keep the 8.80EUR they took from me.

I received a canned response, mainly telling me: We are unable to discuss any information regarding your employer's account.
I didn't want to discuss any accounts: I wanted the project to be cancelled, remember?

During some unwanted chat with the employer, he now offered to pay me outside Freelancer. THIS IS A VIOLATION OF FREELANCERs TOS.
He also tried to lure me in additional (probably unpaid?) work and gave me a link to a website, where he and his partner (with a near-east migration background like my original contact) openly offer the delivery of fake scientific work for schools and academical institutions. IN GERMANY, THIS IS A CRIME, and not long ago it costed two German politicians their jobs.
So before continuing with discussions with FL and the employer, I took appropriate actions. As of now, I am not allowed to talk about those, I will do so, when I get the green light from the authorities.

Again, I wrote to FL, and explained (again) that I want the project to be cancelled. Again, I got a canned text back, containing, if anything, the same information I already had. And Freelancer RE-OPENED THE EMPLOYERS ACCOUNT. This makes me believe, that the service personal either did not have the time to read my eMail, or wasn't able to by other reasons.

To the employer I insisted to get my first payment. And he (now, after first accepting the work) wanted additional work to be done to even be able to accept it - two days, after he got the first delivery and liked it.

Because the employer saw his prey swim away, they filed a dispute.

Again, I wrote to FL, letting them know that I won't accept any negative effects to my reputation.
FL made their job easy this time  they did not respond.

The employer RE.-POSTED THE PROJECT (OF COURSE ONLY THE SECOND HALF, AS HE OBVIOUSLY WANTS TO USE MY WORK FOR THE FIRST HALF  GOOD LUCK WITH THIS...)

This time, he writes right into the projects headline, Hausarbeit (homework, a term for an academical paper to be done by a student, personally...) to make clear that he not only wants somebody to help him break the law, but also that
THIS IS AGAIN A PROJECT WHICH IS ***INVALID***, AS EXPLAINED IN FREELANCERS TOS.

So, obviously, an employer requesting criminal activities for Freelancer is more important than a competent freelancer with obvious success and and also obvious very high quality of work.

Quo vadis, Freelancer.com?

For me, the problem will be quickly solved: if the dispute is not solved exactly the way I want it, means, with no negative outcome for me, just a cancellation of the project, this was it. I don't need Freelancer.com, but they urgently need more honest people on both sides of the cash-flow.

782,"Sir,
     Freelancer is a big and famous website that offers freelancer services to hire for business purposes. I had hired a freelancer to Design a logo for my company. I hired him and had to pay him 1500($25 approx). I selected the payment method as Paypal which was accepted on their website, a receipt was generated for 1500($25 approx) and I paid. After the payment was successful suddenly I realised that 100000($1534.80) were debited from my account instead of 1500($25 approx).

 I immediately emailed and chatted with the customer service of Freelancer and they said they will refund, but after 2 days had passed nothing happened. I again contacted them and they said that they have refunded the amount back to my Paypal account and even gave me a receipt for the refund. After another 2 days the balance dint show on my Paypal account, I again contacted Freelancer and they said that the fault is because of the Paypal service. I contacted Paypal and they said that no refund was initiated from Freelancer and if they do have refunded they(Freelancer) have to call Paypal and sort the matter. I told the incident to Freelancer and they then agreed that they had held up my payment and wont give it back until I called Paypal and tell them that I dont want a refund as it makes 'matter complicated'. I called Paypal again letting them know that Freelancer wants to me close the dispute. Paypal strictly advised not to close the dispute as then refunding my money will be next to impossible.

 I have till now mailed Freelancer over 25 times and every time they blackmail me by saying closed the dispute and then we will see how much and when to refund. I gave them a warning that Ill go to court and still they dint agree, after I was adamant that I will not close the dispute and will move to court, they are now for over 4 days keep replying me the message saying that my case has been transferred to another department and I will hear from them within 48hours. Its been many days now and since the start I have been jumping from talking to their department to department (chat, refund, Verification, billing and more).

 Freelancer has now even limited my account and are threatening to block it and not refund the money at all. After searching on the net I found thousands of other similar cases where Freelancer debits money or doesnt refund the left balance of a customer back to them. Freelancer even agreed to the mistake of by fault debiting $1500 instead of 1500, but isnt refunding.

 Iam a very small man compared to this billion dollar company and I dont know what to do. These guys dont have any phone number\email of management\Address in my country. Please help me, I can provide with any proof you like. I even have saved all the chats and emails.

786,"Hello,

I've been working as a freelancer since 2011, and the first website I've used was VWorker (that was bought by Freelancer). VWorker was like 1000 times better. They would take care of their users by holding the money until the job was done, and if the freelancer delivered, and the employer was happy, the money was released.
But with Freelancer, that's another story. You don't have any kind of security that you will get paid for your job. I did a small project for 100$. Freelacer withdraw from my balance 25$, because I've accepted the project. I did the job, deliver it, but the employer did not paid me. In fact he just ignored me. I've tried to talk with someone from Freelancer, because I don't think it was normal for me to pay the acceptance fee, for a project I was not paid for. But nothing!

So bottom line is that I've PAID 254 do work for free!
Also, they have a habbit of withdrawing money from your paypal balance, and if you don't have money in your paypal balance, they will charge your credit card that is linked to your paypal accout, so you might want to cancel your Preapproved payments to Freelancer from your paypal account.

788,"Hi All, 

Of all the tech services I've used online Freelancer.com has by far the worst customer service. Here is why:

I put on a bid, and then spent 1 week to do due diligence on all the bids. I then find a decent freelancer, and when I try to pay the milestone their checkout system fails. This has happened 4-5 times earlier, and after a couple of emails front and back they can normally resolve it. This is not ideal, but I find it okay for a growing tech company. 

Just after I solved the payment issue they closed my account without warning, and without any reason. I send them an email, and this is what I get back.: 

""Thank you for contacting our Support Desk.

Your account has been closed by Freelancer.com administrator. We offer no recourse or rebuttal for this penalty.

As most people can tell this is just copy pasted to everyone that asked why their account is closed down. I sent another email and I get the same copy pasted answer again.  

I decide to create a new account, and repost the project. After 3 days, they close my new account. Again, without any reason. I send them a 1,5 page email to understand what I'm doing wrong, and I get this back: 

""Thank you for contacting Freelancer.com Support.

We appreciate your feedback regarding our website and support. However, the closure of your account is due to the violation of our Terms and Conditions. Having said this, the option for us to lift the account closure is not available anymore.""

This time, it's not a completely copy and pasted answer, but still another wage confusing answer. I find the last sentence interesting since I wrote them an email a couple of minutes after they canceled my account. 

Since they cancel accounts left, and right without reason, and don't treat their customers with any respect, I'd recommend anyone reading this to use other services  such as odesk.com, and elance.com.

I find freelancer.com a great example of a tech company that is growing too fast, and completely neglected the quality of their customer support.",1,“Terrible Customer Service” 
789,"Having used this website both to do freelance work and to get work done, here's what I have to say:

They don't charge anything for posting a gig there, and do not vet what gets posted so all kind of crap appears there daily. Roughly 90% of projects are just noise ranging from ""develop a clone of amazon.com, budget $30"" to solicitation of prostitution.

If you're willing to wade through this pile of rubbish to find what appear to be real projects you'll quickly find at least half of them are either 1. Run by a scammer or 2. A fake, in all likelihood posted by freelancer.con itself.

Projects run by a scammer are real, in the sense you'll have to do real work. Sadly you'll never see a cent from them. Beware! This website is scammer central, plenty will award you a project, just to revert charges after completion or just paying a small milestone and leaving the projects open indefinitely, cheating you out of most of your money. In either case freelancer.con won't do a thing to help recover your money. Just read how many cases are documented in this review website alone. This kind of thing happens every single day there, and no matter how careful you are sooner or later you'll get bitten. Some of the scammers are amateurs trying their first hustle, others are professional criminal networks that have been doing for years. And some seem to be in cahoots with freelancer.con themselves.

Fake projects are there just to make the website look more attractive and enticing new users to sign-up. When you apply to them you'll never hear back from the poster and the projects will eventually expire and close themselves. They are only there to make it look like freelancer.con has good gigs up for grabs. Not so! I'm willing to bet this company has an offshore team of people posting fake projects 24/7. If you spend enough time on their website you'll start noticing the patterns.

So are there any legit projects on freelancer.con? Yes, they exist. I've done a few and I've got paid for them. I've also posted gigs there, paid fairly and got rave reviews for doing so. You can find gigs there on a daily basis, unfortunately most are paid at rates than make even Asian sweatshops cringe in disgust. From time to time real projects, run by honest people and with realistic budgets get posted. Been there, done that. Sadly, they generally get spammed to death by the aforementioned Asian sweatshops driving the poster away, usually to never go back.

Just banning India, Pakistan and Bangladesh would probably cut 90% of the issues with this site. Ban also Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Thailand and China and you cut 99% of the troublemakers. If you're looking for work just look for projects originating from first world countries, same thing if you're looking for freelancers although I would also consider Eastern European and South Americans, I've had nothing but positive experiences with the latter.

Beware, though. Some crafty ones have proxies and verified identities in countries such as the UK, the US or Canada to fly under the radar.

As many others before me, I've been overcharged by freelancer.con, scammed out of project fees, and have had my withdrawal requests cancelled. Fortunately when that happened I was still in contact with the company that posted the project, which is run by a pretty cool guy, and he said his account had been suspended and showed a negative balance. They literally emptied their PayPal account with their hidden fees. This was on a project I was being paid £600 (minus 10% freelancer.con cut) and they had over £750 in their account at the time and still owed them money. Furthermore they demanded a huge amount of documentation ranging from passport scans to public utility bills to prove their identity, things that are against the law in all EU countries, but apparently are tolerated in Australia. Needless to say, they didn't want to keep doing business with freelancer.con. On the other hand, we have continued doing business together, they pay directly to me and we both couldn't be any happier. Although I never got paid for the first gig, freelancer.con pocketed £750.

I withdrew the money from my account to bank account. I got my money in my hand. The problem started after 7 days after withdrawing the amount, when i logged in my account i was surprised to see my account as limited, wrote atleast 10 mails to support, three mail where replied with lame and stupid replies like we understand your problem etc etc, after that verification team asked docs for verification i gave and got verified for 4 days this verification continued, then today when i logged in and saw another surprise, my funds showed -$180 ( $20 was project fee that i was refunded, total project was of $200), on seeing dashboard i see that project got deleted, how does that matter if a completed project is deleted?? How can a person with sense and brain charge money for the project that was deleted after it was completed and whose payment was completed.

If you people look at my problem it is a total scam website, even if the project is deleted for some problem in employer then freelancer.com should bear the charges because i accepted the project from a 100% verified employer, guys do not waste on this scam website, i faced many other issues on this website that i did not mention here,  so i will say that freelancer will have to bear all the charges of any mistake of employer or site administrator.",1,"“This site is total scam,  takes total money back that employer pays you, serious programmer avoid it” "
793,"Hi everyone,
I was working on a project with my profile name sourabb on the freelancer.com website, i worked for an employer and the project was nearly 10 days old (time enough to verify anyones account either employer or freelancer), the total milestone was done by the employer, after he was happy with my work he released the milestone i withdrew nearly $180 (after paying the project fee) from my freelancer.com account. I was happy that i will be able to pay my bills as it was my month ending, but after 2 or 3 days when i logged into my account i was suprised to see nearly -$180 in my account, after contacting the support they told me that employer did not verify his account so they send back money to his credit and i need to full fill the negative balance with the project fee i.e -$200.
What the hell did i work for nearly 15 days so after withdrawing the amount i will need to work to full fill the negative balance, just can't these people allow employer to create project once they verify everything. Guys i can tell only one thing this site is so unreliable, you can never be sure when and what time this site will create an issue for you. I am still using this site a bit, but i am totally unsatisfied with the service, so be carefull if you are planing to make this site as your major source of income. I need my balance back to zero as it was not my fault to work on a project, verification is the job of freelancer admin not mine.",1,“Reversed the payment that i withdrew after many days” 
794,"I signed up for freelancer 3 days ago.  I quickly found this was a mistake. Hidden fees for every action. Post a job, pay a fee. hold your money from PayPal, pay a fee. Have a dispute and want your money back? $5 fee! Then they tried getting $100 extra dollars out of my PayPal. I called PayPal and they quickly resolved the matter. Every dime Freelancer took from me was restored. They made it where Freelancer could no longer charge me for anything, and I will never deal with them again.  I urge everyone who is on freelancer to take your money and run! Do no deal with these scam artists!",1,“Never go here!” 
795,"I decided to use freelancer for one project, during which went terribly the user was only able to complete one of the two tasks but insisted for the final milestone payout then got really annoyed he did not get the final payment.

I find the freelancers on the site are conners and beggers the task I gave was two very simple tasks all could be solved with CSS, not really worth the $30 work, many where asking for $50+ to do one line of CSS complaining that the work would be complex and hard, even though the solution was one line.

Freelancer them selves are theives, hidden fees everwhere, you award a freelancer for work, pay us. You release a milestone, pay us. You start challenge, pay us. You delete a project, pay us. all of this is without notice and automatic making you easily lose a lot of money on a single project.

Not worth a single penny and I can assure you after this I will never use my account again lets hope closing an account does not cost anything.

So if you are thinking of using freelancer my suggestion is DON'T you will not get the desired work, reliable freelancer at a cheap cost as promised, it will be undesireable incompleted work with an unreliable and untrustworthy freelancer and will cost you an arm and a leg.

796,"I put in a withdraw request 15 days ago. Today I got another job, and they took a $60 fee for that (which is completely outrageous), automatically canceled my withdraw that I'd been waiting 15 days for, told me i had insuffiecent funds because of this which will cause me to have to wait another 15 days apparently since it's my first withdraw. Now my question is: WHY ON EARTH WOULDN'T YOU GIVE ME THE OPTION TO PAY WITH MY DEBIT CARD, MY BANK ACCT, ECT RATHER THAN SCREW ME OVER AND MAKE ME HAVE TO WAIT AN ADDITIONAL 2 WEEKS TO GET THE FUNDS??? From what I gather from other comments on here it's because you love to screw people over and hold their money freelancer.

The support:
I just got done talking to freelancer support for about 30 minutes. In this 30 minutes the live chat person answered maybe 2 of my 15+ questions, and blatently ignored all the others. I asked questions about why my money was being held. I was told (after maybe 15 minutes of asking) that your first withdraw takes 15 days to process for security reasons. I than asked what security reasons and got no response even when I asked multiple times. I asked the person if I could speak to their supervisor, and again this question was ignored. I asked if they would be mad if they didn't get money they were expecting to get for an entire month after initially withdrawing it? Again, no response. I asked where I could rate them and they told me a rating survey would appear when I exited the conversation. Well, I did this and there was no rating survey. It was probably the worst live chat experience I've ever had in my life. I am not going to leave my username below because this horrible company will probably just screw me over again and again.

Benni25 Mauritius Translator Translation Freelancer.com
 https://www.freelancer.com/u/benni25.html 

The freelancer or company under the above mentioned link conducts poor business practices which I can confirm as a victim.
I was contacted by this individual (i don't think it is a company) on oDesk.com  They said they were a translation company looking for staff. They asked for a test of almost 900 words which is unusual.  Translation companies normally would ask for a test for less than 400 words.
When i refused, ""benni25"" said they would pay for that test.  I accepted believing in his good faith.  He said it would only take a few hours to review the test as he already had that text test translated.  I delivered the text and the next day he contacted me again.  I thought it was to concrete my payment.  Surprisingly he asked for another test. I asked whether he had the results of the first test.  He said NO.  I told him I would prefer to wait for the results of the first test, get my payment and then proceed with the second test which he would also pay for.  As per this unusual approach i decided to investigate.  I contacted Mr. Klaus Deschka at VinPilot.com who resulted to be a client of ""benni25"".  I sent my translation to Mr. Deschka who confirmed that my text was exactly the text he received from benni25.  He has paid aprox. USD20 for that text.  I had agreed with ""benni25"" USD 34,36.   With this evidence, I confronted Benni25 who immediately put down his web site www.bennitranslationservices.com and the email addresses he had used to contact me: odesk@bennitranslationservices.com and accountsdpt@bennitranslations.com.  DUMP was my first conclusion.  I understood in that moment how some freelancers are able to offer ridiculous rates for a translation.  I decided to contact many of the clients of benni25 on freelancer.com.  All of them had realized with the time that benni25 has delivered them very poor translations and that they had to have those translation redone increasing theirs costs.  I can mention xtblue (writers for right) in Pensacola, Usa, Steve Coy at TotoIt Group, a freelance translator Jan Krister and many others.  I reported Benni25's profile to the Freelance.com administration with no results.  They were blind  regading this unscrupulous behivaiour even though i provided the testimonials of his clients on that site.  How can Freelancer.com allow such individual to mislead clients and other freelancers? How can Freelancer.com allow an individual to dump prices to compete in advantage with honest and professional freelancers? How can Freelancer.com allow this individual to keep delivering translations and some other assignments with a doubtful quality affecting the corporative image of the clients using his services?  This is really sad.
Please visit http://www.propertytailoredmanagement.info/benni-translation-services/ for more details on this issue.
Should you be a freelancer.com freelance professional of company hiring services and you have been victimized by benni25 please address to the site administration.  Perhaps they need to collect 100 testimonials before proceeding with justice.

I bid for a virtual assistant job, 'company' had good reviews and had used Freelancer for a few years so thought i'd give it a go.
Next day, get an email to contact the guy via Skype to discuss the role...upon getting on Skype it wasn't the role he had advertised but wanted me to write a 1000 word essay on  South East Asian education for around $20. I politely declined and he then suggested another role, being in a YouTube video for his clothing brand. It seemed (semi) legit but I was not too keen, he persisted and asked to see some non-revealing clothes from my wardrobe so I could wear them in his video. Ok....I (stupidly) showed him, on the hanger, a buttoned up shirt.
This was not good enough, he then requested I took my clothes off (on camera) to show him, upon saying no he then asked me if I had any strapless top's or a mini skirt to wear. I felt extremely uncomfortable and said so - I kept trying to politely end the conversation so he would go away but he then proceeded to tell me to take my cardigan off and stand away from the camera so he could see all of me. At this point I cancelled the call and went straight to Freelancer to report him - whilst he continually harassed me on Skype.

I am not going to use freelancer.com in future and will also suggest all my friends to never use this, yes i will loadge case against them and will share this thing to all of my places and what they told to freelancer.com is that funds refunded to me, liers",1,"“I make a account on freelancer.com, my user name was...” "
830,"Freelancer.com is such a huge scamming website i have ever encountered. Recently i completed a project with employers full satisfaction and got paid.After about a month, the amount employer paid was reversed back without even letting me know. 

When i emailed freelancer support, they easily replied ""The funds that were used by your employer to pay for your services were disputed through their payment source. This is the reason why the funds that were already transferred to your account were reversed.

We recommend that you contact employer to remind them of their account issue so that your earned funds can be reinstated in your account.""

When i contact employer he wont respond. I am shocked how can freelancer reverse amount paid after a month for the service i provided already? Now who is going to pay for my service? I am never going to use this site again ever!! 

It is not a freelancer's concern if Employers' fund is under dispute or account not verified, freelancer.com should keep that in mind before releasing payment. They cannot simply reverse payment just like that.

I have been using this site for a long time now, but these days they have made the site so inconvenient imposing unnecessary rules and fees. I regret to say freelancer.com has become a huge scamming platform now, if you are new users- please dont use it. There are other freelancing sites that are more safe and secure.

At least they dont ""Reverse payment"" once you complete project successfully.",1,“Freelancer.com is such a huge scamming website i have...”

Employer thought I m not responding and withing 20 minutes of awarding the project declared it incomplete. $153 had been deducted from my account as freelance fee. Very pathetic system, Would never recommend it. At least you should charge when the employer has mad any payment to freelancers.",1,"“I was assigned a project, and while chating with the...” "
839,"You want to use the worlds greatest scamming site, use this site then. Here are the ways they scam their users;

1: They post the fake projects, which when accepted on award to anyone, they charge the 10% of the amount of project and then project poster disappears, as they have hired the people to post the projects for them.

2: If a project is posted, accepted and then done but it completes on the less payment than the agreed amount, then freelancer.com don't care, they will charge you for the payment agreed upfront, however, if the project exceeds the payment agreed, then they will surely care and charges you more for the exceeding payments.

3: The most dangerous way they have starting using is, they post the projects where users are asked to pay a commission/extra payment for the payment transfered to skrill accounts, for such project, poster says he will send you the payment upfront on freelancer.com, and it really happens, When it is done and users then transfers the payment to the posting person's skrill, they will reverse the payment payed to you and so your money will lost what was payed to skrill. They themselves are doing all this, As every thing is in their hands and they can transfer the funds back, so this is why they will pay you upfront and on the next day they will reverse their payment and you will loose your payment.

For such cases, if you will only receive and don't pay to the poster's skrill, even then they will earn, how?... As when you will accept the project, they will charge you 10% upfront, user will pay you and on the next day they will reverse that payment, but will never reverse the transaction on which they have charged you!!!!

So, i would say them worlds greatest scammers and i plan to create a site where i will show the world about their scamming techniques with proofs and pictures.

I have been scammed by them in all the ways described above, so if any one have any doubts, please contact me. Here is my email; mzulfiqar32 at hotmail dot com.

844,"Freelancer does nothing for its users, on the contrary, it seems to be a scam after the next, and after three years I can definitely say: STAY AWAY. It's not just about the money they take in the shape of ridiculous fees (like the exams that promise to boost your sales and look like they were written by a 5 year old), it's how little they care about those feeding their mouths. 90% of the projects are FAKE, everywhere you see people trying to leave contact details (those are projects that you spend credits on, and then they all die in silence because people prefer to leave the site first)... the list would go on and on. I am not just disappointed, I am angry and hurt by how much time I spent trying to make this work as part of my income, and how little I got in return. I left the site last week, moved to PeoplePerHour, and the difference is already abysmal. Freelancer is based on fake projects and cheap contests that hurt the industry. If they cared about their users, they could have a fantastic site. Instead, they scam everyone they can because they know people using the site are in need.

Due to lack of responsibility of the administration and lack of a reliable service structure the site is merely the conglomerate of insane bids and prices activity.
for example this man from the USA holding a contest he asked the freelancers to render 25 stills by the rate of 1$.this is simply impossible by any means.

No ability to negotiate and have suspended accounts with hundreds of dollars in milestones.  This action has caused frustration for both clients, freelancers that were hired and myself.  I will no longer be using the service.

I paid someone to do a job for me. They did it, they were paid for it. I in turn did business with the same individual, they paid me for it. ALL through freelancer. I come to take the funds out and they say the want private documents from me.

The take the money of old project i did   not  once  but FOUR Times !!!!!!!!!!!!.

I also noticed that many user have similar problem,  

1st   They reverse 30$  REASON :  An issue in the employer account !!!!!!  not my account  .
2nd   They reverse 120$  REASON :  An issue in the employer account !!!!!!
3rd   They reverse 500 EUR   !!!!!!!!!!!!  after 3 month of finishing the project  because  An issue in the employer account !!!!!!  

4th  was last week about 700 USD,    THIS IS RIDICULOUS NOW   For  the same reason ,

The  funny part is when you ask about you money they talk  normally ( even it is non sense and not body will accept that )  as this is done because you employer account  is closed or has an issue .  and you can contact your employer and ask him to send to you the money outside freelancer,  
We both know that the employer will not replay for any thing 

if the employer has fraud on them they  will take the money from you 

Freelancer.com if you can't handle that You  should not have to carry the financial burden and loose the money because of fraud action of some employer than take the money from other freelancer ,    

Freelancer should be responsible for their employer and financial transaction 
if you can handle that we can work out side   it is safe for us   
because any project you have done in freelancer   they can at any time take the money from your account   for stupid  reason    (  an issue in the employer account )

also there is no way to check if the employer has an issue of their account 
the employer that they give me the project their accounts was verified and every thing is okay  with many good review of other freelancer 

I will not work any more  unless i take my money back .

i have all the document for all 4 case   as well as the conversation messages . and i will report that everywhere    

STAY away   They don't care about freelancers as they have many of them  so they  will not care about you and you work whatever provisional you are          ,

you can only replay  if i got my money of last milestone   700 USD.   you allready have the my user name  Anasmed",1,“Be Careful  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”

Funny thing is that though they accepted all my documents, my account is still limited so that I cannot withdraw my money. Now they are saying, there are issues with milestone payment of my employer.So my account remains LIMITED for their apparently funny MILESTONE PAYMENT which means nothing at all.

Two recent scenarios

1. Just recently one of my project payment has been reversed due to reason that client did violation of TOS of FL. It happened after around 14 days of project completion and even Feedback was also provided . All money was taken back from my account. I lost the Project Fee as well in this case.

2. I was awarded a project by a client and Project fee was taken from my account, but then client became unresponsive, and I have not received any reply from them for around 10 days now. Here again, I have lost the project award fee.

FL reversed the payment which has been made to my Account, and It was my money and without my consent, it was taken out, that is really great.

FL really need to improve its site structure otherwise its going to loose market very soon with all these loop holes, which favors employers and nothing for Freelancers.

2 worst i am telling you from huge mis behaves form freelancer by the time Australia owned it before that they are much professional
First scene:
i worked for employer in USA California.......he made 2 milestones a $100 and then 200+USD milestones .one he paid me after first demo ...second he paid me then ....client said that work is not that worth so i want almost $100 back to my account and rest you keep and i will email freelancer to limit the budget to that amount i agreed i returned his amount on freelancer and wrote freelancer support in reply what happened my account is limited and suspended and my client all $300+ he paid me reversed to his account and i left with 0 amount plus project fee on that ......still it never come to me even i asked help many times. freelancer help keep on replying client account issue
Second Scene:
Second time an aussie client double cheat me and asked freelancer after he made the payment that  devloper worked with me tries to hack my site and then he made it all okay after i asked him so i donot trust devloper( means me) and i want freelancer to block the devloper profile and reverse my money 
now sad and pathetic freelancer blocked my profile and wihtou any investigation and without my intent they reverse amount from my account and ask me for 1 month suspended account
is this Fair?
One thing more Yearly i am giving freelancer almost 20000USD to 30000USD work 
and they done this to me 
above all their special dept person called me and he is father of all mis behaves and not to understand person 
Bad--- Worst site but i spent over it now 5 years and i want to leave site like anything but which site i join can any one tell me",1,“never trust their support team they are so non professional....” 
870,"We hate these guys with a passion, and we've been with them since they were out of Scandinavia (and decent - at that time they were getafreelancer.com GAF) - BEFORE they became Aussie owned and decided to see how much money they can screw out of everybody.  Their fees are to the point of ridiculous (another site that we use charges a FLAT RATE OF $6.95 PER MONTH and there's no draconian escrow system - how you get paid is between YOU and the CLIENT, like grown ups.) and they keep going up, and the hoops you have to jump through FOR EVERYTHING is even more ridiculous.  I spend more time explaining to clients HOW to make and release payments through them than I do actually working.  

Now in the last couple of months, as if their fees and hoops aren't bad enough, they've decided freelancers can't ask for their initial milestone deposits (our initial milestones are a 33% deposit to cover things like software we have to buy for the client up front) to be released up front, they have to leave them in escrow. So, basically if the client stalls the project - we're out of pocket.  

Their latest control freak trip - is they're complaining about everybody's profile pic/logo - and threatening to terminate our accounts if we don't ""upgrade"" our look.  FYI - OURS IS OUR COMPANY LOGO!

871,"I am a employer that was also duped by freelancer. They will not refund the closing balance that was in my account after I requested them to close my account because of their fraudulent practices. After 4 months they reverse the payment if an employee I paid for their hard work. How does this work after an account has been closed. I did not request for this to be done and I saw in one of the complaints below that a Freelancer employee is claiming that the employer requested it. Now this is one big LIE. I wonder why will they reverse a payment when it was not requested by the employer. And if the account of the employer is closed where does this money goes. Does it just devolve to matter? They are claiming terms and conditions but they are forgetting terms and conditions and any consumer agreement has to be according to law. And the law  clearly describe this practice as stealing.
We have to unite and come as one to make this case stinger to put a stop to the illegal, fraudulent practices of freelancer.com

874,"Working on Freelancer is like dealing with the devil.  You sign up, fill out your skills, bid on some projects, make some money, and everything seems great.  But it's not until you start using it that you find out how they take advantage of you. 

I've been using it now for a couple of years, and while the site's front-end design has gotten snazzier, the service has gotten more and more exploitative.

Firstly, whenever you win and accept a project, YOU the freelancer, have to pay Freelancer.com's share of the commission UPFRONT.  That fee is immediately taken out of whatever payment method you've linked to your account, rather than more reasonable sites do by taking the money out of what you get paid when it's paid.  

What's more, those fees a NONREFUNDABLE.  Meaning, if the employer has you accept the project, and then they cancel for some reason, even if it has absolutely nothing to do with you, you aren't entitled to a refund.  I spoke to them and managed to get a refund when this happened to me once, but I suspect it's not something that's designed to happen regularly.  

Currency conversion--Freelancer ROUTINELY gives me around 5% less for currency conversions than I can get by transferring the money to PayPal and then having them convert it.  Really sleazy.

Freelancer makes it painful to get your money out once you've gotten paid.  Withdrawals only happen twice per week, rather than on-demand.  You can submit a withdrawal request, but it won't be fulfilled for several days.  They actually recommend that you keep as much money as possible on your Freelancer.com balance as possible, to make it ""convenient"" to pay project fees when they are awarded to you.  Yeah, no.  When you carry the money as a balance on the site, they keep it in their bank where it earns interest.

Finally, just to show how much contempt they have for their freelancers, Freelancer.com has this incredibly stupid ""experience point"" system put in place.  You earn ""experience points"" just like in a video game, and these experience points translate into levels, and gaining levels allows you to unlock more features on the site.  They even have little graphic symbols for these various actions, just like a real-life MMORPG.

In my case, they just took back the whole amount after the 2 weeks from the successful completion of the project. When I contacted customer support, they said that it was due to problem with employers payment . 

If you are an employer, you can choose freelancer.com to cheat employees. It is a good choice for you.

Providers bidding on projects,
Almost all providers hire boys to do bidding on their behalf,  these boys job is to copy a pre written text and posted on as a bid on every project. 
If you ever see any one of these bidders online try to ask him any technical question, you will see that either he will logout or will not answer you or will talk to you but will try to change the topic in anyway, and that is why because he does not know anything his job is just to copy some text and paste it in the bid.
We have made a test you too can try it, we posted insult to someone, the title was just insult and the project description also, the funny thing that in seconds there was many bids, also they mentioned in their bid descriptions:  we studied your requirement we .. try it yourself its fun.
We knew that Freelancer reached its 1 million members, a year a go that is after over 15 years of existence, now in one year they reached 13.5 millions that increment  12.5 millions in about a year time, these figures for sure are correct but how?
Because Every provider create 3 to 5 different ids, and why they are doing that?
They bid with all these ids on each project means on one project they very same person will have 5 different bid with 5 different names ids and of course with 5 different bid amounts, they do this to increase their chances to win a project. Also they do this to give their selves reviews .
So when you post a project if you see 50 bids do not be surprise if they are actually just 10 bidders, but each one has made a bid from 5 different ids.
Providers Reviews:
Every providers create about 5 different ids, then they use some of them to post project with a minimum value, which he win it from his other id and give to himself a review, with 5 ids he can guarantee himself lots of reviews that look like they are from different people.
Bidders morals and behaviors:
If you talk or ask any question to any bidder,  then say sorry you are not fit for my job, or you stop talking to him, he will shower you with insults. Its like you talk to me you must hire me.
The end result is Freelancer.com is the worst place ever for anyone wants to get his job done.
their true name is ScamLancers, and the bidders to beggars, and the providers to brokers,
Because who bids and who talk to you is brokering the work, and has no idea about what you are talking about.",1,“Only at Freelancer.com”

In over 40 years I HAVE NEVER HAD A WORSE EXPERIENCE THAN THAT INFLICTED ON OUR FIRM BY FREELANCER.com.

At first I was pleased because of the quality of the work by the artist selected for our project. Then the unauthorized charges started hitting our account. 

I notified PayPal, they are very legitimate, and they worked with us to get at least a partial refund. There were over $900 in unauthorized charges when I filed a dispute. The minute the dispute was filed our account with Freelancer was ""limited."" That led to a cut off in communication with the artist. The project (which was time sensitive) ground to a halt. 

The damage is done. We will never be able to complete the project by the Christmas season. And we LOVED THE ARTIST's WORK. We may have lost $thousands, and in good conscience we will honor our commitment to that artist which will cost even more; but the least we can do is warn you that our experience was horrendous! It's a bloody shame; because if they had dealt ethically we would have continued working with them for years.

But after that client abandoned the project after filing a dispute. Now I am asking freelancer.com support staffs to refund me USD  241.73 as the project fees should now be calculated on milestones released, not on project amount as the project is now abandoned. But they all reply with me same old logic that they don't refund any project fees. And I did worked for this client earlier and got very good reviews from him. So its not a introduction fees any more, its project commission. We already knew each other very well. But freelancer.com support staffs don't understand this and keeps replying me same old statements. I am quite frustrated with this.

So if you accept a project and paid project fees.But after that client does not want to proceed for whatever reason, freelancer won't refund you!!! This is really surprising and surely not a fair practice. I am also surprised that they don't have any such clause in their TOS.

Further update on 27th March, 2015
Freelancer didn't refund me any fees as I mentioned above based on logic that I might have given project files to the client and I just checked with the client he is still unable to find suitable developer. The whole dispute was wrong, client didn't like the design later and started dispute, although he approved the design initially. He delayed the whole delivery because he didn't like the design later on and he can take me to dispute. I told repeatedly about those issues with client to Freelancer, but they never heed to it.

I am staying away from freelancer.com after they acquired vWorker. Firstly, I don't understand the reason why they acquired vWorker, almost all of the freelancers knew about freelancer.com but they didn't use it. It's reason may be various: policies, bidding structure, arbitration, support etc... A lot of people chose vWorker and vWorker really had it's own culture of freelancing.

Once freelancer.com acquired any other already running business, they SHOULD respect the other culture which directly affects thousands of people.

One simple example, I have tons of successfully completed projects and I kept hidden the information about project prices. I have my own reasons to keep it hidden. What happened in freelancer.com? All of my projects' prices are now public and support service says it's impossible to hide them.

If they are not supporting old work culture of vWorker, why did they acquire it?

891,"After many years on freelancer.com they way they do business has changed. They currently stole over $450+ from my account and other freelancers who had worked for me. Blaming it on a chargeback that never went through. Freelancer just kept the money. I hired someone to do some work they didn't do anything and were ill qualified. I went to go file a dispute and their system asked ""how much do you want to pay the freelancer?"" I entered $0 and it told me I must enter a value less then 100%, so they forced me to not enter in a full dispute amount. I entred $1 their system gave me $1 and sent $86 to the freelancer. I then contacted freelancer.com and the freelancer neither one of them would give me my money back after a purposeful deceptive dispute process had tricked me and robbed me of the money. I then field a paypal chargeback at that time freelancer.com deducted $86 from my account and $105 from a milestone I had in escrow for another user. I lost the paypal chargeback and they didnt reflect the money back into my account at this point I had lost $190 and freelancer employess continually put my account at $0 while taking escrow in and prior payment made to other freelancer directly from the freelancers. They never returned the money to me or the freelancers. All in all at the end I had lost $450 directly from freelancer.com accounting employees manually manipulating and altering my account balance data in addition to that I had 2 duplicate charges from thier system on a deposit that was caught later puting a chargeback on that resulted in the same accounting system flaws and theft behavior towards its freelancers and its custoemers that happend prior.

901,"FREELANCER.com is Dangerous - Terms/Requirements change at a moments notice in order to keep your money.

I am a Doctoral Student.  After I did my first project, I terminated the agreement I had between PayPal and Freelancer.  What Freelancer does not tell you is that they will hit your PayPal account with a ""Project Fee"" after the client has paid the money (which includes the project fee) into the Freelancer's ""Escrow Account.""

So Freelancer.com now controls all of the money in the Freelancer's Escrow account, and has removed ten percent of the project fees from his or her PayPal account.  And that fact is not made known to the customer from the beginning.  That is never disclosed to the Freelancer.     

When I contacted customer service with Freelancer, they told me not to worry, future funds would be deducted from the escrow account on Freelancer - but they failed to tell me why the ""project fee"" from the client would be removed from my PayPal if the fee was already in Escrow.

Freelancer.com is scammy, because they take all of the money for your project and lock it down for two weeks (in the beginning) AND charge you the 10% project fee.  So for the first two to three weeks, you lose all of your time, you lose 10% of the project(s) value from your PayPal - and when you want to take out your money (transfer to PayPal) you are hit with secondary and tertiary requirements which were NOT part of the original agreement.

Since I had money in my Freelancer Escrow account to cover any future projects, I cancelled the PayPal agreement with them - for protection.  But then you lose your ""verified"" status - and until Freelancer ""verifies"" you, they keep your money.

WHAT IS VERIFICATION?  ALMOST EVERY PIECE OF PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION YOU OWN.  

Freelancer.com asks for enough information to commit identity theft in your name.  My Bank, the local Law Enforcement and my attorney all said ""THIS IS NOT VERIFICATION, THIS IS AN IDENTITY HARVESTING TECHNIQUE.""

So now I have $500 locked down in escrow, another $375 inbound - which I cancelled, and I am out more than a week of work.

As soon as you get your first project - they will nail your PayPal account for the 10% Fee.  If you terminate the PayPal agreement with Freelancer - even though they can still deposit your funds - you go through another process which will ask you for just about every single personal identity feature you have:

Current photos of you, scans of ID with birthdate, national identity numbers and addresses visible.  Utility bills and bank statements are also requested.

The manager at my bank in the US said ""This is a joke.  Who do these people think they are fooling - this goes far beyond identity verification.""  He told me that Freelancer would have enough information to remove money from my bank account within a matter of minutes.

And if you read the stories on the internet - many people have had their bank account hit by Freelancer - and the same goes with PayPal.  

**CAVEAT EMPTOR**   FREELANCER.COM

Recognize that while you think you are giving your PayPal or Bank Account number to Freelancer for verification, they are going to include all of your personal information as part of your ""user agreement"" with them.  

They are going to claim that you submitting all of your personal information substantiates the fact that you entered an agreement with them to remove money from your Bank Account and/or PayPal Account. This is not disclosed in to new Freelancers.

If you think you are going to cancel your PayPal ""agreement"" with them (whether you knew you ""agreed"" or not) and still have them deposit the money they owe you - Forget it.

Whatever you have earned and have in escrow (a fancy name for your hard-earned money which they are holding from you) - will not be deposited into your PayPal account until you give them ALL of your personal information (which includes all of the info needed to now start nailing your bank account for how much ever they want.

And this is where the dilemma arises.  Do you give them all of your valuable ID (some of which your bank does not even have) in order to get your ""funds"" released from Freelancer ""escrow?""

The other thing is that they will accept money for a project from an unverified employer.  You accept the project, they hit your PayPal account for 10% if they can - and you will never receive a penny - until the unverified employer verifies himself.  

So while it is okay for Freelancer.com to charge your PayPal account 10% for the work you do, and it is okay for them to take money from an ""unverified"" employer and hold it in your ""escrow (LOL),"" they will never release the funds to you from an ""unverified"" employer - the funds are held for ""security"" issues.

So while Freelancer feels ""secure"" enough to take money from unverified employers and to charge your PayPal account 10% for the ""project fee"" for the unverified employer, you will never see a penny of that money unless the employer self-verifies.

If you contact customer service (after Freelancer has charged your PayPal 10%) they will claim that the problem needs to be resolved between the unverified employer and you - the Freelancer.  And all the while they have the money you earned - plus the 10% they removed from your PayPal account.  If the employer does not self-verify - you lose the money you earned - plus the 10% Project Fee and all of the time you put into completing the project.

In the US we call this ""Bait and Switch.""  Freelancer.com changes the terms of service (or hides them from the Freelancers) once money has been received.  If Freelancer ran their business the way it looks on the surface, it would be awesome.

Freelancer.com has their system set up to make the inflow of money very easy, but forget about taking the money out of your Freelancer.com ""escrow"" without giving them every single personal identity detail about yourself.

As a world traveler - their ""verification"" requirements constitute a huge security risk to me.  Photos of myself, holding my ID, scans of my ID's and photocopies of my bank statements?

E-Bay and PayPal have a pretty efficient verification system.  But it appears that Freelancer.com waits until your ""escrow"" account is built up with them, and then they hit you with additional requirements to get the money you earned (while it generates interest for them). And those requirements are so detailed that the average person will forgo receiving their hard-earned money in order to maintain some level of privacy with their personal information.

Freelancer.com is very well set up and thought out - for the Freelancer executives who want to get ahold of your hard-earned money.  It looks great at the beginning, but good luck retrieving any of the money you made while simultaneously preserving the security of your personal information.

In a way it is like blackmail.  Freelancer basically says ""give us all of your personal information or we keep your money.""

Freelancer just set up shop in Canada - so hopefully Canadian authorities will look into this b/c Bait and Switch with TOS is illegal in North America.  There is no disclosure with Freelancer.com.  The true TOS emerges when they have the funds from a few of your projects tucked neatly into your ""escrow"" account.

When you log into your Freelancer account, look at the balance at the top of your Profile Page.  That amount in ""escrow"" is really the amount of money you lost for doing those projects (in addition to the 10%).

UPDATE:  August 10 - I filed complaints with scamwatch of Australia and IC3.gov in the USA.  This company has just opened a branch in SW Canada and are now under jurisdiction of Canadian Law.

The way Freelancer.com changed their TOS with Freelance workers AFTER funds have been deposited in their accounts is against US and Canadian Law.",1,“FREELANCER.com is Dangerous”

Now when i tried to withdraw my earned funds i got message from support that there is an issue with my client's account so that withdrawal can not be processed.

904,"Terrible site. I joined hoping it would be better than Elance, but it's possibly worse. Bottom-of-the-barrel job prices, you have to pay to do skills testing, and if you want to bid on jobs within more than one category, you need to pay for that 'privilege.' They obviously don't care about attracting or retaining professionals because of the awfulness of the jobs posted. 

Freelancer isn't concerned with providing safe, secured, reputable employment to professionals at all. Instead, they only care about scraping their percentage off of the millions of poor-paying jobs that do go through their site. Like ""$20 for writing 150 300-word articles. If I don't like your writing, I fire you.""

Uhh, gee. What a great working environment! Don't you want to pay for the privilege of bidding on that fruitful opportunity?

There are so many unserious clients looking to pay nothing for professional-level work and so many people who are asking for spec work, and from what I know about the site, Freelancer does nothing to deter this.

After I signed up, I immediately started receiving emails almost hourly from them and because this was annoying, I wanted to change my email settings, but Freelancer doesn't let you do this unless you verify your phone number. I didn't want to give them my phone number so I emailed them, and they pressed for my phone number. I said I now wanted to cancel my account.

Guess what? You can't! There is no way to delete my account and after multiple emails to freelancer staff, they are still refusing to do so, and telling me that they'll ""keep it open in case you want to return."" 

It's an unprofessional site that wastes your time and money. Avoid.",1,“Terrible site” 
905,"Since one year I was registered on this site that allows you to earn with a pay per project system. This website (www.freelancer.com) is managed by such a Matt Barrie, Australian entrepreneur. At the end of a project, the employee receives the money in his account, less a percentage retained on the site. I made in a year and a half 3 projects in my spare time, for a total of 710$ dollars and with the 3rd project I got the possibility to withdraw the money (lower limit is 500$).

First withdrawal request was delayed of 15 days by default and was canceled. Before making the second request I asked precise details to freelancer because I wanted to use the wire transfer.

After I sent the request freelancer found a reason to cancel it: missing informations. When I sent all informations correctly my account has been limited due to 'security reason', for 'antiterrorism' and 'anti-money laundering' fraud. It required me to pass a security document review process.Procedure was suspected, because for sending money on the platform there is no verification. Money come in easily but does not come out from the platform.

In full confidence, I have uploaded the scan of ID card, copy of the contract with my bank to proof my address, a photo of me with the identity card in my hand in high resolution and I also answered to a question: why I connect from a different location respect to my address written on the document: Simply, I'm in vacation, and I use a different connection.

After a few hours I received an email inviting me to send further informations, as well as the information of my profile have to march with my profile (they match, just Country is different due to my old mobile number), a coloured copy of the bank contract (the bank is online and they sent to me just a black and white copy, they can't do more). I'm a student and I do not have any bills with my name and address, I live with my parents. They asked me why I'm connecting with proxy or VPS, they want another hi-res photo and contract with my bank has to be 'coloured'. Very good in fantasy stories. Despite my e-mails to customer service, everything was designed to block the withdrawal.

After a quick search on the internet, I've found a lot of cheated persons. Identity theft, theft of banking data extremely sensitive, high-resolution pictures with ID card in my hand and over $700 of mine unlawfully retained without permission or license granted by a credit institution or financial intermediation. I gave them 24 hours to solve the problem but they didn't care of my mail so I got to the police of my country and opened a law proceeding. I also advised mastercard, visa, paypal and skrill payment processors of the fraud by attaching the law proceeding and advised my bank of the fraud, filing a report with all data sent. Next step will be an enquiry to the international credit institutions for stopping this not-legal fraud (contract they show on website is not valid and full of illegal statements, they are not a bank).",1,“Since one year I was registered on this site that allows...”

Today, I am feeling shame to complain freelancer.com even i earned 550 reviews. I am working in freelancer.com since 5 years, but why they try to cover their loss from service provider. We are providing E-book writing services in freelancer.com. We are working in freelancer.com because it is regulated by ACCC. Now a days freelancer.com is technically stopped people payments to cover their own loss.  We wrote book and handover it to our client from freelancer.com message box. 
I want to withdraw my $800 that earned from this book that we have written for our client and client also paid via freelancer.com. But freelancer.com stopped our payment even project was closed and they cancelled our withdrawal of  $800 because freelancer.com is saying that we have the issue with your client credit card company. 
Is it my duty to verify the client identity and credit card extra? Why freelancer.com stopped our $800 and refused to pay us. We are students and writing to collect our fee and also compromise in our studies. After putting too much effort then nothing in our hand. Freelancer.com holds our $800.
Please it is requested to strictly discuss these payments issue with freelancer.com. Why they are transferring their loss in service provider. Why they charge too much gold membership fee if they cannot secure our payments. Is it not a mental torture? I have also sent an email to ACCC.

I have an account on this website for almost a year, used it to freelance and to work with freelancers.

The last job I did was for $1000, I was hired as a web developer for 3 weeks, developed a web shop for a client. 

I completed the project and the client released the money on 19th of July. It became available on my account, so I passed all the source files of the webshop to a client.

Straightaway I submitted $1300 (had $1350 on my account) for the withdrawal which was supposed to happen on Monday (21st of July). I was on the Freelancer website on Sunday, had $1350 as before, but when I logged in on Monday, I realized that $1000 just vanished from my account. All signs of the project were deleted, the account of the employer closed.

I wrote to the support and they told me that the money my employer used came from a questionable source, so they were returned to the originator. 

The project was initiated by the employer on the 30th of June, the money ($1000) were submitted as a milestone payment THE SAME day. Freelancer decided that money came from a questionable source the moment when money were supposed to be withdrawn. So they were very comfortable to use them for 3 weeks and when it came to paying, they decided to question the employer and blocked his account...Now they suggest to contact employer, os that he pays outside the website! Seriously? When THEY allowed the milestone to be submitted and the project to be finished, the source files submitted to the employer?!

Thank you FREELANCER.com for using 3 weeks of my life, charging me $100 and taking $1000 from my account!

917,"I wish I had googled before... So here comes my personal horror story:
I just finished my first 200$ project and requested a withdrawel. For some ""security issue"" the first payout is delayed for 3 weeks (although it doesn't seem to be an issue to take my money immediately). Ha, of course, it got cancelled! I didn't even requested everything and left a bit, but won two big projects, wich freelancer booked from my account, so there was not enough left to make the withdrawel (remember: it's only a ""security issue"" to PAY you, TAKING your money is no problem). However, the projects were payed, i get 5-star ratings by my customers, but freelancer of course did not activated the old withdrawel, I needed to make a new one, again delayed for 3 weeks. So I am yet not paid for my first project wich was finished 5 weeks ago now.

But it could get even worse: On the billing site I saw an advertise, that users should verificate their account. As an honest freelancer that seemed legit to me and I started the verification process voluntary.
They have been sent 6 (in words: SIX!!!) photos of letters, wich do all apply to their terms, showing all my as well as the senders information. But guess what? That is not enough, although in their FAQ and their terms&conditions is stated that this is enough! It is nowhere mentioned, so I say thats a lie, but they insist they need to see the full documents, which are (in the first try) my bank statement and a letter from my healthinsurance. Are they INSANE? By the way: they never tell you why they reject it and just send you a $#*!ty auto-reply with no informations leaving you clueless, as long as you don't ask at least 4 times to give you a hint, what the problem is.
They further rejected: full document photos from letters of my bank, one with no private information, one with a pencil covering the part after the ""THIS IS YOUR PIN: "" (yeah, for sure, I will just give you my online-banking pin, I just read all this positive feedback here and totally trust you...), a full letter from my landlord (ha, no proof! your landlord doesn't know for sure where you are living! You just rented that appartment to fool us!).
They recommend to send some bills from utility services, but seriously: are they living in the 1990's? None of them, not a single one, absolutly no one of my utility services send printed out letters! Most of them even made the contract via mail.

I wonder that they approved my mug-shot with the ID and did not request some naked photos ""to make sure my head is not photoshoped on"" (come on, be creative! you can invent some additional requirements spontaneously whenever you want!) as they are so very interested in the most private things.

Now I'm stuck in an endless loop with morons from the so called ""support"", wich obviously can't read and just closed the ticket. Okay, to be fair: maybe they can read, but just not explain, why freelancer is violating their own terms and conditions.

-----UPDATE-----
Problem solved: I'm finally verificated with a pdf. That is just grotesque, because that would be, compared to all the photos mentioned above, really easy to fake. The FAQ says clearly scan or photo. Too, this secret (?) solution came just when it was too late anyway to request a withdrawel before that delayed first one... Wich wasn't even my main intention, but it's a bit to bearish, don't you think? This is long enough, but there are some more details that clearly shows it's to get a runaround. More than two weeks in wich I spent hours on that, countless mails to your support and at last a solution that could have been given in answer to my very first mail?

As long as you can't refund stolen time or compensate it with my usual hourly fee I will not revoke that voting. And don't tell the feedback is ""appreciated"", when it's obviously the same problem for years! Shouldn't you just improve the customer service for every user of your site, than wasting time by searching the web and only react to those who complain in public? Btw: it's too late, when customers are already really angry and felt to be taken for a fool, that's not a very smart strategy...

First of all in every transaction the freelancer keeps a big percent of your money and when you ask to send your money, the time period can be up to 30 days!!! The reason for this late, it is that is for your safe!!! (???)

Our story start when we send 500 euros, to our account, for a project, via Bank transfer, and after the project cancellation, before we start, we asked the money back, but this time, via our pay pal account.

The freelancer, blocked our money, after 2 years, cooperation, as an suspected money laundering, because, we send money via bank transfer, and after cancelation, of the project, we ask the money back. 
(we speak about, for only 500 euros...Imagine, money laundering with 500 euros, is just ridiculous).

Now, for unblock our account,  the freelancer.com, ask to us, to send  photo with an number that they send to us (like a prisoner - photo with mumber),my identity ( ID), my drive license, billing phone account, to show my address, etc. 

Also we must explain why we sent the money via Bank transfer and why  we asked to take it back... those money,from paypal, our answers was, ""ok you can sending it back to our bank, where they came from, no problem"",  
Note, that they don't accept the cancelation reason(project cancellation)
So, with goodwill, we sent all these information requested... 
The freelancer.com was not accepted any of these documents, that we send, and they asked to sending again, New photo, My ID ( again), official translate from my phone account (with official translator) etcetcI repeate, that all this was for 500 euros... The ""suspected money laundering""was for ONLY 500 euros.... 

- Today, I went and I spoke with the police (cybercriminal department, in Greece) to complaint against, those scammers.( Freelancer.com)
The police told me that they use the law of their country (Australia) and they cannot do something. 
Eventually, simple we will waste 500 euros, that we had in our account, because we are not Australian citizen, and we can't do NOTHING.

I am just asking this as Intentionally I did not post email ID to client but by mistakes as that client was with us in communication in past and I just mentioned in chat window like this ""I have send email to you with ID: XYZ@XYZ.COM"" and he replied back yes received mail and then I mentioned to client that we will deal through freelancer.com only for this project and he agree also.

A guy first posted a job and I bid on it, after that he says he will pay me only Inr 30 on each article and I was like hell no, I'm not working for you then so he goes on to abuse me, use crass language and I can't block him, nothing. I reported him to Freelancer and his a/c is still active and he keeps posting jobs.
Another a/c got me to work for him and refused to make an initial payment and then he made me write for him and refused to pay for it! He just blocked me off and now there is no way I can take any compensation.
Another freelancer gave me a job, I got charged 10% and then he makes me write one and later says that this was not what we were looking for (without giving me any prior info) and then he offers to pay for the freelance fee and not for the work I did.
My advise, keep away from this website, it's bad news people!",1,“Horrible horrible website”

Even worse, the employer is not responding at all. He had asked me to connect with another person for work while he will take care of only payments but now none of them are responding. I have messaged the employer several times but without any response. Would freelancer return the deducted money if the employer doesn't pay? Why is freelancer deducting money from freelancers accounts when they haven't earn a penny. I feel like cheated. I thought it was free to bid as was written all over but if the employer is the actual payer, shouldn't freelancer take initial deduction from them rather than from a freelancer who hasn't even earned a penny? I am really frustrated with the system even at start. There is no way a freelancer gets security? Now launching a dispute is the option suggest but with a precaution that it should be last resort. Now how long should a freelancer wait for it to become last resort? If employer is not responding, how long should one wait? What about the money already deducted? Will they credit it back?

929,"Yes, I created an account with them about 1 year ago (sort of) and I've never used, for most of my freelance jobs are here in the UK;  Until the other week when I decided to give it a go and try the web site. 
I have to say it's very cool how it resembles a video game, with all the achievements, badges and many interesting items like exams and other things.
I've noticed that they charge you fees for almost everything (that is ok,   it's business after all) but right now, I'm having some problems with my first costumer as he is relinquish to pay me even the first milestone, even though is just the 40% ahead.  
It put me off the fact that this guys are not even ""fully verify"" and I reckon is just another bloody ""thief"" who wants the work for free. Don't get me wrong, I know that 70% of the people out there are the same (its a tough world) but I find frustrating that even with all those gadgets of yours, you cannot give me protection in this case.  Not here just to criticise but I would like to give some suggestions, for example:
1.- Frelancer.com should not allow an ""unverified"" client to even create a bid on the first place.
2.- As soon as I accepted the bid, these guys took my money from my Pay-pal account, It would be just fear if you develop some kind of gadget that also takes the first milestone from the client into the freelancer account. That would make me feel more protected/secured. but regardless all the cool gadgets they've got, freelance.com is not offering me much more security that the average freelance job I can find on the streets  

Seems to me that all this game works out nicely for them, but for us is the same battle as always. I really wish you could come back to me with some ideas or advises so I can keep your account, hoping to have an easier/Safe journey with you guys. 
(after I sent this email to Freelance, they answer me back with a very polite email as they are ""very happy to keep me account"" but no answer regarding my issues, not sure what to do)",1,"“Yes, I created an account with them about 1 year ago...” "
930,F*ck this site.. eaten up my $954 and saying due to security issues.. I will make sure all my clients charges back... A^sholes are earning money in these ways. Stop cheating and send ur daughters sisters and moms to whores den and earn money in a better way,1,“F*ck this site..” 
931,"Crazy,

I got bills for about 1350eur and I don't know why since the site says my expenses amount to 890. 

Furthermore, two weeks ago I had to have a refund for 200$. Never got that money.",1,“Crazy” 
932,"The website blocks the funds of the service provider / freelancer only if a single client / employer files a reversal of a 'released' milestone. The client does not get anything but the freelancer is deprived of what he had earned from project. In addition, the website had already charged 10% which do not get refunded.  This is exactly how it happened:

1. The project was under dispute, but I had won it and received the funds corresponding to the project value.
2. We closed the project, and the funds were added to the freelancer.com account.
3. A few days later, the funds corresponding to that project (around 130) were deducted from my account. I filed half a dozen complaint. Every time, I get the same response - 'The employer has filed a reversal, and she is the only one who can reverse it. We are not involved in your mutual business.'

That practically means that the buyer thinks he has the right to get the work done, and then file a reversal to get 100% refund of what he had earlier paid - even ages after project was done.However, even he does not get the funds. This eventually results in buyer and seller thinking that the other has funds, while it is the website which gets away with the funds.

I joined the website in 2011. By 2012 end, I was so much fed up with the website that I started using elance instead. I had lost around $600 (this is direct loss, indirect was that of cancellation of $2,500 project because I had stopped working on freelancer.com). 

Later, I started getting mails and remainders that they miss me, there are new security features and improvements etc., and finally I again joined in 2014. It turned out to be the old wine in new bottle.

I do not understand the following:

1. What is the purpose of this 'reversal' feature? Is it to help freelancer.com increase its profits through reversed funds (which are neither with contractor nor client)?

2. From my point-of-view, I delivered a service to a client, who has completed the payment. What he had paid is now my money. Is it reasonable for freelancer.com to expect its members to chase their past clients to be able to recover the funds?

3.  The only reason why I use freelancer.com is that it is supposed provide a milestone service which ensures that the website will ensure clients' funds are paid to service provider if he delivers the project properly. However, if there is no reliability of milestones or account balance, what is the benefit of using the website?

4. Is it legal for a website to deduct the balances of its members on the basis of some 'reversal' feature? (To this, I got the answer that the website reserves the right to reverse any transaction between buyers and sellers. It is similar to amazon.com justifying the buyer's act of buying something from amazon.com, using it and then claiming a refund from seller.  Having such terms and conditions is not a legal practice)

5. The client does not have the funds because she has already released them. I do not have the funds. So, where is the money?

I never got the answer to these questions (except for q4, but again it was not justified).",1,“The website blocks the funds of the service provider...”

Why do they need to know my birthday?  My phone number?   Their profile compilation is limiting and short sighted.  

I'm totally blowing them off.  I HAD to do one star - it won't let me leave them blank",1,“wow” 
938,"Where should i start...1st. About nonreturnable fee is just one of stupid ""hole"" in Freelancer.com policy. As i suggested i can simply create a fake account and then post a project for $2000-$3000 and go away. Result - freelancer looses $100-$150 ( if he has a standard membership) . Why would i do that to someone -could be simple reasons like i don't like a competitor . Would i do or done this personally on Freelancer.com - NO!! Was this done to me - YES!! and 4-5 times now. Thankfully it wasn't for that much and only lost $10,$20 and $5....
Here comes number 2 ! 1 week ago i was scammed out of $600 and Freelancer.com got even paid for it $30 fee, which they did not refund! Here is how it happened....As usual i posted a bid on one of projects and got contacted by client. He explained everything , but said that needs to get files from designer and then i can complete the job. Without any back thought i agreed to pay their designer through Skrill system and in return client paid in on Freelancer.com . Seemed nothing wrong. Next day my account goes -$600 and that money were returned to original client. Why?? As i found out later he was a fraudster and stole that money by hacking or whatever someone on Freelancer.com ...so support from Freelancer decided to take my money and give it back to fraudster and closed his account. Then they kept writing to me things like - contact your employer to get your money back, because i did supply them with all evidence of our conversations and all transactions through Skrill and Freelancer. The question is HOW THE HELL I CAN CONTACT HIM if you blocked and closed his account and what good it will do to me. YOU reversed supposedly irreversible payment and gave it back to him ( my honestly earned money) and most funny thing - you DID NOT refund my fee. So in the end i paid to get scammed on Freelancer.com....After looking very thoroughly in their policy and rules i sure can see that us freelancers are not protected in any way and all and we can get scamed or ripped off at any time and only winner here will be Freelancer.com. 
Well, i can tell you without hesitation - YOU A DISGRACE TO HUMANITY! You protect fraudsters and scamers and don't care about any of us - freelancers. Freelancer - people who make your site possible and who making you millions of $$$ by paying monthly fees and project fees and what you did in return to protect those very same people - NOTHING!! Your policy is a joke and has so many ""holes"" that for fraudsters this is like a heaven. I wish i was one of them myself now and did not have to work so hard every day. 
I don't want to paste here all your "" stupid"" responses from tier 2 management - too long, but i can see that some of those people got that job not through brain in their head for sure ! It may sound a bit rude , but its a fact and i am sure after reading this , you will realize that i have full right to say that. 
In the end your support still did not even refund $30 fee from fraud project, so you getting paid for this is actually making you an Accessory to Fraud, because you GOT paid for someone scamming me out of $600 and thanks to your ""stupid"" and full of ""holes"" policy he even got his money back for it. 
In the end - i worked through Freelancer.com for 1.5 years and already have a nice profile with a lot of reviews, because i don't sit around. I managed to get over 40 regular clients, who i may add i made pay always through freelancer system - wanted to be honest, but of cause could get paid through many other means and wouldn't have to pay 5% fees!!! Now, i will go to a different site and take all my clients with me - very disappointed in Freelancer.com . I am not going to scream that they are cheaters and scamers, but in my case they are accessory to fraud. Will i sue them - don't know yet, will have to figure out the costs and other things 1st. In the end fact is - they sure not preventing any type of fraud to happen to any of us .... So, think twice before you get yourself set up on Freelancer.com and be sure you ready to get stressed and cheated out one way or another. Freelancer.com is a paradise for fraudsters - FACT!!! Be aware - be VERy aware of this site !!!",1,“Where should i start...”

 I had a person who wanted some work done.
I did the work for him, he paid me the money.

Now after around 30 days Freelancer realises that the money was from a account which was fake so they just reverse the money back to the employers account.

Why should the employer get back the money ? I worked for him, he paid me now its me who should get the money, but no, the money goes back to him.

Freelancer's useless STAFF says that the account is closed and that I should contact the employer directly to receive money from him. Why will the employer pay me if he is getting the work done for FREE ?

They say their STUPID POLICY states that if the account cannot be verified then the money goes back to the employers card. IS FREELANCER for us or for EMPLOYERS ?
Why dont you create a website EMPLOYERS.com instead ?

They say Freelancer money system is the best and most trusted, my foot i think its the worst system. Even paypal listens to disputes more clearly and gives a decision which is technically right.

Marcus, why are you lieing here, you hadnt solved my issue. Until you give my payment, I wont leave you guys. You cant steal my money. 

Second UPDATE----
Marcus is doing nothing here just showing off that site is genuine. But he says same thing what others. So dont think your issue will be solved here..
I havent any contact detail of employer except email. And after sending seven emails in 14 days, not a single reply. And cheater freelancer says they dont have money with him. I need my money MARCUS. Read it with open eyes. I already contacted my lawyer and he says it is a very tough case to sue such a company outside of INDIA. But I already swear that I will teach you a lesson. 
I AM WARNING you last time that if you wont credit my account for that project, get ready to see the result. You have to pay me at any cost. 

UPDATE---
LOOK ALL REVIEWER. MARCUS HADNT EVEN REPLIED TO MY MESSAGE. BECAUSE HE DONT HAVE ANY EXCUSE. 

Freelancer.com is now trying to steal your money. I had completed a job few days before and employer completed the review too. Then next day suddenly my account balance goes -272$. Review is also deleted from the profile. That is not the matter. 

Main issue is there is milestone created since 3 days and they dont have time to review the card details, and when project is done, they simply reverse the amount(OR MAYBE THEY EAT THAT THEMSELVES and no notification at all for this non-sense.

HEY MARCUS, WHAT IS THIS? YOU HADN'T EVEN REFUND MY FEES UNTIL I ASKED THAT. And also there is no notification for this. I just saw that and busted you thieves. 

And when asked for refund, you said we cant do that. Contact employer. It is 3 days he hadnt replied too. 

SO, EITHER SEND MY MONEY OR WE PLANNED TO HIRE A LAWYER AND FILE A DISPUTE AGAINST FREELANCER.COM PTY LTD. If I dont get my money.

Also I told that give me one month golden membership instead.

SO, I hadnt left any option for them, till now they saying same thing - To contact employer. I wont left you cheater. 

It may be small amount for you, but I need full amount refunded. It is our hard earned money.

And MARCUS-- If you cant give any solution than same robotic reply and sympathy, give me the freelancer address. I will file a dispute against you guys. This time I wont left you......",1,“Third update”

Just looking at the comments just shows how unreputable they are!",1,"“I bidded and then got offered a job, I accepted” "
949,"This is really frustrating and very irritating issue with freelancer which I recently faced.

They simply deducted payment done by an employer earlier for some project and on top of that they did not even care to notify me for this deduction. I was one day just looking on my transactions when I saw that reversal transaction. I would have lost that money altogether if I would not have looked at my transactions. And the reason given was that my employer who had already paid me earlier, now has some issues with their account because of which my money is deducted now. Isn't it frustrating? Why do I have to care about issues with other people's account? Now, these guys are even not telling me what issue that other guy has with their account because of which my money is deducted. They just say: ""Your employer has some issues with their account, so we deducted your money"". Why? It sounds like, they are punishing me for somebody else's mistake. This is the whole case step by step:
1. I worked for some employer.
2. Employer was happy with my work.
3. So he gave me good rating and released the payment in around march.
4. Now in April, I was just going through my transaction.
5. I came across this weird transaction: Reversal of money was done.
6. I asked support people. First of all their support desk is really pathetic. They are just sitting there to waste your time. They do not know anything. They will simply ask you to ask someone ask for your problem. Finally, after much of problem, what I finally got is:
They: ""Your employer now has some issues with their account""
Me: I asked what issues do they have:
They: ""This we can not tell you"".
Me: ""Then I said that this is wrong. You guys took my money without any notification, you should atleast give me proper reason.""
They: Sorry, if you want to get your money back, then ask your employer to resolve issue with their account. 

So basically it meant that  I have to now beg my employer to resolve issue with their account so that I can get my money back which I earned by working hard on a project and Freelancer just took it without any $#*!ing issue from my side and even without giving any $#*!ing notification.

Now, somehow I managed to convince my employer to resolve issue with their account. He said he did that. But I have not received my money back still. Freelancer so called support people still say that employer has not resolved issue with their account and employer says that he resolved. 
I just do not understand why the $#*! I am in this issue and why my money is taken.

Because of this I really wonder how many times these guys might have done this earlier. I dont have any idea how much money I lost this way.

I have many other issues which I would like everyone to know, so that other people do not fall in their trap. Freelancer.com is really a big fraud. They will just take your money which you earned by working hard on projects without any reason. I will highly recommend everyone, please not to use this website. They are $#*!ing fraud.

I am in the process of setting up a blog to write all the frauds by freelancer.com. If anyone want to contribute to the blog and want to escalate the issues, please contact me. 
I want to take this to some serious people and I want to escalate these issues. We should really do something to stop this SCAM. I have lost money so times on this site. This is just of the frauds I have faced. I have many more to discuss.

950,"These guys are total fraud. I have been trying to take my money out for about one month. I have tried for about 4-5 times and each time they create some issue and then they cancel my withdrawal. 

I am already in loss of around 500$ because of these guys. I will not recommend anyone to use this site to get work. I am thinking of writing a big blog post regarding the problems that I have faced with freelancer.com and I will also put at least 100$ in promoting that blog post so that this cheater site freelancer.com do not cheat other people.

952,"UPDATE: I was finally able to get reply from a client for this project. They say they did not receive their money back, so where is it then? Also one of support workers at freelancer.com told me that they had to give a chargeback because it was an hourly project. What a joke.

When I started on freelancer.com, some 3 years ago, it was a good website to find projects and earn decent money. Now, my latest project was the complete nightmare. Client decided to throw insults as soon as I have completed the work we agreed upon. Then said they won't pay and how I ruined their website.

After trying to calm things down for over a week, which was longer than what project lasted, I decided to go for arbitration and paid $12 in fees just for that. Some 4 days later I got an email saying that client has released the funds (funds were in milestone) and that I have won the dispute. Even got XP for that, which I find extremely useless. Went to withdraw funds, only to receive another email that withdrawal was cancelled. I checked my funds on freelancer.com and it was all there. I have sent an e-mail to their support asking what's going on.

This same day, several hours later, money was gone from my account, with no explanation whatsoever. What's worse I suddenly have a negative balance, so where did that come from? I tried sending another e-mail to freelancer.com support and got no reply. So once this negative balance has been resolved I will most likely close my account there and focus on other sites that give support to both freelancers and employers.

I have contacted live support here is the summary: I won the dispute but due to the payment being made as milestone the client was entitled to get a chargeback. They released money to my account, charged me 10% fee then took money and gave it back to the client. I am done with freelancer.com, cancelled my membership and opened a dispute for arbitration fee. This is beyond belief.",1,“UPDATE: I was finally able to get reply from a client...” 
953,"Horrible site. They have buttons after you post a project to trick you into posting it again (and pay again). And they charge you without letting you know for every tiny thing you do (sometimes even without me actually entering the site at all).

957,"unfortunately what i had read is correct, before 1 year ago freelancer had suspended our account ""foxytechnology"" by saying emlpoyer is not happy, 

we had provided all the proof , skype chats , app codes, apk , ipa, database, server side , which prooves we had worked 3 months and the app was done with great quality, 

employer keeps asking add things on the projects and we did, but when once he asked to add BIG feature on taxi project, and we refused, he just email freelancer and requested that he wants his released money back, 

here is the freelancer policy
-i had sended all the proof to the support team, 
-all files .apk , .ipa and the codes which was on client server.
-freelancer didnt looked on it and they just suspended our account
-according to freelancer they found we had not finished the job,
-Unfortunately , i had showed freelancer the app done by us and approved by apple and play store, 
-still freelacer said we had not completed job and closed our heavy rated account.

i emailed this 100 times to freelancer, but seems they dont care about the developers, 

my question is , does closing freelancer account is solution, 
-i think human beings have brain to investigate things properly, but i am not sure people sitting at the tier 2 of freelancer has used their brains to check the codes apk and ipa.

freelancer is only for those people who do scams and frauds, you can see 100 of people have incomplete project reviews , why freelancer dont take action on them, 

i really dont understand their policy,

969,"Hi, I recently made the mistake to use freelancer.com for the first time to hire someone to complete a project for us. The freelancer was a scammer and a very good one. He made me pay a deposit before doing any work and once I had made the payment he disappeared. Freelancer.com was very unhelpful and refused to do anything about it. I then posted feedback about the freelancer to at least warn others and this was not posted. He was also wearing a freelancer.com Tshirt in his profile picture, which made me think he was a trustworthy member. Even though I have made a complaint along with several other employers about this specific freelancer he is still verified on freelancer.com I would definitely never use this site again and have asked them to close my account and refund the milestone credit I have.",1,"“Hi, I recently made the mistake to use freelancer.com...” "
970,"Hello,

first of all: You have to differ between the website and what you see there and a project that's gone south. The website can't help you with the latter and it's not their fault.

So I'm using freelancer.com for a few days now, had two jobs and could literally watch how my money dissappeared. This sucks.

I got all my money in USD to send some of it to my PayPal account it had to be exchanged to Euro. Of course to an exchange rate that's not even near the exchange rate a local bank would offer.

After clicking OK I read that my withdrawal has been delayed for 15 days because of reasons for security. Ok, first withdrawal seems to be delayed, I can live with that.

Two days later I had another job and the moment I clicked accept, they collected their project fee which is usually 3 $currency or 10% depending on what is higher.

Sadly the project was in GBP. So they had to exchange some of my money to GBP again and did that. But they didn't use money that was in my funds, they took it from the 60 Euros that have been waiting for withdrawal and to be sent to PayPal. They also took 3.5GBP instead of 3GBP.

So what happened now was:

- I paid 3.5 GBP instead of the 3 GBP that are listed in the terms of service.
- They did an exchange at an exchange rate that's not funny
- They stopped my withdrawal because it had unsufficient funds now

So I had to go back. Stop the withdrawal and ended up with 55.54 Euro. To be able to withdraw the money again I had to exchange it to dollars again to get other money out of my account too because you can't withdraw if the amount of the money that you try to withdraw is below 30 in the currency you like to withdraw it. (Yeah, right ...)

So my money has been exchanged again, again at a rate that isn't funny. Now I have 130 USD left from a starting 185 USD.

I wonder if I'll see any money at all after writing here...

Another interesting thing is: If you take one of those tests it always costs 5 $currency where $currency represents your primary currency set in the settings. So it costs 5 USD or 5 AUD or 5 GBP or 5 EURO. That's scam. 

The fact that those tests are just a bunch of $#*! is another scam. In some tests questions have been completely out of context or you had the feeling you're doing an english test during one of the network tests. Really really bad stuff.

After reading a few of the comments here and my own experience in the last 4-5 days I'm not really sure I want to work with this website anymore.

Their user support is kinda non existend. No reply, no questions answered nothing. 

You can't even get most information in their help section. It's just not there. And how the rating is done if you possible get the job or not isn't explained anywhere either. It's kinda like somebody throws the dice and that's it.

Let's see if I get my money or if I hit the same sh*t others here did.

974,"Extremely bad experience with this site.
I got offered a translation project through their site but it turned out it was a completely fake. Freelancer.com took NO PRECAUTIONS to check the validity of the project or the user who posted it. However, they had no problem charging me with 15$ just for clicking accept in order to view project details. When I submitted an issue ticket with them, they COMPLETELY IGNORED IT - I received an automated response acknowledging the receiving of the ticket, then they LIMITED MY ACCOUNT so that I could no longer work on any project (WHY THE HELL DO YOU LIMIT MY ACCOUNT IF I SUBMIT A TICKET WITH YOU??!!!??). I never received a response about my ticket and I found that they just closed it some two weeks later without informing me - I found out because they had audacity to send me another automated email asking me to participate in the survey about their handling of the ticket. YOU DID NOT HANDLE MY TICKET, you ignore it. Please, put that option into your survey and I will maybe participate in it.
Anyway, they completely wash their hands from everything because in their terms it says 'they only help freelancers to meet with employers and for that they take the commission'. Well, guess what, this goes both ways. If you are allowed to take my money for 'helping me to meet an employer' (in reality, tricking me into clicking Accept button on your site in order to view the project details), then YOU ARE ALSO UNDER OBLIGATION, according to your EXACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS, to provide EXACTLY what you PROMISE: putting me in contact with an EMPLOYER, not some random, unchecked user.
Any honest company would simply RETURN the money (what would eBay do if I advertised selling a car and then just emailed buyers with a .jpg image of a Toyota?). This goes double in the case where NO ACTUAL MONEY HAS EVER LEFT THEIR HANDS. What I mean is, there was no money sent to third parties. It was freelancer.com that took money from me (and supposedly also from the fake employer) and said money is still with them. There were no services or costs where that money was spent and is now difficult to return. They could easily say 'sorry for not checking the employers background but since no money ever left our hands and no service was rendered to you (except clicking on a button), we now reimburse you'. But things do not work that way with freelancer.com. Please note that the only ones profiting from this system is freelancer.com - initially I thought I was scammed by some other user, but if things are as freelancer.com claims they are, then said employer was also charged with a commission and the only one benefiting is freelancer.com.
Another issue, as soon as I submitted a PayPal dispute hoping to block them from taking my money, freelancer.com froze my account saying that now, suddenly, they need to confirm my identity. How will they do that - by me canceling a dispute with Paypal. WARNING: DO NOT CANCEL THE PAYPAL DISPUTE, EVER!! As freelance.com knows really well, once you cancel a dispute, you acknowledge that the other party is right and you CANNOT AGAIN raise any dispute about the same transaction (PayPal rules). Just another example of how freelancer.com tries to trick the users into renouncing their rights. (Also, please note that once your money has been taken - it happens automatically if you were foolish enough to 'verify your payment method' with freelancer.com as it essentially gives them full access to your paypal account and any connected credit cards - PayPal will not be able to help you as their money back guarantee does not cover virtual goods and services. I submitted my claims but freelancer.com completely ignored them, not even once did they respond to Paypal or to me regarding the case, knowing that they are safe and sound and that they have no intention of giving back my money.)

In conclusion, AVOID freelancer.com like a plague. Even if you had positive experiences till now, the very fact they treat users like scum and ignore all complaints should be warning enough.",1,“Extremely bad experience with this site”

986,"Horrible Experience as a Freelancer- Unprofessional Employers and Freelancer STOLE FROM ME- No star at all!

I was happy to find a new opportunity for work on this site and thought all employers are serious and have their own companies. In the first month I have worked for a scam freelancer who was very difficult. I was making articles non-stop and he was asking me  every half an hour if I am making progress. After 2 weeks I saw he was receiving great reviews and feedback for my work and was getting 10-20 more times money than I was for my work. So he was only using freelancers to take money. 

After 4 tough and sleepless months I have finally made $300 to wake up on Valentine's Day with half of the amount gone and the other pending to a skrill account. I don't know how he did that because I couldn't withdraw any sum and normally it should be pending for 1-2 days. I contacted Freelancer and they haven't responded me for 4 days (!) but closed my account and sent me a message saying it's for security reasons. After that they have blocked my account and asked me different pictures to demonstrate it is my account!! (As it I was complaining of theft if it wasn't!). After more than 50 messages, they didn't respond me what they have done with that email who withdraw my money, they didn't answered at any of my questions and only used a formal message to repeat the verifying process. 
Now my account was released, but surprise, I can bid on different jobs but can't receive or send any messages and I already lost 2 jobs because I was informed on my mail that employers messaged me but I couldn't respond.

Since the site passed into the Australian hands, the freelancer.com strongly degraded. A lot of things changed:  the number of projects increased, new functions were added, greed of the freelancer.com grew many times, scam scale increased. The administration isn't capable to control monetary operations. They have no tools for this purpose. It is ok for the site, if after a good review and released payment, freelancer.com reversalt he transaction depriving you earned money. You do not even notified about it. They quietly remove the money from your account. I will say more. Freelancer.com can reversal the transaction after the money is withdrawed and keep your balance in a deep minus , and then they demand from you to put the money back on your frelancer account. As a result the freelancer.com will remove from you 110% (10% fees, which were removed at the beginning of a project + 100% of your earned money that were returned to the employer). Sounds absurd? Today it is quite so on the site. To all claims they answer in the manner We can do nothing. A chargeback has been filed on the employers payment provider. We only take fees.

To give the appearance of reliability? After a project is done, you wont see the money anyway. In addition, you pay 10% fees. Cool! Today the freelancer.com is not the guarantor of honest execution of deal. It is just a message board with the job offers, where you take all risks upon yourself. Freelancer.com only can guarantee that you will pay them all fees for the opportunity to be deceived! It is a pity to lose rating and reviews, but it is even more a pity for the nerves.

Their reasoning: 
Your funds are temporarily put on-hold while we are verifying details of your employer as they are currently facing some account issues with the site. We do understand that the funds were already released to your account as a payment for the project. However, we have a specific department within our organization that validates user accounts and the transactions made to and from. The funds will only be available for withdrawal once their account issue has been settled. Further details regarding the account issues of your employer can no longer be disclosed as only the proper department conducting the verification process has access to that information. We recommend to contact and advise them to visit the Verification Center for them to settle their account issues. If you are unable to contact your employer, we can also send an email to them upon your request. 

My frustration: 
Why am I held responsible for my employer's account issues? Am I considered to be guilty for working with them? It's not my business what on earth is wrong with their account. A fat lot I care about it! It's their account! Not mine! I'm not asking why they are currently facing an account issue and I'm not interesting in any further details regarding their account. My honestly-earned funds are put on-hold. That is my only concern! Why are you holding me hostage in this situation? Why do I have to suffer from my employer's own problems? How do their own problems relate to me? They paid me for my programming services. They were happy with the result and gave me a 5-star rating. So, the money is mine now. Not theirs!

17:25 Muhammad Mushtaq: so my concern is 
17:26 Muhammad Mushtaq: i have got 800$ milestone from another client to refund the disputed ammount 
17:26 Muhammad Mushtaq: now why dispute is open up till now 
17:26 Muhammad Mushtaq: even 800$ is already been deducted from my negative balance 
17:29 Linda G.: Did you returned the Milestone Payment?
17:30 Muhammad Mushtaq: where my 800$ has been gone ?
17:30 Muhammad Mushtaq: which i got from other client 
17:30 Muhammad Mushtaq: 12758353
17:30 Muhammad Mushtaq: gt frm this project 
17:32 Linda G.: You reach out to your employer to settle the dispute. 
17:33 Muhammad Mushtaq: you are not getting me 
17:33 Muhammad Mushtaq: my questions is i have refund him the 85% of 588$ which he paid me 
17:33 Muhammad Mushtaq: in the result of it i have got 800$ from other project so i could refund the disputed ammount 
17:33 Muhammad Mushtaq: but 800$ is gone 
17:34 Muhammad Mushtaq: and dispute is still open 
17:34 Muhammad Mushtaq: i am simply sayng this 
17:36 Linda G.: Your balance is set in to -1087.75 after we locked the payments from stevealaska and andrebfe. 
17:36 Muhammad Mushtaq: yes 
17:36 Muhammad Mushtaq: now question
17:36 Linda G.: When you received the funds from DanEdwardsjr it used it to settle the negative balance. 
17:36 Muhammad Mushtaq: dispuet team givn me 14 days as i requested client to give me 14 days to clear my balance 
17:37 Muhammad Mushtaq: now technically my 800$ must be adjusted to disputed ammount 
17:37 Muhammad Mushtaq: and stevealaska milestone is not mine problem t refund money 
17:37 Muhammad Mushtaq: its on freelancer.com end to setlle the issue with him 
17:38 Muhammad Mushtaq: the project has been paid and closed 3-4 months ago 
17:38 Muhammad Mushtaq: and clients is keep saying i dont need refund its freelancer ding this 
17:38 Muhammad Mushtaq: anywhat ever is the reason it not on my end to clear the stevealaska balance 
17:39 Muhammad Mushtaq: i am bound to clear the balance of disputed ammount which i agreed 
17:39 Muhammad Mushtaq: so technically disputed balance must be cleared first 
17:39 Muhammad Mushtaq: as dispute team,client and me agree to pay ammount n 14 days 
17:39 Muhammad Mushtaq: now i dont have funds anymore 
17:40 Muhammad Mushtaq: i am working and earning

17:40 Muhammad Mushtaq: in this time frame 
17:40 Muhammad Mushtaq: i simply wana adjust this earned money with disputed money 
17:40 Muhammad Mushtaq: simple 
17:40 Muhammad Mushtaq: we will see the rest of negative balance later 
17:40 Linda G.: Your employer stevealaska has to account related issues that is the reason why their released funds was locked. 
17:41 Muhammad Mushtaq: yes but 
17:41 Muhammad Mushtaq: its nt my fault at all you can see the chat logs with the employer here on freelancer 
17:41 Muhammad Mushtaq: what he said about the issue 
17:41 Muhammad Mushtaq: so i worked i get paid 
17:41 Muhammad Mushtaq: whatever the issue is 
17:41 Muhammad Mushtaq: its on freelancer.com and clients issue 
17:42 Muhammad Mushtaq: i worked and client paid me 
17:42 Muhammad Mushtaq: simple
17:42 Muhammad Mushtaq: if something arises in payment veriffication it could be the responsiblity of platform to take care of it 
17:42 Muhammad Mushtaq: as we are payig high fees on this platform as compare to any of platform on internet 
17:43 Muhammad Mushtaq: i hope you understand what i am saying 
17:43 Muhammad Mushtaq: i wana adjust my earned money of 800$ with disputed ammount first 
17:46 Linda G.: You can write this to the dispute page. 
17:46 Muhammad Mushtaq: what i can write 
17:46 Linda G.: To close the dispute, you must reached an agreement with your employer. 
17:46 Muhammad Mushtaq: can you tell me clearly 
17:47 Muhammad Mushtaq: i already agreed to client to refund the money 
17:47 Muhammad Mushtaq: so i dont have problem in it 
17:47 Linda G.: Our arbitration team can make the adjustment if you want to returned the payment to your employer andrebfe.
17:47 Muhammad Mushtaq: as i am repeating same thing again and again to you that i wana adjust my earned money 
17:48 Muhammad Mushtaq: can you forward to them the same i said 
17:49 Linda G.: You can write your concern to the dispute page so our dispute team can read it. 
17:49 Muhammad Mushtaq: so you cant adjust it right ?
17:50 Muhammad Mushtaq: and what abut the stevealaska dispute 
17:50 Muhammad Mushtaq: what is that ?
17:50 Linda G.: No, I cannot adjust it. 
17:51 Linda G.: stevealaska has to settle their account related issues before your funds can be reinstated. 
17:51 Muhammad Mushtaq: he said 
17:51 Muhammad Mushtaq: freelancer is not responding properly 
17:51 Muhammad Mushtaq: they are delyaing so much

A suggestion.....legal action is no where near as satisfying as moving your business elsewhere.  The useful idea is having a website to connect emloyers and employees. I see no reason to hold money (if you need escrow there are already escrow websites if you prefer direct action you may pay by paypal or bitcoin) or to charge any fees beyond maybe 1 USD per month to maintain a forum style site. The site would be populated by our existing contacts.

Yes because *ALL* payments made from an employer can be reversed on *ANY* time!!!!!!!! And yes, their FAQ told exactly opposite.

The reversal was caused by your employer's account issue. Since we already sent an email to your employer, and you have a copy of it, you may contact your employer directly outside our site to settle this matter.""

They are suspended my account unnecessary. They can block my account money but they total suspended my account.They break their own rule.

Most of the case all willbelevie my long experience with freelancer,they are basically work to help buyer they never help a freelancer.If you go any dispute 99% time you will not win

Now work on freelancer is very very difficult previously it was not like that.

Can you imagine a freelancer who are their clients last 9 years  easily block his account .That means we have no rights.Now client is happy get everything I get nothing plus my account block.Do you want that,work here.This is critical thing but they take it like a normal things.Compare other freelancer site much much better features than freelancer.

My experienced involved getting my account suspended, money being taken from my pay pal account on more than one occasion, a huge delay in getting that money returned and getting the suspension on the account lifted. When free lancer finally decided it would pay me it delayed the release of funds for 2 weeks because it was a first time payment. Now my dealings with them is done I have been trying for two weeks to get my account closed via their support page, amazingly as soon as I ask'd first time, my access to the support page suddenly stopped working and the live chat always displays as away.

the problem is that he doesnt come online after that job he just come for that job so i asked if the employer didnt reply then support team tells then i will not get money until verification system is complete.

this is total scam i have proof of complete project and chat history with freelnacer support when it comes to higher amount more than 800 usd they are playing scam. without any complaint from the employer they are not letting to withdraw my funds. and instead says you can spend it in freelancer.com itself i have no disputes no complaints by the employer also so why this.

1023,"I was a 2 year member with 81 positive 5 star perfect reviews, I was tested within the top 1% for several of their skills like wordpress and Joomla.   I made several thousand through them.   I suddenly have one problem with an upset customer who lost a dispute against me in arbitration, who then lies to their customer service and tells them I hacked his website.   They instantly suspend my account and freeze my funds.   If you're one of those people like I was, reading these bad reviews thinking ""I have good feedback it won't happen to me""  think again, The MARCUS guy responding to these threads is the incompetent person that suspended me.   They don't care about your solid history with them, they'll believe heresy with no proof from a person who's brand new to their website.   They don't care about you.  Don't believe what MARCUS tells you on these threads, and don't believe the next person they'll have auto responding to these after the fake MARCUS account gets a bad reputation.   A few months ago it was Elenor, now it's Marcus, it's the same person.

Do not use freelancer for any business, they have the worst customer service of  any website on the internet.   They are nothing short of incompetent, they are outsourced, their customer support is not Australian based and they could care less about the company, its reputation, or you.   You can try as hard as you want, you'll never get through to someone who has any sense.   You'll get better results pounding sand.

Don't bother responding Marcus, my attorney has already contacted you.",1,“I was a 2 year member with 81 positive 5 star perfect...” 
1024,"Please all people complain against them on this link they will verify issue: http://www.accc.gov.au/
 (Freelancer.com don't right to hold payment of person who are not indulge in guilty). And I have taken this matter to Australian fair trade (ACCC Home).

Did Australian government granted them any legal power??
It is under Australian Govt Jurisdiction. Also asked them why they think they have judicial powers. 

If you are an employer or contractor make sure you are not falling in this trap. Fight for your right. 

My username was silverhope' in freelancer.com ( Freelancer staff is illiterate, group of foolish and uneducated people) unable to verify simple documents. The are looting people by holding their payments more than 4 months. They cover their loss from service providers.   It is requested to write letter to Australian Government and tell them they are giving mental torture. Legally they have not right to hold anyone payment. Australian Govt require more applications to take action against them as per discussion.

Freelacer.com staff and CEO is scammer. I planned to take legal action against CEO of freelancer.com who is cheater and dishonest person. He is very clever person. In other words he is trying to hold hard earned amount of service providers by different ways. 
I was user in freelancer.com since 2 years. I left my job because earning from freelancer.com was good. Now I am jobless. Reason is this I got $1000 in freelancer.com account from different clients. Freelancer.com CEO wants to fund for his personal benefit so he suspended different people account by making different reasons in which my account is also included. 
They hold my payments and refused to refund it. On the other hand they use different ways to get payment from service provider. Sometime freelancer.com staff reversed payment from your freelancer.com and make lame excuses that your client has reversed from his Paypal. Mean that service provider value in freelancer.com is like a dog. 
Suppose being a service provider you provide services to the client who are located in another country and you found him via freelancer.com platform. If freelancer has issue with this client regarding bank issue of client and client cleared your pay. If client get work from service provider and pay the service provider then freelancer.com will not allow withdrawing payment to service provider and send them message to ask your client so solve his bank account issue. How service provider responsible for the bank account of client. He paid us for our services and freelancer should take his responsibility himself. Service provider is not the servant of freelancer.com to verify the client account. If client don't contact then your hard earning will be in the account of freelancer.com. Government should take serious action against this website. My lawyer is making detail documents for them.
Their staff is uneducated and cannot verify simple documents. If you want to save your time then create account in Odesk.com,vworkers.com and guru.com
Freelancer.com has illiterate staff. Stupid people don't verify simple document . Staff will treat you like a dog.
Soon I will take legal action against CEO.",1,“Please all people complain against them on this link...”

Well Marcus it seems that the replies we send to you do not show up under your reply so we will put this one above yours
I am a member I have not gotten a job from the site. I am going on 25 years as a drafter. I do mechanical drafting and design. I work in AutoCad and SoildWorks I use the two together to get some great 3d model's. 
I get a lot of e-mails that wants 3d animator this is not listed in my job skills ( I get these E-Mails all hours of the night) I have bid on several jobs. A  lot of the job's  I do and put a png of the job on my profile (less some Info) to try to get the job. I pay to get my name at the top of the list ""you know sponsored"" just to be e-mailed that the job was taken down or removed changed or in someway caused me to lose the money put up to put me at the top.
Marcus  note that you answered and no-one that have made money did. 
You see if they answer now I would just think like the rest of the Jabber group here that you just put  it in.

We have been using freelancer.com site for last 5 years   (when they were calling it a getafreelancer.com). We are small company employing almost 100 people and catering to different groups of clients through our outsourcing services. As we have more candidates and therefore we are having five different marketing peoples using the site with different accounts. 

The strange stuff starts from here;

#1 Recently, we noticed the most of the projects are being either canceled by Buyers or expired because of non activity. We have been awarded with some projects and as usual after accepting them, freelancer.com deducted fees (no issue with that). 

#2 Second, those project's Buyers have requested us to stop working on projects because of change in mindset. They do not want to continue developing the project. So we mutually agreed to stop working and they deposited partial payment as we requested.

#3 Now, what freelancer did. They have deducted payments as Reversal milestone and make negative balance in one of our account. Next, to remove negative balance, they converted other currency payment. Done all within an hour and we lost our hard earned payment.

Now we have been trying to contact freelancer.com customer representative, but still did not get any response after 48 hours. Though, as a matter of fact, we posted general ticket and we got response within an hour. Should not we assume there is something wrong doing going on behind curtains?

SPECIAL NOTE TO EVERYONE: IF YOU HAVE PAYMENT IN FREELANCER.COM ACCOUNT, WITHDRAW IT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE YOU GOT PAYMENT DEDUCT WITHOUT ANY JUSTIFIABLE REASON.

""This was a freelancer mistake that I have raised 3 weeks ago. I was trying to pay with my usual paypal and but they have charged my credit card which was never deposited into my account on freelancer.
Don't know why they contacted you, it was their mistake.""   When informed freelancer about it they said they as per terms, I am not supposed to get my money back until buyer refunds and they did not even pay me back their fees that they have taken. They say they wont contest the chargeback even. So, apparently, you dont have any security on freelancer They would pay you for your hardwork and then they would take money back for their own issues and they would not even return the fees. So, at the end, you pay for your client's work plus freelancer fees and waste a lot of your time as well.

I know that as a person looking to get hired for a small job such as making music for someone or doing graphic design, you get naturally excited and want to jump right in on the 'too good to be true' deal. When I first entered the site, it was confusing to find things, and I think by trying to make the website more organized with every update possible, the web designers made it more confusing and didn't keep it simple. I am not quite sure if I feel safe with having my things on this site. A word of caution: Just don't waist your time and account information... To me, they talk the talk and do not walk the walk.

1052,"Freelancer.com - this site used to be a marketplace for people to find work and others who want to get their work done. Just after this site got merged with scriptlance.com and vworker.com (Rent a coder - old name), the pool of freelancers increased to millions. Most of them from Indian and from Pakistan, Bangladesh. Now the situation with freelancer is that they are not interested in looking at the way projects are being posted or whether there is any minimum bid policy. People on freelancer can ask for anything that can take weeks and just post $30 to get this done. Obviously, many will jump into this to get done, but the problem comes for employers after they start work with such people. They either don't get satisfied work or get reasons from freelancer that scope is increasing. The problem is somewhere in middle, it is freelancer's bad policy if exposing others bids, others profile that make the situation so vulnerable. Is there anyone who wants to pay more for getting something done, when there is some one else who is so confident to say he can get it done.

Freelancer is just getting more and more worse day by day and they are just looking to be interested in making their UI more beautiful and fancy. Come on freelancer, focus on value which has created your base of business. Focus on your freelancer and employers who work together. See how many of them are happy. Else sooner your days are countable in fingers. People will just stop using you. 

Also please stop marketing gifts, coupons etc. People come to your website for work, provide them good work place and they will be happy. Learn from elance and odesk. They know how to do business better. You have scored high only by acquiring your next competitors and showing your self big.

The quality is typically inferior, as most jobs are required in 'real' English, something that cannot be delivered by most from the sub-continent and far east members on the site, who are awarded the jobs because they are cheap to hire. As a Native UK speaker and writer, I cannot find anything on the site that becomes worth my time as I am not prepared to work for such ridiculously low amounts.

2. Because the bids are low, the projects are rewarded at the lowest cost - then the employer wonders why the quality is no good! You get what you pay for and if you want to cut costs - write articles yourself or pay proper money, to 'real' native English writers (From UK, US, Canada, Australia), who can actually string a sentence together correctly.

Of course, Freelancer do not care about the quality, and will wash their hands of this aspect of the project - all they want is money. A bit like eBay, they don't really care about their sellers, just their $$$'s",1,“Just about everything that could be wrong about freelance...”

1060,"www.freelancer.com gets most traffic of freelancers, old and new, in view of its convenient and easy to remember domain name. In my opinion, that's the first trap laid out.

I am seriously considering sticking to www.odesk.com and www.elance.com as they are more publicized, professional and have far more good reviews. I will close my www.freelancer.com account for good due to a couple of reasons.

First, freelancers on www.freelancer.com have to bid and compete for projects. Freelancers from third world nations, like India and Pakistan, have ruined the market. 

They are more dominant in bidding as they can go really cheap to a level that is ""ridiculously"" low. They are able to stoop so low due to favorable exchange rates.

They surely need to establish ""minimum bid"" policy on projects and quality control on freelancers.

Second, www.freelancer.com takes such a long time to process my payment and at the end of it, it keeps disputing several payments on work done with all sorts of excuses. 

As a result, this held back the whole sum that I have requested ""cash out"". 

I have been doing freelancing as a full time job via www.freelancer.com for almost three years now. As my numbers add up, it keeps disputing and delaying payment of amounts due to me. It's habitual. Recently, they froze my account at their whims and fancy.

Their Customer Service is absolutely the worst and my first go around with them, I thought perhaps I was going insane. As far as money and time invested into this site versus a return? I have lost thousands of dollars (I can easily prove this by averaging the amount of money that I made via other routes as a freelancer and not through freelancer.com). Between the gamification that never works correctly to the nearly 90% of jobs I bid on actually expiring because the creators of the jobs just left them hanging (and I have bid on well close to 50-60 jobs and submitted proposals with said bids) to the fact that their marketing is geared toward constantly making you spend money to ""highlight your bid"" or ""take yet another test to move ahead""... it's absolutely sad and I regret every cent and bit of time that I spent with freelancer.com. If 90% of the bids I had just simply expired yet I spent all this time highlighting and taking tests to win them and answering questions of the job owner before they left running.. this means I was coaxed to spend more and more money by the website with repeatedly getting no return.. while making money and thriving as a freelancer through other means and websites so I know its not my ability or presentation... and if I google freelancer.com, nothing but terrible reviews come up for them.... well..

I am also convinced that the supposed 9 million users are mostly fake or scam accounts. And the legitimate employers are the ones that want to pay you 20 bucks for 100 hours of hard work!! I also just read in a freelance poll that 46% of freelancers never receive the full amount agreed upon which shows the great need for better protection for freelancers. Obviously, reading these reviews here, shows this as fact.

In reading all these reviews about people getting ripped off, I am now glad I did not get awarded any jobs because chances are that I would have been ripped off anyway.

They let scam artists get away with the worst acts.  I was lured to Freelancer.com by a guy I found on odesk.  It turned out (and I found out later on) that odesk banned him several times over, and that's why he brings clients over to Freelancer.   At first I felt comforted by the fact that Freelancer had this ""DISPUTE"" section complete with the ability to present evidence and an arbitration process, it seemed like I could have that assurance that if this guy pulled something shady, I could always turn to it.  This freelancer turned out to be bad news.  I wanted to dispute the last few payments for fraud on his part.  I had a SIGNED agreement with that freelancer, in which he even signed his own name, address AND his FREELANCER.COM NAME!!!  Not only did I think that Freelancer.com would be accommodating, given their dispute section, but I would have thought that freelancer.com would have been happy to get a scammer off their site.

Freelancer.com responded to me saying that they weren't going to do anything because the work was not processed within their ""milestones framework"" Can you believe this. I paid over $10,000, and all I kept getting from Freelancer was a mechanical response, with a ""tip"" for the future of using the milestones.  Yeah thanks...

1088,"I have been using freelancer for MANY years and have over 100 5 star reviews as a freelancer and 38 5 star reviews as an employer. Everything was great until last week and this week, they handled a situation VERY BADLY, in fact its still ongoing and no resolution has been placed yet. 

Let me recount the events for you guys:

I went on vacation to mexico in early october, I came back and realized that my location had changed to bangaladesh, I thought that was weird, but in my mind I just thought that freelancer did that because they wanted me to re-verify my address which was still kind of weird logic but I didn't think too much of it at first. 

Next, I logged into my email and found emails saying I tried to add a new payment method and I was trying to withdraw to that payment method. I thought that was very weird.

Third, because of the strange activity I changed my password and notified freelancer  that I believe my account was hacked and they should resore everything how it was previous to the hack occourance, which by the way was the same exact settings I have had on my account for many YEARS! 

Freelancer replied to that by shutting down my account completely, asking me questions, taking 24 or more hours to reply each time, going back and forth with more questions. Then once the questions were over they asked me to send them proof of my residence, my photo id with a code attached, they approved my documents and gave me my account back. I thought to my self, finally this terrible ordeal they put me through is over, IT WAS NOT OVER! Now I was not able to withdraw funds from my account or cancel milestones either! I had a customer who was under dispute with me I had agreed to cancel their milestone and I could not do it, I also had funds that I could not take. This is terrible and stopped me from doing any more business on freelancer. 

Now Freelancer keeps asking me for the same documents which I already provided the first time to get my account back, they ask the same things over and over to the point where they will soon put me out of business. 

I live with my mother, her name is on the utility bills, I sent copies of my bank statement, my photo ID, my face to match and their silly little key code which is completely un neccesary but I sent that too and still they are not happy even after I already sent it to them when they first froze my account and they already approved it.....

I don't know what to say, maybe freelancer just no longer wants me :(",1,“I have been using freelancer for MANY years and have...” 
1089,"Up until a few days ago I had read the reviews on sites like this and knew how bad people claimed freelancer.com claimed to be. It didn't bother me, because I was making good money at the time. Last month I cleared almost $1800 from the site as a relatively new freelancer that joined just a few months prior.
Everything was good until the problems started. First of all  the milestone system is terrible. It is a false sense of security. I found this out when I was paid $150 for a project and then two days later logged into my account to see it reversed. I of course immediately contacted freelancer support via their chat option and this was a complete waste of time  as they are absolutely no help. The support is indeed VERY terrible. If you don't believe me, contact them right now and try to get anything resolved with your account. Like others have said  freelancer supports delivers the same copy and passed messages over and over again and has no power to actually resolve anything. They will simply tell you they will forward your ticket to another department  this department may or may not respond  and they cannot resolve anything either. 

Freelancer.com support told me the employer who had paid me had issues with their credit card and so they had to reverse the payment and that there was nothing they could do. ""Okay"", I thought, at least I hadn't withdrawn the money, so I didn't actually LOSE anything but hours of work. I'll live.
Unfortunately, the shenanigans of freelancer.com's inadequate policies didn't stop there. 

The other day I logged in and noticed my account was $-200, I had $50 in my account prior to logging in and naturally I was confused by this. I checked my transactions and it turns out freelancer.com had reversed ANOTHER milestone for a project I had completed THREE WEEKS PRIOR! I couldn't believe it! I of course contacted freelancer.com support who told me I should contact the employer to get their account fixed (of course I haven't spoken to the employer or seen them online in over 3 weeks, so good luck).

The, milestones, chargebacks, and poor support aren't the only problem on the site; the dispute system is terrible as well. I've only been involved in two disputes and I have over 20 five star reviews on my profile. Well, my two disputes were over the exact same problem; the employer refusing to pay for the work I had completed. The first time it happened it was only over $30 USD and we both pleaded our case and I didn't even upload screenshots it took 3 weeks  but the arbitration team finally ruled in my favor. I should also note the employer was almost as new as I was, but he had several 5 star feedbacks as well

Fast forward to a month later and I run into this problem with a brand new employer. Every freelancer knows sometimes you run into an employer that you cannot please no matter what you do. The employer cancelled the project while I was trying to remedy the project and filed a dispute. This time it was over $300 with the EXACT same set of circumstances. This time, I even uploaded screenshots of the employer agreeing to at least make a partial payment for the work I had already completed. 

3 weeks go by and I finally get an email saying I've LOST the dispute. This employer was also brand new and had 0 reviews; in fact, I was their very first project. So in short: your odds of winning a dispute are the same as flipping a coin in the air. Doing the math: $150 for the first reversed milestone, $250 for the second, $15 for losing the dispute $200 for the settlement amount I agreed to (out of $300) and lost. That's $615 Freelancer has successfully SCAMMED me out of. If you're working for this site and you haven't been scammed yet  you've been lucky  but as I said your luck will run out sooner or later. 

If you are going to use the site never let your balance get too high. Thank god I had over $400 in my account at one time and was able to withdrawal it just before the crap hit the fan, but now I am out of work and have alternative source of income.",1,“Up until a few days ago I had read the reviews on sites...”

I got my first project awarded today by some fake employer with no ratings. I don't know how he was allowed to award me the project because as per Freelancer policy, an unrated employer needs to deposit 20% of the project value before awarding it. They didn't collected this amount from him as they new he was fake but went ahead and charged my legitimate Paypal account with $12.59 CAD as their commission of the Project value which I didn't receive a single cent yet and will not receive as the employer is fake.
I immediately stopped further direct debit from my Paypal account to prevent Freelancer to extract more money from me. I don't understand whether their motto is to generate income for us or to rip us off.
Anyways, when I complained they say their project fee is non-refundable and whether the employer pays or not it is your problem not their. They got my money so they are enjoying. I have raised a dispute on the transaction with Paypal on the grounds that Freelancer should have collected 20% project value from the unrated employer. Lets see what happens.

We had a project running there (iOS app), which looked fine at the beginning as the developer sent a video as proof of his work, we paid the first milestone.

Since we never received the finished project we didn't pay the rest of the money (sounds logical).

We wanted to use the money already in our account to pay a second developer we hired, which freelancer didn't do, because they needed additional account information. After completing the informatinos they wanted nothing happened, excpet that they were threatening us to close our account.

Sending emails and support tickets did not change anything, they wanted us to grant them permission to pay the first job (which still is unfinished). We lost approx. US$ 800.- there, our account doesn't exist anymore.

They closed the case we opened, we had to remind them many time that the dispute is not solved.

A few investigations showed that several people use freelance.com to systematically rip off people that offer them work. 
The way that freelancer.com functions perfectly protects fraudsters of any kind, once you got money in an account there you will never ever get it back.

What they do and how they do it is illegal in our country.

The purpose of a site like freelance is to protect people who make business using their site, but as it looks they only care about the money that flows through their site, and giving their best to restrict withdrawals.

In generally we don't work anymore with freelancer sites, we hire freelancers directly after having talked to them on skype and after having them finished a little project (something stupidly simple like a ""hello world"" without any value or use). Every serious developer is more than willing to invest 30 mins in order to get a job that pays well.

Stay far away from freelance.com, roasting marshmellows over burning dollar bills is much less frustrating.",1,"“Sad to hear that they not only still exist, but haven't...” "

Sounds like very-well designed system to treat you like a modern computer slave.

I won't be using them again (I made sure I withdrew all my money from my account before posting this as I just don't trust them).",1,“I had a client who just vanished owing a fair amount...” 
1098,"Hi

I am using freelancer.com since years now, it was a good site at first, really fast, php-based. I won't complain on money issues here because, to be honest, I never had an issue with them about this, other than usual withdrawal delays and high fees. Not to mention I don't tend to hold a lot of money on there, not even on paypal; I usually withdraw to my atm card as soon as I can. I don't trust none online service to hold my money. 

Now, freelancer.com made changes during the years, most of them terrible, i.e. website speed, limitation on bids for free users and others. Always to damage the worker and focus on their own pocket selling you memberships. The site used to fly back in 2006 when it was purely php based, no Ajax, no crap whatsoever. Now, it's full of that, you get Ajax up your ass even from going to page 1 to 2 through projects before bidding. Ajax sites are slow, didn't you know it GAF? Java is slow, Javascript is slow, didn't you know it? I remember clicking on my user profile and having to switch to a faster laptop I have at home because the page simply didn't load on a decent P3, 1ghz RAM. Isn't it a P3 1ghz RAM enough to display a black and white, non-flash page properly and fast? They seem to have fixed that, though

Now, this is the problem we have now and this one is *serious*. Since 10 days ago freelancer changed something that's ruinning our businness and they care $#*! fixing it. I am talking about the private messaging system which is *now disabled* when you bid. This means you can't send samples to your employeer, nor private messages anymore. Unless customer starts a private message. 

And this is not even the worst! Line break is not respected in your bid text!! So, now that you are not allowed to send private messages (unless customer starts a private message with you), you have to place links in your bid text in order to actually have a *chance* to get the job! Read below the conversation we had with customer support:

---
> Freelancer >staff: ""Keep in mind that our site does not support line breaks on the bid page. ""

Me: And do you think this is something to be proud of ? Is it like a ""feature"" ?

So are you telling your whole 9 million users that not having the ability to 
properly space paragraphs out, making the whole text a whole unreadable mess is 
a feature or something to be proud of!?!

Imagine you have to write in your bid something bulleted such as:

Paragraph 1

Details:

- line 1
- line 2
- line 3
- line 4

Paragraph 2

- link 1
- link 2

Your buyer will read it like: Paragraph 1Details:- line 1 - line 2 - line 3 - line 4Paragraph 2- link 1- link 2

*** And are you saying this is a feature and not a bug of freelancer.com that 
should be addressed? ***
----

This is totally unbelievable, all they have to do is replacing the line break by a <br> upon displaying the bid text and they are not doing it. It's a whole line of code what they have to add. This is getting us *no job* since days, damaging our busines while in the past we had a strong customer messaging based on the samples we showed

My experience as a business man tells that you can convince a customer better with a good sample rather than with a small paragraph of text telling him that you are an expert in the field. Both thigns are killer, but if one of them is missing you don't make it

If their approach was avoiding spam and/or copy/paste messages with this measure, this is not the way to handle it
I strongly suggest everybody post a ticket into their support system in order to let them know as a community that we need the private messaging system back OR AT LEAST the line break respected in bid's text

I am trying to get someone at freelancer.com support to actually do something about one of thier members, who threatened and bullied me, hacked into my site, using the hack code HE had left in it, while do a project that he never completed. He then blackmailed me into payment and leaving a 5 star review or he would delte my whole website. He much glee in this fact.

I have even email him this morning to ask again for my money back, then told him I have notified them of the abuse, he has literally told me, that he isn't worried as Freelancer.com won't actually do anything. So clearly this has happened before.

To clarify he hacked into MY website and blackmailed me into payment and the review and they seem to be supporting this guy, I presume because they get more money from him than me, absolutely shocking.

I uploaded my drivers license numerous times and other forms of governement id. But they kept saying they dont accept it for one reason or another and making up excuses. 
So eventually they stole over $250 from my bank and I had to file a fraud alert with my bank to get the money back. And my programmers on Freelancer didnt get paid either. The only ones who got paid were the crooks at freelancer

1104,"Freelancer is the worst website to start your freelancing career.

I say this because I got burned several times but everytime that happens, I went back hoping it would get better but it never did. My experience just got worser every time.

1. In the beginning, I accepted several projects, so I got deducted $5 each time. Even if you project is just for $30 or less, you still get $5 deduction. Even if the client does not communicate to you anymore, they still won't refund the fee to you

2. The first time you withdraw money from them, you will need to wait THREE WEEKS. This is an absolutely ridiculous rule. 

3. I entered a 'guaranteed' contest worth $750 usd. Their guideline says that if the contest holder does not award a winner, the contest prize will be split among the contestants. Because the prize at stake was big, and because I knew I have a likely chance of winning, I decided to join the contest. It took me a week to prepare my entry since I had to research about the company, read their requirements, write a script, find a voice talent, hire a professional recording studio to do the job, find someone who knows how to edit an audio file and add sound clips to make a decent radio ad jingle, and finally, summon all my courage to submit. I was able to convince the voice talent as well as the audio editor that we would split equally if we win, but I already paid for the recording studio's fees. After more than a month, they credited my account $75 since the contest holder did not award any winner. BUT at the same time, they deducted 10% from the amount, which is $7.50 as prize fee. This was okay until Freelancer decided to reverse the payment and deduct me $75 without any notice! Yup, that's right, they can spam your email with daily notifications of projects but they never give you a notice for something as important as your money! I've since withdrawn the money to paypal and only left a few dollars so now it turns out I owe them $60! That's just absurd. Please note that I never even fully received $75 because they also deducted the prize fee of $7.50, but when they decide to reverse, they deduct me the full $75! So this basically means that I paid $7.50 as prize fee for a contest that I didn't even win in the first place!

4. They allow employers to post projects that have budgets which are way too low. Logo designs at $10 (of course, the freelancers actually only get $5, because the other $5 is for their non-refundable fee), and writing jobs at $0.5 per 500 words! I mean, how's that even fair?

I finally decided on one and contacted them ( seoleader1). According to their feedback, everyone raves about how they got good work done and how easy it was to work with this freelancer. He accepted the project right away after agreeing on the terms. He then told me that I need to release a milestone (pay him) before he even starts the job because everybody else that he as worked for had always done it. I was hesitant but finally said fine and went ahead and did it. Little did I know that as soon as you release a milestone, the project is marked as completed. I was concerned but he reassured me that I can trust him to get the work done and his feedback is proof. He then asked me to leave him feedback, that after a project is completed, I only have 5 days to leave feedback, that if we left good feedback for each other, we both would benefit with good reviews on our accounts. That is when i really started getting concerned and said absolutely no way I would leave feedback. I asked when he would be done and he said it would take 3wks. Just before 3wks was up, I contacted the guy to ask how my project was going and he told me that everything was ok and on schedule. A few days after the three week deadline, I contacted him again, he didn't respond for a couple days until after I threatened to contact freelancer. To cut it short. I contacted freelancer to try and get a resolution and all they told me was that its my fault that I released the milestone and there was nothing they could do.

I have used an insanity of time in finding a skilled coder for a simple job in html and css - but bidders turn out to be middlemen, contractors, false bidders, or/and not what they claim to be. 

Trying to find a freelancer and inviting to the project, after three attempts, where they all decline from the project, its clear something is going on - bit by bit Freelancer empties my account in fees - lately I found that I had a premium membership of 24.95 USD, even I havnt signed up for any membership - so I expect they will draw this amount any day now.

My account balance transfered from vworker, I dont expect to get my money back. I dont expect to get any work done.

It's an idiotic notion to charge money for something you're not going to use anymore. But the freelancer.com people didn't strike me as idiots but as thiefs, applying charges and telling you only after the moeny is in their pockets.

1137,"Hello,

I've recently logged into my freelancer.com account after quite some time. To my knowledge I had £60 in my account which was for a previous project I'd posted on there. 

I selected a freelancer for a job, but upon receiving actual reviews on his work rather than the fabricated ones on the site I decided to pull the plug, as the freelancer was dishonest and incapable of completing what was needed, therefore my money was safe and secure in my account and ready to use on another job....or so I thought.

Upon logging in yesterday, I notice my balance is 0.00GBP, upon contacting freelancer regarding the issue I was given this response

""Our records show that your account has been charged of monthly dormant fees. The balance in your account which was £60 GBB was converted to USD to pay for these fees. These charges are made for storage, bandwidth, support and management costs of providing hosting of the user's profile, portfolio storage, listing in directories, provision of the HireMe service, file storage and message storage.""

I was not initially made aware these fees were charged (It's well hidden in the T's & C's), I was not made aware when the fees were taken, nor have I received an invoice or bill of any sorts. 

If I'd have know this was the case I'd have prefered to give the money to the initial consultant than freelancer.com!

I'm now wondering If I'm in debt with freelancer.com as my balance is 0gbp so obviously the dormant fee has surpassed the amount in my account!

In conclusions - STAY AWAY FROM THE SITE! FREELANCER.COM IS THE SCAMMER NOT THE CONSULTANS AND WORKERS ON THE SITE!

Just search google for 'freelancer.com scam'",1,"“Hello,” "
1138,"My problem is not with a contractor on freelancer.com, but with freelancer.com themselves.  I clearly documented a problem with their site which caused me to pay a contractor twice for the same work.  Their customer service completely ignored the issue, blaming me, and accepting no responsibility.  Even though I had clearly documented the issue with screen shots and a bug report.

Payments for projects are handled in ""milestones"".  You create a milestone for a dollar amount, which represents a portion of the project.  When that portion is complete, you release the milestone payment to the contractor.

I had a dispute with my contractor and offered to settle partial payment, for partial work completed.  So used the milestone option for partial payment.  Freelancer.com then reported back to me that the entire milestone amount had been cancelled, with no indication of any partial payment being made, and the milestone was removed.  By contrast, if I had paid the full milestone, it would clearly show as ""payment released"".  Therefore, I would expected that a partial payment would show some indication of ""partial payment released"", possibly including the ammount.  Instead, the milestone was removed completely as ""canceled"".

Wanting to be a good employer and honor my original agreement with the contractor, I created a new milestone of the amount we had agreed on, and released that payment to the contractor.

A few days later, I found the option to see my transaction history, which is buried deep in the website.  There I found that they had released payment for both the partial payment, and the second milestone.  I went back to the project section where there are a few places to view milestone history, and they all showed the second milestone as being the only one paid, with no indication of partial payment on the first milestone.

I realized that this could get confusing very fast, so I took the time to document the bug in the proper format, along with screenshots that show how freelancer.com doesn't provide the correct information.

After a couple help tickets (they have no phone support, and take a full day for any kind of email correspondence), I am now giving up and just won't use the site anymore.  All reps I emailed with told me that ""Freelancer does not release payment, only the employer does this."", completely ignoring the fact that they told me the milestone was cancelled for the full amount, when it had actually been partially paid.

I understand that websites sometimes contain bugs or usability issues, but the fact that they completely ignored the real underlying issue, and refused to take responsibility, is a stance that I can't accept.  I would strongly recommend to other people thinking of using the site to proceed with caution.Your review will help others learn about this website.

1139,"Here is my 2C about Freelancer.com

I have started using this website to outsource work back in 2007 when they were still getafreelancer.com 

Things were ok for me at the time and I was happy with their fee and the way website functioned. I had posted and completed around 300 jobs on their website. As said, at the time I thought fees where fair and I was getting the job done. I even suggested two changes to the platform to them and both were implemented on the site. 

This year I had bit of a break and did not use them for a while. Then I got some more work to do and naturally, I logged into my account to post the job. And got nasty surprise. Their fees have gone up by double and are now the most expensive fees in the freelancing. I have no idea how much of the cut are they taking from freelancers but me as an employeer was charged fee for posting (fair enough but still rates are stupidly expensive), then I was charge for transaction to pay them, charged fee for canceling one of the projects that did not go ahead and it just seemed that all of the sudden they are the greediest bunch in the industry. So I moved on to other platforms that are far better. I am not working for any of the competitors so I won't mention who am I using now but there are far better and choices out there for hiring freelancer. 

Forgot to mention that some of the freelancer I met there and worked with (and still am but on the freelancer.com) have left as well as they told me horror abuse stories about percentage they were receiving from freelancer.com

1170,"Freelancer Took $710 AUD from my bank account. You know what is showing as my balance? its -$40 USD (Minus $40). 
This site is complete Bull$#*!.

let me explain:
When I setup a 1st Milestone:- Their system asked me to make a payment to fund a milestone, from available option i picked Direct Deposit and make a payment to their HSBC account in Australia. 

Later I found out that they also automatically withdraw money from my Paypal account too. so hence i ended up making double payments. 

When i tried to reverse the automatic payment from Paypal, I found that my freelancer account was limited and all i left was with -$40 USD.

Their milestone setup process lead me to make a double payment, if i was told that payment is already taken from paypal then i would have not make a second payment via direct deposit.

So basically they stole my $709.90 AUD. and I still owe them $40 according to their books.

How can they rip us off like this? How can we take action against this?",1,“Freelancer Took $710 AUD from my bank account” 
1171,"COMPLETE RUBBISH....did 3 simple jobs, total of $100 USD, but they scalped 30%, and then pinged me an additional $50 to convert UK and South African Dollars (on 2 jobs) to US dollars to pay,  I ended up with $11.....  Not sure about you,  but I don't freelance for 11%....total BS",1,“COMPLETE RUBBISH....” 
1172,"Stay away from this website, they're scammer. They let their freelancers worked for the clients and then once they have a lot of money in their account, they would blocked the account under pretence of Money Laundering Act.  They would pocket the money for themselves and leave their freelancers high and dry.

They also scammed clients on Freelancer.com.  Whenever you create a project or contest, they automatically preselect some of expensive features that you may or may not want. If you accidently missed one of the preselect features, you will be charged $33 per feature. When you try to contact them to cancel, they said it's not refundable. So they're doing it on purpose to make money off unsuspecting clients.

I'll use ODesk now.",1,"“Stay away from this website, they're scammer” "
1173,"I have written to valerie about my problem, but it's pathetic to see they don't even reply.

Here is the transcription of my message sent to valerie:
Hello Valerie,
               I am a freelancer on your site, and have completed my first project and currently doing second. My first project got me, $48.00, you guys deducted your commission, so i was left with $43.20. Applied for currency conversion from dollar to rupee,

So, $43.20 becomes 2381.62 (55.13 being the exchange rate), infact the USD to Rupee conversion should have 57.60 as on that day, $1=57.60. 
Then, i realized, is have only have one source, through which i can be get my funds, i.e., PAYPAL. So, again applied for currency conversion and now 2381.62 becomes $38.99. Therefore, $43.20 becomes $38.99 inshort.

Then, i tried to withdraw my remaining funds, after paypal charges of $1 i can now withdraw, $37.99 above your minimum limit of $35. But, then you showed me STATUS DELAYED (for funds withdrawal).

So, i had to google, to make out whether you are a SCAM or what? From the reviews site, i got your email ID and you promised to help some of them, so i have come to you directly to help me. my questions are:

1. How can you convert $1=55.13 when the actual currency conversion rate on that day was $1=57.60
2. $43.20 becomes 2381.62 and then, 2381.62 becomes $38.99. How come, there is separate currency rates for transactions on same day.
3. Why wasn't i allowed to withdraw $37.99, more than your minimum limit of $35. 
4. Now, you have charged me $5 for the current project although the milestone requested is $11.25 (should have deducted $1.125) for the second project, and now i cannot withdraw my funds because the funds i have are lower than $35.
5. How can i after facing payment issues with my first project and reading your reviews and other articles on internet, be assured that i would get my money for the hardwork i have put in.

P.S. I am student, who is doing Chartered Accountant, doing freelancing to make my ends meet. I have to take care of my education and ends, as i lost my father 2 years back. I have been registered on teacherspayteachers.com and have been writing lessons for kindergarten student, so i can earn more money, haven't faced any difficulties with them for 2 months. 

It would be kind of you if you can come out with me some honest reply.  Please.",1,"“I have written to valerie about my problem, but it's...” "
1174,"I posted a project (data collection from a wiki 10k lines), found a freelancer that was very confident that he could complete it in less than a day. After awarding him the project he gave me a sample set of data, the data looked good. About an hour later he said ""done"", I was amazed. I sampled the data he gave me (about 2% of it) and it all appeared to be valid. I released the milestone of the full amount of money (here's what I did wrong). I then realized that the data was copied and pasted over and over and that he only delivered a small section of the data that the project required. After asking him about it, I got a response ""I'll look at it when I get home""... Fast forward 3 days of me trying to contact the freelancer with no response, I contact freelancer.com support to see if they can do anything about it, they say no. I put in a dispute with paypal because ""not recieving the goods or services that you purchased"" is a valid reason for a dispute. This instantly locks my freelancer.com account. I then post a review about the person and the situation he put me in. He appears all of a sudden, starting to blackmail me that I better remove the poor rating, or he'll have my account deleted. But if I do remove the rating, he'll actually give me the completed project data. I refused to be blackmailed and agreed that if I got the project data completed I would cancel the paypal dispute. Nothing came out of this, he is still sending me verbally abusive and harassing messages. So I contacted Freelancer.com support to see if they could intervene in the verbal abuse and harassment and was told that they don't have access to private messages and there's no way to block anyone. This may be a $70 life lesson to do more research on a site before you invest time or money into it. I'm left $70 less in my bank account and a project that isn't completed.",1,“I posted a project (data collection from a wiki 10k...” 
1175,"Freelancer.com is a nightmare. They are holding my money for some reason, its error after error trying to withdraw it, numerous tickets to speak to the 'support' team who are incapable of offering support if they get around to answering, often the ticket is just cancelled and i have to go the process again and again. The only emails i get are saying you have placed a ticket (yes i know) none to say if its been answered or not. Over two weeks later, I am at my wits end. There is no phone number to call and that says a lot; a company devoid of professional ethics would  need to avoid the onslaught of complaints. They took over the excellent vWorker site half way through a large writing job I was on, hence I am with a company that charges monthly buy offers nothing in return. All other sites do not charge and have great customer support. Avoid this company like the plague, Elance, Interact Media and many others are a better bet for your freelancing needs, as employer or employee. I am uncertain what to do, they have not answered a mail in days, there shows that there is no money in my account (should be $2,500) and that there is no pending withdrawal. Be careful.",1,“Freelancer.com is a nightmare” 
1176,"Freelancer.com was a very good website, before it turned into a scam.

I had earned around $10K in the past year by working as a freelancer there, and I was very happy with it. However, recently I have been facing many issues with them, and they are refusing to pay the $1500 I have in my account. It seems like scam to me. I am going to describe these problems.

1. They will reverse milestone payments whenever they want, and you cannot do anything about it. I had a milestone reversed two times. First was a $30 one, and another was $40. What it means is that after I have spent some time doing a project for an employer, sending them the job and receiving the money, suddenly freelancer.com decides to take the money you earned back!

I understand that probably the employer had used an unauthorized account for making the payment. However, Freelancer.com doesn't provide you with any evidence that the employer used an unauthorized payment source. They don't provide any documents proving that the owner of the payment source had asked for a refund. They just ask you to trust them that what they state is true. I did trust them, but I don't anymore, becuase of more issues I had with them recently that sound like scam to me.

2. Removing withdrawal requests!
There had been some instances (at least 10 times, all of them in the past 4 months) where they have decided not to process my withdrawal request, and remove it instead!

Once, I had my requests got removed for 2 weeks before I could successfully receive the money. I really don't understand what reasonable excuse they could possible have for doing so. Contacting the support in these instances shows they are 0% responsible and helpful for the issues happening for you.

The most tangible response I got from their support (I highly doubt that you can actually call it support) is that probably I have mistakenly removed the request. OK, maybe once, but not 10 times! Come on, I have been using this website for at least 8 months and made at least 20 withdrawal requests. All of them were processed flawlessly. How can I believe that suddenly, I'm mistakenly removing most of my withdrawal requests?

3. They will ask you to verify your identity by sending them some documents.
I am completely OK with providing them the documents, I understand that they have to review their customers' documents for money laundrying laws. I had my account reviewed 1 year ago. The process went very fast, and my account was verified in less than 24 hours. Cool!

But once again, my account was limited 10 days ago, and they asked for the same documents I provided them past year! Exactly the same ones! This is highly unacceptable to me. Didn't they already verify my identity? Didn't they review my documents?

I decided to go on and send them the documents. I had all of them at my disposal, except the photo with a verification code, which I had to take again because the code was changed.

It's been exactly 10 days since I had uploaded my documents. The message I received after submitting my documents: ""Your submission was successful and is now under review. Your account will remain limited until we can confirm your identity and aim to have this resolved within 48 hours.""

I was expecting the process the finish within 2 days, since it was finished in less than 24 hours last time. But I have not yet received any response from them, after 10 days!

When 2 days passed, I had created a ticket and asked them when they expect the verification to be finished. Their response:
""Hi ******,
Thank you for contacting the Support Team.
We appreciate your compliance with our requirements for lifting your account limitation.
However, you would really need to refer back to the Verification Center to follow up on your case. Kindly wait for their response.
For your convenience, the link to the Verification Center is: https://www.freelancer.com/users/limit-account/verification_center.php
Let us know if you have other concerns.""

After 5 days, I was really worried about my account, since I had $1.5K there and my account was not yet verified. I created another ticket, and guess what! They have decided not to respond to my ticket, and it was closed after 2 hours! Can you believe it? They didn't respond, and closed the ticket instead!

I became suspicious they have became a scam and all of these were to steal my money. I had searched ""freelancer.com scam"" on Google, and as you probably know, there were tons of reviews stating that the company is a scam. :(

What I noticed in some reviews was a guy named ""Valerie Scott"" providing an e-mail address, and offering assistance. Great! So I decided to contact him and ask him for assistance. He responded very fast, and I was hopeful that he could help me lifting the limits on my account. However, 4 days has passed since Valerie told me he would look into the issue as soon as possible and inform me. I have replied to his email 3 times in the past 4 days and asking him for updates regarding my issue. But he was not responding anymore.....

So this is how all my hope is lost on Freelancer.com, including $1500 I had earned. Freelancer.com used to be a reliable company and a good source of income for me, but not anymore. I don't think that they will every review my documents. It's a 5 minute job, which they couldn't perform in the past 10 days.

I am going to move on and not use Freelancer.com anymore. Even if they decide to verify my already verified account and pay me the money I've earned, I'm not wasting my time there anymore because they have proved they are extremely unreliable and I might lose time and money working there.

I also recommend everyone to avoid using Freelancer.com, it's no more worth it.

I will update this review if I could get my money, but I won't be spending more time contacting their useless support or working for employers anymore.",1,"“Freelancer.com was a very good website, before it turned...” "
1177,I was ripped off by freelancer.com.  Without my prior authorization or knowledge they took money from my PayPal account.  I had hard time canceling my account and the agent refused to credit my account.  I am taking it with PayPal now.,1,“I was ripped off by freelancer.com” 
1178,"I would be very careful using this service. They offer no type of protection against thieves who are out to rip you off. So if you get tricked by a rip off artist on here don't expect Freelancer to do anything about it. They basically told me the only way they can refund the amount that was ripped off from me was if the guy who ripped me off verified the milestones I setup. Why would he verify, let alone even reply if he is ripping me off? He won't. And even with all the verification they need right there at their finger tips they still won't refund the money nor will they take any action against the person who is ripping me and others off. 

Make sure you read all the fine print because this site harbors a ton of rip off artists and apparently their policies are setup to protect them, which makes me wonder if freelancer is simply a big rip off as well.. We pay for the service when we finish projects and freelancer gets paid off our projects, yet they won't do anything to help users acquire the money they've had stolen from them... 

Very disappointed in this ""venue"" as they call it...",1,“I would be very careful using this service” 
1179,"They are a scam site.....So far I have won two projects.  Freelancer has taken my money and I have not heard from the employers after weeks of pms to them.  When I contact freelancer.com support all they will say is no refunds.  They do not protect their freelancers.  Honestly, I think they award projects just so they can get the fees from the freelancer and rip them off.

The first project I was awarded, I was sleep when the award came.  I made the bid at 9 p.m. My time and was awarded the project at 2 am my time.  I woke up and accepted the project at 6 am.  They say you have 36 hours to accept the project it only took me four.  The project got reposted and they chose another developer in that after they chose me on the first post.  I contacted support and they just said sorry, no refunds talk with your employer.  I talked to them and they didn't do anything.

I said okay, lesson learned....never had an experience like this with scriptlance.com.  It was a bad first impression with the but I decided to give them another chance.  I was awarded another $30 project.  I accepted the project and of course they took their fee right away.  The employer has still not contacted me and I have sent many messages.  Again they say sorry no refunds.  It seems as if they make up these projects just to make money illegally and I pray their downfall will be imminent",1,“They are a scam site.....”

I was appaled when after 1 hour of chat the operative did not know what a credit note was and could not understand that if freelancer can raise an invoice for $15 and take money from my bank account or paypal and the invoice is found to be bogus either for a non existent job or some system glitch which happens often on their system then the remedy is to raise a credit note for the equivalent amount and refund the amount and the credit note should read taht it is  credit note 12345 for a reversal of xyz fee of $15 against invoive 54321 of whatever date and this is the right way, any other way is tantamount to shady accounting and loopholes for theft.

I invited my earlier worker to price the job, which he did but I could not then award the project as the site kept telling me it was not my project.
After 3 emails to support all I got were platitiudes. As I could not access my project to award it to my worker we went through a second site and the project is now underway (using Guru.com). I am still waiting for my money back and a response addressing the issue.

After making another request, the same thing happened after 2 days. I contacted the Liars, initially they said 'The client doesn't have phone verification' so the funds can be transferred. After telling them its not my job to get the phone verified. They sent me another email that my funds will be refunded soon. Then after 3 days I again asked for my payment they said ""Funds won't be transferred, as we only pay for earnings not Deposited Funds"" I got really upset. That its my MONEY which I transferred from Payoneer.com to Freelancer. The client also approved my disputed payment it got transferred to my account and now these Thieves aren't giving me my money.

1223,"I used Freelancer.com for the first time a couple of days ago and yesterday I selected a freelancer. (On the day of registration Freelancer took a $10 deposit from me).

The successful bid was $100 and the milestone was $100, so basically the freelancer wanted the full amount upfront.

When I paid the milestone their system took *two* payments: one for $97.54 and the other for $102.66. I was logged into my email account at the time and got Paypal email alerts within seconds of making the milestone payment showing these two sums.

I was completely shocked  I was flabbergasted that they took money automatically from my Paypal account (I soon read on the internet that Freelancer take money without notifying people by email that they have supposedly signed them up for ""pre-approved"" billing).

This would not have mattered so much *if* their system had not taken two payments.

I read on the internet of someone else this has happened to: their payment was duplicated *and* support tried to tell them they must have done something wrong their end. That's what happened to me. I know I definitely didn't press anything twice.

I got on to support and after alleging wrong doing my end, they basically tried to tell me that the money would be a credit on my account. At that point I admit I started swearing as they said they could not tell me if or when I'd be refunded!

I have now contacted Paypal's fraud department and they said they will investigate. I have sent them a few links and intend to put my case on as many warning sites as possible to alert people to this scam company until they refund me.

 I managed to get the telephone number of their UK Manager (I'm based in the UK) he was said he'll look into this for me. I wait and see with interest.

I would advise you to contact Paypal's Fraud department if you too were signed up to pre-approved payments without your knowledge.  

PS - They have now emailed me now and asked me to drop the Paypal dispute so that they can refund me.  DO NOT FALL FOR THIS TRAP.

1226,"Am I the only one having complains about this site? No: I personally know many who now Hate this Scam Site.

Few years back, Getafreelancer was one of my favorite freelance site. I used to work there every day for years, but then something happened to their Management: I think site was sold to some other company or the Management was given in hands of another company. Whatever, happened, I do know that the CEO was changed and the new guy is a Thief [his name: Matt Barrie aka Matt the Thief].

As this is a big company, therefore they are using complicated techniques to Rip-Off its users.

I will mentioned at least two Lies of this site:

Freelancer had an Affiliate Program from the very beginning. Years back, All the rules were clearly mentioned and there were no lies.

Then Mr. Matt took over, the first thing he did was that: he changed the rules about affiliate earnings without telling the users:

Instead of giving commissions [commission = a percentage of fee that freelancer .com earned from the users we refer] to affiliate partners for unlimited time period, they decided to limit it to the first 3 months only.

So Am I here just because of this change? No: This is just one issue of many...

I also know that they have the right to change their Affiliate Program rules. That is not the problem...
The problem starts when the Mr. CEO tries to hide this change from its users. He wants users to think that they will be getting the commissions for Ever but in reality, it has been limited to only 3 months.

The main Affiliate Program Page does not mention this change: it says that we will get the commission and it does not mention the real part.

There is a Terms of Service Page: Deep down in this page, they have added one line which mentions this change.

Why have they not mentioned this important part of their affiliate policy in the Main Affiliate Program Page?

Because They are thieves: that is why...

I personally had been sending users to their site for so many years. Everyday, I was sending 120 or so Verified/Registered users to their site via mine. If we talk about the total traffic going to their site, that is much higher.

Everything was ok till 2009, when I first noticed a drop in my affiliate earnings. I tried to find the reason but as Freelancer was hiding this info deep inside their TOS page, I failed to find the cause of my earnings drop.

But then later in 2011, my earnings dropped to almost Zero.

This is when I contacted the thieves and also tried to find the reason myself too.

Now Here is the most important part:

These thieves replied to me telling me that commissions are now given only for 3 months and this change was implemented in 2009.

But wait: after 2009, my earnings did decrease but I was still earning from the old users who I had referred. The thieves said that due to a Bug, I was still getting commissions???

The truth is that: they were giving little bit of the commissions to me so that I do not suspect anything and I fail to find their Big Stupid Change. Why did they worry about me? Because at that time, the total number of verified users in their site in 24 hours was around 1200. In this figure, my site was contributing 120 or so users.

But then in 2011, they had developed other Scam techniques. Now their site gets much more traffic: verified users everyday are around 2500 or so. SO now they do not need me or other affiliate partners.

But Wait: Freelancer is still lying. Their Affiliate Page still does not contain the 3 months limit info. They still want users to advertise their sites all over the internet so that they can get their pockets full of money and in return, they want to give nothing.

Why will they not include the 3 months limit info on the main affiliate page?

Because they want to rip-off users more and more.

Also note that: sometime in 2010 or 2011, for few days, they did add the 3 months limit rule in the affiliate page: but this info was removed after few days. When I contacted their support, their cleverly sugar coated the situation via saying that they have not made any changes in their program since 2009 and then they removed that 3 months limit part from the affiliate page.

Now if someone from Freelance reads this rip-off report and decides to prove me wrong, by adding the 3 months limit info in the affiliate program page, this can happen. But for years, they had been hiding it from users:

This is just one scam going on at freelancer: they are using sophisticated techniques to scam users:

Like their CONTEST Sh*t

Thousands of users are working hard to advertise Freelancer all over the world: majority of these users will get NOTHING in the end: by the time they realize what Freelancer is doing, it would be too late. New victims replace the old ones.

They are using different kinds of Contests to scam in different ways.

But what, if we look at the Traffic Stats of all the freelance sites, then Freelancer stands at the Top? How is this possible?

Using their scam techniques, they are using victims to get more the more traffic and earn more for themselves.

But note one thing: the most number of Scam Projects are posted at Freelancer... I had been working there for years, I know what I am talking about.

There are all types of SCAM buyers at Freelancer.

Freelancer Management's obsession about getting more traffic and seeing more projects opened in their site is making this site a garbage freelance site.

For example: if there are 1500 projects opened in one day, then may be 1000 of these projects will never end successfully: some of them will be totally useless projects that are opened by scam buyers. They call them Trial Projects.

Anyway, anyone who wants to join a freelance site: My suggestion is to stay away from Freelancer . com

There are many other Professional sites out there, like Guru . com",1,“Am I the only one having complains about this site?”

So i hired a person to do a website. Long story short. The guy did the website the way he wanted. many things didnt work. the website was really slow and i couldnt use it at all. So i complained to the website. They held the money and told me to keep talking to them and the freelancer.

so i keep taking to them for about 3 months. suddendly i wasnt getting any response anymore for about 5 months. except i kept sending emails which was ignored by both of them.

so after 5 months i receive an email saying that the money (over $200) was released to the freelancer for lack of response.

Lack of response? come on. i have email every time several times and i even chat with you guys that took us nowhere. i have proof as i send everything through gmail.

But of course they will favor the freelancer. if they give the money back to me they get zip. but if they give the money to the freelancer the get a a cut of the money.

so no wonder they don't care about the buyers. i have use so many other websites and this is one of the worst. So beware with freelancer.com. they are scamers.

specially buyers. don't go there. got to elance.com. and always pay with american express as they are very good in helping this kind of problems. lesson learned. never hire people from freelancer.com

This is something that freelancers and workers should be notified of, when it happens. Had it not been for PayPal, I would not have noticed the charge on my account.

1245,"I've used Freelancer.com for more than a couple of years and unfortunately it is one of my least trusting platforms for several reasons. First of all, there's a lot of unwanted micro-transactions going on -- taking a small amount of each credit card you enter in order for ""verification""; a lot of currency conversions during the process of getting credit (usually, it goes through 3 conversions with bad conversion rates that are unavoidable); so many limitations that appear as favorable opportunities behind a payment to the site (ex: tests, not able to bid higher priced projects without a paid-membership, etc.). They should stick to only the commissions they get from projects and the promotions like the other sites, not numerous, petty methods to profit from freelancers. The second reason I cannot recommend the site is because I feel that they are posting fake high budget projects in order to lure freelancers into paying for a premium membership. I think these are fake because these projects do not contain any information (even a job description) and are posted almost every week or so. Lastly, customer service and moderation is very bad. Theres been an issue of a freelancer posting fake projects almost everyday for a prolonged period without ever awarding the projects which I believe is to steal unreleased original musical compositions (either to get inspiration from or to steal outright), but theres been no moderation even after a few of us have reported it. Another issue is the bad platform which never seems to improve. Notifications button (and sometimes the message tab) is always lit for weeks after everything is checked.

Rip off!  What if I don't get any projects? I get to spend my money for nothing?!

Here's another one.  I believe that most employers posting their job offer is a scam.  Beware of people posting job offers that their method of payment hasn't been verified.  That's the thing about freelancer.com.  How come employers can post job offers without their mode of payment not being verified?

Here's a personal experience of mine.

2 employers contacted me for a project that they posted.  I saw that their mode of payment wasn't verified yet.

Employer #1:
Told me that I only have to do data entry.  Just do a copy typing.  It means I have to type everything that I see in an image or pdf file.  But first I have to deposit money to be able to get the job.  The amount that I will deposit depends on the plan that I am going to work on. Ex: Plan 1 = $25, Plan 2 = $32, Plan 3 = $47 and the last is Plan 4 = $62.  I told them that I won't be able to deposit the money until tomorrow.  The next day I tried contacting them. Upon emailing them, after clicking send, gmail notified me that the account has been disabled or no longer exists. I tried contacting the employer on freelancer.com's chat, but they didn't reply.  BE CAREFUL with this type of people. If you guys are wondering if I made the deposit, my answer is no. :D

Employer #2:
The employer posted a job with a good pay (upto $750).  I made a bid on that job and got the job.  The job was, I was supposed to do an data entry.  Type everything from a pdf file and save it on MS Word.  But when the employer emailed me, the employer just sent an executable file with instructions that I open the file and just type everything I see and click enter.  There was no pdf file. Still I open the executable file.  All I got is to type the captcha and click enter.  The employer will pay me $20 for every 1,000 entries of captcha.  What happened to the original offer? (dunno)

So if you plan to sign up with freelancer.com, again, ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK!
If you do, just be careful when accepting job offers.",2,“Enter at your own risk!” 
1256,"My review is for the company, not the graphic artist I chose for my project.  The bid price was $117, $119.99 with Paypal fee.  I created one ""milestone"", which is a payment that is made, but withheld from the artist until the customer is satisfied and ""releases"" the project.  I happened to check Paypal and found that I had been billed twice-  and opened up a dispute for the second charge.  I asked the artist why I had been billed twice-  he stated that I had created a ""second milestone"" (I did not)-  and he cancelled the second one.  However, Freelancer never refunded the second charge, so it is still in dispute.  Meanwhile, my Freelancer acct is suspended (because I opened a dispute), and I cannot release the project, which means my artist does not get paid and I cannot leave a review for the nice job he did.  VERY thankful I used Paypal, so I can get the extra charge refunded.  Totally unfair to the artist.  And don't get conned into the extra $29 fee for special help, not worth it.  I would have used the artist for additional projects, but won't go back to Freelancer again.  NO customer service.",2,“Be careful with this company!” 
1257,"Hey, i was rather surprised to sign in and see scams flocking me to my email. Huh!! Ruined with scams i would suggest",2,“Ruined with Scams” 
1258,"it was easy enough to get a freelancer to take care of a 2 minute code fix, but the moment he was done, he kept badgering me about payment every 7 seconds.. which inadvertently cause a triple billing in the process, and then, you have to go back to the employee to get them to release the ""milestone"".. all of which is extremely confusing to a new user, which I was.. I build websites and yet had a horrible time navigating that site, and ended up triple billed because it looks like you are billing once, and just confirming but you are actually posting multiple payments and milestones for things that don't exist and then you have a credit on the account.. so, it is partly my fault for letting the employee badger me through the payment process so he could have it immediately, but, with professionals this would never happen, in addition, when he realized he needed to release the extra milestone, he tried to force me into giving him a tip for doing so, good ethics.. and of course I didn't, so a 20.00 job, with their fees becomes 25, plus two duplicates, ends up at 60 plus dollars.. their customer service guy was nice enough, but must have been taking several calls at once and when he sorted out about 2 of the issues, he bailed mid chat.. after making me wait all that time he apparently couldn't be put upon to finish the last step with me.. do yourself a huge favor.. don't go near this service.. ugh..",2,“what a mess”

1261,I'm still using freelancer but very very stand-offish. As a somebody with cancer who loves what he has dedicated his life to which is anything programming. I wrote 2 coding tutorials and replied 3 times as the project stated. The employer talked the whole time up till the last reply the project requested. Then he simply disappeared. He has awesome review 5 stars and i filed dispute 3 years ago. never heard anything. i sent invoices and messages. Nothing. I mean it's only $50 but it was my first project ever on freelancer. so i stopped using it for a few years just recently got bored and decided to give it another go. I'm going to wait and see how this progresses. The 2 clients 1 of which i am currently working with seem ok. but the one i have which was a 2 hour job which i completed and delivered the application. tested it and has requested some improvements not in the description of the project. I'll update this review since the employer said about 7am or 8am my time he will get back to me. Still kind of stand offish on top of the fact my first withdraw should have been completed 3 years ago and these reviews kind of made me scared to continue using the site. I wasn't really upset about the $50 but not I am as it seems to be a regular occurrence on this site from these reviews and now i have $155 maybe going to be stuck there for 15 or way more days. Depending on how this goes will make or break me doing business with freelancer anymore. I mean i do freelance work around my area but I wanted to branch out since work is slowing down because not too many ppl in rural pittsburgh need software programming. and i have skills that i do in my freetime just to do. so i figured why not make some extra cash. In short I hope when I return and update this review it is positive and not following suite with the rest of these review.,2,“Been waiting 3 years on a $50 project” 
1262,"Well, not surprising for a for profit company, but after many years of inactivity i decided to give it a shot and although it was not a complete disaster, the reason for posting this is because they ognore my requests to not proceed with the prrmium services they automatically add you for a monty free try out. They setup automatic witgdrawals and when i realized of it paypal had already processed the money and my claim for withdrawal was dimissed.maybe not a total scam because i got a lead from them but you have to be very careful. Thanks",2,“Freelancer took my money” 
1263,I'm considering leaving this site. Their membership rates got higher recently and at the same time they haven't published my service since 2 months explaining  that it's due to technical service. Seriously?! How much time does it take?! Not mentioning commissions they take for literally everything! This is so unfair and unprofessional Freelancer.com! Instead of attracting people you simply make them leave.,2,“Membership rates getting higher”

1269,"UPDATE 3: if you try to take out money that you sent into your freelancer.com-account, it is extremely complicated: I waited two weeks to get the money back, then, suddenly, they told me it was a wrong request what I did and did not explain clearly what they did with the money, but the money simply disappeared from the freelancer-account. Only after filling a support request, I understood that they sent the money to my credit card, and not to my paypal, as I requested, letting me wait a few additional days (added to the already waited 2 weeks!). But when I wanted to take the money out from the freelancer account, there was no option to send it to my credit card, but just an option for paypal. Incredibly stupid! They have complicated internal rules that are not transparent, not easy to understand and not explained in advance. Only when you need a transaction, there are popping out a lot of ""you can do it just like this"" things, and the solution is always to your detriment. Considering they have millions of users, and they delay the payments from their accounts to the outside world for at least a few days, one can imagine what earnings they have just by using this money that is blocked there. They probably are able to use it permanently (in the meantime), like a bank does this too. But freelancer.com is not a bank.

UPDATE 2: I tried to use ""envato"" instead of freelancer. It worked very simple, with no unneccessary fuss regarding the payment methods and no hiring bureaucracy. They have even an escrow system, which makes it very secure. All in all it was really pleasant, compared to freelancer. And the costs were not higher (at least in my case).

UPDATE1: after being contacted in a very polite manner by another member of the support team, I will give freelancer a second chance. Still, it is difficult to understand the way the user interface works, regarding payments (at least in my case it was so!), and it is of course unpleasant to have to go through such unpleasant discussions with the support, and that only after appealing and making a case out of it, the complaint is accepted and corrected. But, who knows, perhaps it was an exception. Let's hope so. I'll give them a second chance. I will give them two stars more (3 instead of 1) and... let's see.
Anyway, I just read another complaint about the guy called David S., which was the same way of total rudeness to another customer: 

""I tried contacting support team through Chat. The Support Executive name is Dave. S and he was very unprofessional, ethic-less, rude and *****. ""

***

I just put here below a transcript of the chat I just had with a guy from the helpdesk. You can see yourself how they treat customers.

They ask for money for every little financiary step you do (each time some 5 or more), and they have a very bad user interface, which leads you to do mistakes and loose your money. There is no way to reverse wrongly done payments.

chat with ""support desk"", which is rather a ""frustrated desk"", heightening the anger of the customer that tries to contact them: 

Dave S.: How can I help?
Me: I am new here and wanted to release a milestone (start of work) but I payed the whole invoice.
Me: How can be this reversed?

19:05Dave S.: What is the ID or the URL of the project related to your concern?
19:06Dave S.: Please provide the information being requested. [! here he starts to be the ""bad guy"" - without any reason !]

Me: https://www.freelancer.com/....

Me: the project is just starting, but it is marked ""completed""! nothing was done, I was just requested by the worker I hired, to release the first milestone. (in order for him to start work)

Dave S.: This is a Fixed-Price project. Invoices can only be used for Hourly Projects. Well, we do not encourage making upfront payments. The funds that have been released can be reversed once the freelancer contacts us to give their confirmation. We always recommend employers on our site only to release Milestone Payments once the freelancer completes the project and they are satisfied with the submitted work.

Me: ok, but I am new here and I was friendly and accepted the proposed solution. AND your system told me absolute bull$#*!, that made me very confused and determined this big error.
So how can I get my money back?

Dave S.: Freelancer.com does not tolerate abusive language.
Dave S.: We have an obligation to conduct our business in accordance with all applicable rules, regulations and laws as we are committed to helping all users act in a way that preserves trust and respect within the site.
Dave S.: I suggest that you refrain from sending statements containing abusive language.

Me: The worker told me ""he is on his phone and he cannot see anything related to payments on his phone"" and that ""I should not worry"".

Dave S.: This serves as your first warning.

Me: I am sorry, but I am VERY ANGRY because your system gives contradictory advices! AND I Hope that ""customer friendliness"" includes to accept that I am really angry and have a lot of trouble because your USER INTERFACE is bad. 

Dave S.: Further violation will result in disciplinary actions.
Dave S.: The process on how the payment you released can be returned has already been advised to you.

Me: ok, so I am here in the army, or where? I did not say anything wrong about you, I told it about the system. And ""bull$#*!"" is really a usual word in english language, quite mild.
I am highly dissapointed about the way there is no customer politeness from the side of ""freelancer""!

Dave S.: Your frustration is understandable. However, it is not necessary to use such words.

Me: You could say this from the beginning, and not talk to me in this condescendent, totally unfriendly way!

Dave S.: You have been warned against using abusive language.
Dave S.: I will now have to end this chat session.
Dave S.: Feel free to email support@freelancer.com if you'd like to discuss this further.

I wanted to tell him that he is really, really a total idiot, but I could not, because he just closed the session! I was already very angry because their site gives you bad and contradictory recommendations when trying to pay someting, and then I was also being degraded to someone who just uses ""abusive language"" instead of being helped.

It turns out this is not true.
1) The employer can do a callback on their card after the milestone is paid.
-> This is understandably out of the hands of the system because Freelancer cannot control all of the original payment sources in the world.

2) If the employer talks to Freelancer support they can return the funds without providing information to the Freelancer (albeit as a new milestone paid from the Freelancers account). 
-> This needs to be worked on because it promotes abusive and potentially fraudulent activity on the site.

I recently had this happen to me.
Freelancer support told me that it was returned because the employer did a callback on their payment method. Freelancer support then moved the funds from my account and added it back as a new milestone for the employer. The employer asked me to do extra works to receive the funds they already had given me, but took back (Freelancer support returned to them).

A dispute was started and the Freelancer dispute team decided to give the milestone once paid, but some how returned as a new milestone, back to the employer. Total time working for this employer 20 hours. Originally posted milestones $200 USD. Released milestones $100. Milestone lost in dispute $100 + $5(dispute fee). Released Milestone returned as a new milestone $100. Re-posted milestone lost in dispute $100 + $5 (dispute fee).  I received -$10 & - 20 hours. The employer received free work and front end code that they can use anywhere as much as they want. 

I am still dumbfounded that I lost the dispute in spite of the fact that the employer is using the code on their publicly viewable site, screenshots, messages from the employer saying ""it looks good"", ""wait why we post it to production"", ""Great job""... Even after I lost they are still using my code free of charge ): The dispute team works in mysterious ways.... But setting this aside..

Why have a policy posted if your own team does not follow it? Why so one sided? Nearly no information was provided to me, and when it was it was an inquisition.

Support: ""Please provide evidence that the employer was satisfied with the work you've done and that it's completed""
Me: ""They released the milestone! Why would they do that unless they were happy with the work?""

-> Really? The employer should be asked why they released the milestone if they were not satisfied. If they have a really good reason like ""I accidentally pushed the button"". ""Someone has hacked into my account."" etc, a refund may be in order. In other cases the support team should not even attempt to contact the freelancer for evidence of ""satisfaction"" when the employer pushed a button. This is a loaded question biased in favor of the employer. 

De facto policy: ""Once the Milestone Payment is released there are ways for us to recover the funds.""

[UPDATE 2016-01-29]
After discussing this with support they clarified that they returned the milestone from released to pending. It was not due to employer payment issues. I hope they let management know that they should change the policy posted on the site. To let users know that milestone payments can in fact be returned to the Employer after they are released. They may get more projects posted by having this corrected information.

So in practice anyone can post a project with milestones set up like this and get work done for free.
Milestone 1: Prototype
Milestone 2: Second working copy
Milestone 3: Last milestone

You can then release 1 & 2 to keep the Freelancer working. At the end you can ask for whatever you want. New additions, extra functions, why not create a whole new code set for the Freelancer to work on? (this is what happened to me). And by not releasing Milestone  three you go into arbitration. Since their is no complete version by the employers definition, and by clever manipulation (for example stalling the project over the deadline by simply not messaging the freelancer for a few weeks), you can ensure that you win.

After winning your arbitration you can ask Freelancer to return all of the funds, even milestones that were released previously. Based on a process that is not stated on the site you will be refunded and left with the product FREE of charge.

Who knows how this refund process is decided. I have a few guesses. But it is certainly not written on the site.

1)  the employer and support team are from the same country
2) the employer complains enough to where support just wants them to close the issue ASAP.
3) Someone in support thinks that breaking the written policy on the site, is a good idea in this case.
4) Someone in support thinks that giving the case to the dispute team is a better idea than just telling the employer ""No. It can't be done! Released milestone cannot be retrieved as posted on the site"".

I think (4) happened in my case and it should be brought to the attention of management. I am keen to see this issue resolved to make Freelancer more secure for, well, freelancers.",2,“Milestone releases are NOT FINAL.”

1275,"I was looking for my web project for a site and came by Freelancer.com. I went through it and notice there were quite  some projects .  So I made an account and added my project. So far so good but then we I add my cc for validations problems started. CC was validated but the money for the project milestone was refused. After several attempts freelancer support desk contacted me and advise that my bank refused the transaction. So in order not to slow the project I chose for wire transfer in Europe. I copy the data show in freelancer description and did the wire transfer. This was my biggest mistake. Couple hours later my Bank fraud division called me that there were several attempts from an suspicious company to collect money from my cc. I told them that I did tried to do the transition myself but figured that there must be something wrong with the site as I never had it before that my back is blocking my transactions.  So I got worried regarding my transaction and contacted Freelancer on the wire transfer. They asked me for print screens and data but also after remainders they did not respond. I have check with my bank and they advise that the money has been received by the bank in Germany so it should show on my freelancer financial account which is not the case.
I must say that the freelancers on the site look legit and are will to work on the project but freelancer.com is a different story . I have not seen a support desk in years from a proper company that is not responding to finical issues so slow or not at all.

1282,"Freelancer refuses to resolve my problem. Instead, I keep getting messages from Freelancer that my account has been 'temporarily suspended' because they allege I owe them money. Here's what happened.  I responded - first experience with a major project - to ghostwrite a book for a client.  I thought I followed the instructions but apparently I failed. The client accepted my proposal, we had a limited exchange and then she dropped off the face of the earth. Then Freelancer asked for money from me, based on a percentage of what I would have earned on the project. I responded that the project never happened. Their response was that I should have checked whether the client had paid a milestone amount into their account.  I checked then, no, no money. I tried to contact her - she said something had gone wrong with Freelancer accepting her payment.  I got nowhere with the client or with Freelancer.  

It's too bad because I used to pick up a fair amount of work from them - in fact, it was the beginning of a new ghostwriting career.  I don't believe it is incompetence or procrastination or anything like that. I believe it is their business model - to create bizarre constraints in the process of obtaining work and payment and then to thumb their noses at you when you complain.

It is my view that I owe them nothing because the contract never materialised.  I've repeatedly requested that we attempt to resolve this issue and have been resoundingly ignored.

Hello Boris, 

Thank you for contacting us back. 

We understand your concern about the payment released to you by your previous employer. However, this is part of the verification process and will help avoid issues once you have withdrawn the funds. Note that the employer always has the option to create and release the Milestone Payment. However, there are some instances where we need to make verification to make sure that the payment can be processed well. 

As a recommendation for this, we still recommend waiting for them to complete the verification. Note that this is important so they can complete the requirements and for you to process the withdrawal. 

If you have more questions, feel free to contact us back.

1289,"My experience with Freelancer was a few years ago but I can still recall my bewilderment when I found all the unexpected Freelancer fees on my credit card.  When I contacted Freelancer (e-mail only) all they told me was that these fees were something I had had supposedly agreed to (to put my job needs up front or on the fast track, etc.) by clicking on one thing or another.
I told the Freelancers people that the fees which should have been clearly visible and upfront on their website were all but completely masked by a very confusing set of options and unclear pricing information, which in hindsight I felt might have even been somewhat intentional or at least not designed in the clients' best interest in terms of being clear and simple.  For that reason I felt they had failed to provide full disclosure.
I came away with the strong impression that the Freelancer site at that time (don't know what it's like now) was more about their bottom line (making money) than it was about making sure clients clearly understood all the fees that would be incurred.

Earlier, I was attempting to take exams on the site as a means of making myself more attractive to employers. After getting a 98% on my English exam, I decided to try and get a 100%, just because. Well, there are a few problems.

1. All questions are submitted by users when they have made a high enough score on any exam. There is no guarantee the questions are accurate. I've ran into plenty of unanswerable questions ranging from simple spelling errors to flat-out inaccurate questions with wrong answers flagged as correct. There are even questions that technically have no right answer.

2. When reaching the exam screen for an exam you've already taken, there is a hyperlink next to your previous score that says ""Let's beat it!"" At the bottom of the page there is also a buy option for the exam. Click ""Let's beat it!"" takes you directly to your exam to attempt to beat your own score. Just one problem: YOU ARE CHARGED FOR THE EXAM AGAIN, WITHOUT ANY PAGE OR WARNING IN BETWEEN YOU CLICKING THE LINK AND TAKING THE EXAM. I racked up $20 worth of charges before realizing that I was being charged.

3. After realizing this, their support has yet to contact me about their effectively rigged exams AND the money they took from me.

There is zero transparency about how the site handles your money, and reviewing the site further, they seem to charge many users with tons of different fees.

The moment I receive my payment, I'm removing my personal info, delinking my Paypal, and never looking back. (And should they decide to deny me a refund, I plan on disputing it through Paypal.)

I WASN'T EVEN ABLE TO START MAKING MONEY OR EVEN BID ON A PROJECT BEFORE I WAS IN THE RED.

With over 400 projects completed (and 400 highly paid projects, not $30 projects with a team to pay) as an individual and a 5 star rating I had it all. Then, the greed started rolling in. Initially they started boosting up the prices and lowering what they offered in return. They started re-doing the website, for the worse, adding new unnecessary features just to attract people to bid on projects. They focused on QUANTITY over QUALITY. The Freelancer.com website turned in a market, a wild chaotic market where you just had to PAY in order to have greater chances to win a project. The prices of the packages rose incredibly fast and the changes from 2 months ago made me quit Freelancer.com, transfer all of my 40+ STANDARD CLIENTS that had opened jobs with me, that paid ~300-400$ per month, each to direct payment via PayPal or to other oursourcing websites. It's drastic how they want to enforce a ""cleaner, professional, bla bla"" website, and how they want to steal money off us like we're stupid and don't notice anything. First of all, if you had the notification e-mail off: YOU WERE NOT NOTIFIED ABOUT ANY CHANGES, so my membership price jumped from ~$50 -> $200 without me knowing. I had a lot of money on the account and didn't even notice at that time, it was just now when I emptied my account that I noticed it authorized PayPal to charge me $200. I was in shock and disbelief, angry and disappointed. I went and disputed, managing to take the last $200 back but not for the previous months that I unknowingly paid. They used to have people ""check your projects"" before they go live, but since they don't want to invest in a better community they're getting ~500 spam projects EVERY DAY and TONS of projects where the users are trying to scam you into paying them via PayPal/Moneybookers. I've been reporting these projects as crazy but they go out after a hour or so, so the scammers have enough time to scam innocent people. All of this could improve by hiring people to check the projects, after 1 month they'd have 50% less projects but they'd have a better community. Is this what they want? NO!

1295,"LocalVox Media is a relatively new start-up. I say 'relatively', because they've been around for about 5 years and they have a great idea and a great focus, but what they've ended up with is more of the same. 
They sell access to an online interface that allows small to mid-size businesses to manage all their social media accounts and their blog from a main directory that is very well-indexed with all the SEO bells and whistles. Sounds great, right?
Yes and no. 
First, a lot of how they attract their clients is through cold calling small businesses and trying to sell them subscriptions, which isn't bad - have to get the word out somehow - but it definitely colors this business more on the customer service/sales side of the tech spectrum.
The other thing about this business is their wacky way of hiring writers. 
The company sells subscriptions that include two articles per month, hand-written by a writer, according to their specifications, for which the client pays $100 p/article (the writer gets $20 per).
Writers are treated like short-order cooks in this scenario. If the client doesn't like an article, it can get sent back, for which the writer DOES NOT GET PAID. Or, they can ask for edits, for which the writer DOES NOT GET PAID.
I'm a writer, and I've worked for radio and newspapers and have gone through editing processes before, and I don't know what to say about this place, because there is NO PROOFREADING PROCESS. So, if you have grammatical errors, the article is not long enough or there is some other error (especially if the writer is available and can fix it) - THE WRITER DOES NOT GET PAID.
To make matters worse, the woman assigning me the work was very uncommunicative, writing me one or two words when she could have been working with me to build a long-term freelance relationship. As such, I often didn't know I was doing anything wrong until invoice day WHEN I WOULD NOT GET PAID!

Problems with freelancer:
1. Poor escrow system. The majority of developers insist on cash up front (""Milestone Released""). I haven't had a dispute so far and don't know why this is the case.
2. Freelancer ""live chat"" is offline more than half the time. When talking with a live chat person, they have been proficient in English, but are limited in what they can do. When trying to resolve something that I thought would be simple, I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told he was too busy.
3. The Freelancer payment system is clunky and confusing. The submission page that gives permission to withdraw from paypal always asks for a lesser amount than what is actually taken (I assume due to fees, but so far I haven't been able to reconcile it). If I am clicking Submit on a form saying $25.00 will be withdrawn from my paypal account, it shouldn't be withdrawing $25.61. I've also had small charges pulled, without warning, from my Paypal account when releasing an escrow payment to the employee. No warning is given that money is about to be withdrawn from my account.
4. I don't know why this is exactly, but when posting a job on Freelancer I get many bids that are copy/paste blurbs of text and huge irrelevant portfolios from people who clearly haven't read the job description. On Elance I get very specific questions, often with relevant portfolio work. I have a large number of reviews and am rated 5.0/5.0 on both sites so am not sure why this is.
5. All of the help and form submission pages on Freelancer could be improved by having an editor or technical writer review them. It's frustrating to spend time trying to find an answer to basic question (like What is the Milestone payment system?), only to discover confusing explanations with poor and inconsistent prose across the site. 

All that said, several reviewers on SiteJabber have claimed Freelancer.com is a complete scam. I don't think that is true - in my opinion the owners/management of Freelancer.com have good intentions. I'm writing a negative review, and have been in contact with the Freelancer staff regarding my review, and do not fear of account retribution or anything crazy like that. I've always been able to get any issue or confusion resolved, although so far it's generally been a slower and more annoying process with Freelancer.com versus eLance.

1300,The site has its flaws I probably won't use it again because of the issues and the freelance workers. The workers lie about qualifications just to get you to hire them. Im sure it cant be everyone but its a good number. I would suggest they screen the eligible workers on the site to give more security to the buyers. The customer service through email. is good and they tolerate the complaints though they should since its the consumers. I would give them a 3 out of five only because you can't speak to anyone if you are in the united states or canada which is terrible. Because my trust was destroyed by hiring someone I give a 35 percent chance I will give them another try but you can at you own risk. If they improve these things it will be much better. Just be careful who you hire and ask to see what work they've done before hiring. If not for the customer service being through email and bad service throught the freelancers I'd give this site a 3 and a half,2,“The site has its flaws I probably won't use it again...”

We found Freelancer to be easy to get someone to start the work. Almost impossible to get one to finish it. We have a 95% finished site and can't get them to finish. So now we are forced to find yet again another developer to come in an the last minute to try and pick up the pile of $#*!e left behind by these unprofessional bloodsucking parasites. Better off to pay someone in your own country that actually has some work ethic and understands the importance of customer service and finishing what you accept as a contract.

1307,"Freelancer.com is not a scam. But their service is TERRIBLE. I was a first time user and put up a project for about 550 US$. I actually found quite a good designer who did a decent job, but the website itself caused me a lot of trouble (not the working with the designer). They are totally intransparent on what they charge. They upgrade your profile automatically to one where you have to pay if you don't notice it yourself and downgrade manually (they don't ask). They renewed my project automatically, and then wanted to charge me 5 bucks to close the renewed project I never wanted in the first place. I had trouble paying my designer because my credit card didn't go through. From my end everything was ok, but they just didn't claim the money from visa so it left my designer hanging for a long time. Their payment system was really bad. It never told me whether my card was accepted and whether payments went through. That made me really nervous because I didn't want to pay twice. So I always had to phone up my credit card company to check what was going on. 
Overall, I got the freelancer I wanted and the work done. But boy, was it a lot of trouble with freelancer.com. I wouldn't be surprised if they go out of business.

1308,"I have completed more than 170 projects on freelancer.com freelancing website.
I have 24% repeat hire rate and my clients loves me. When I reach at $1400+ revenue each month and my rating started growing, the freelancer.com started stealing my money each month. 

The method:

What they do. they post few fake projects by themselves. Workers bid on the projects and they take the %age right away from the worekrs hard earned money. I did the same and a client hired me. I provided him the work and he sent me the payments.  After few days when I requested a withdrawal, I noticed that 128$ are less. When I carefully saw my transaction history I found a terrible thing, I saw that freelancer.com has stolen my funds and wrote"" Reverse payment"" in the transaction history. When I contacted them and complaint about this stealing they said sorry and said the client you have worked with has charged back. 

When I asked what about my work which I have done and the money he sent was through your ""GUARANTEED"" milestone.. where is your guarantee?

They said you should contact to the client directly. And you know what ?? when I went into the past project tab, the project and the client history was deleted from the freelancer.com....!! Yes  that's what they do when you grow on the site and be loyal and do not work outside.

I am the person who has reported hundreds of projects and the clients who breaches their policies and what I got??  And they started doing this every month.

Last month I had a argument with the freelancer.com customer support and warned them against their illegal money stealing habit.

And the next morning my account was suspended due to ""SECURITY REASONS""
* I was already a verified user with the verified batch and 20 level. See their joke??

I was already not happy with their system because they do not provide the workers an access to see the client's data at the first place. And they put the fake projects by themselves to get the freelancer's money.

Whenever I send an email to them to tell me about my account issue they kept sending me the messages like:

""We understand your urgency to have this issue resolve. We can not provide yo any estimated time. Thus, as an extension of our assistance, a follow up email has been sent to the appropriate team for an update. Rest assured that you will be notified once we receive feedback from them.""

*To this date, my case is still ""UNDER REVIEW"" by their genius support team.

Please keep yourselves away from fraud freelancing websites and if you have any evidences of fraud please do contact me because if they will not return my 1700$ back to me, I will go to court and get their website banned. They are fraud and money eaters.

I think we should take a step ahead and file a compliant in our local courts to ban the fraud website.

I have a list of videos, screenshots and the conversation proves in which I can show the court who the steal the money, and even they can put the hold on your funds and name it ""security reasons""

Anybody can contact me if he or she has any evidence of their fraud. Pleas do not work on the sites like freelancer.com  It is a fraud.

I will keep you updated on the progress on my Suspended and ""UNDER REVIEW"" account status. As right now they are enjoying interest of my 1700$",2,“I have completed more than 170 projects on freelancer.com...”

Client released payment after getting work but after sometime client reversed the payment via paypal or credicard. Even these payments are done from freelancer.com account. Then freelancer.com should take responsibility for payment. Client reversed my $300 from freelancer.com. freelancer.com staffed deducted these $300 from my account and told me we don't take responsibility. if they don't take responsibility then why they charge project fee or gold membership cost $49.  All other things are okay but too risky too work here.,2,“Worst experience is that they have not authentic payment...” 
1311,I hired a freelancer name aslanyanartak2 to build a website.  I set of a milestone payment of $40 dollars to be release when half of site was completed and reviewed and I have yet to have that obligation met. The remainder would be paid upon site completion by aslanyanartak2 (The Freelancer) has failed to deliver completion of half of site for review and instead sent me to the following link: http://example223.16mb.com/ which only showed an basic word press theme that in no way reflects the requirements to receive milestone amount that he has the nerve to request to be released. Freelancer need to screen these fly by night Freelancers who represent their business in a negative light. I am very unhappy with this experience and most likely will never use Freelancer.com ever again.,2,“Freelancer.com needs to screen These Fly By Night Freelancers.” 
1312,"This review is only obliquely about freelancer. I got an email invitation from them. It has to be because about three weeks ago I was told about elance.com and signed up there. I had completed 90% of their enrollment, all that was left was to send them a pic of my Driver's License and a Skype interview. So glad I didn't give them more sensitive info and I'm glad that I didn't get any jobs (headaches) from them either. All I lost was the time it took to enroll there and take some tests on video production. Then there was the daily looking and bidding for jobs... that never amounted to anything. 

So back to Freelancer... I got an email invitation and it came in Italian (I sort of speak Italian, but in no way on a level to do business). Still, before even thinking of clicking on the ""accept invitation"" I wanted to see what others thought of them first, so I ended up here. 

Funny, the exact same kind of complaints that can be found about elance.com are the ones I'm reading about Freelancer... No Thank You. 

Caveat Emptor",2,“This review is only obliquely about freelancer” 
1313,"I believe with freelancer.com you must proceed with caution. What we've had happen to us is the freelancers will place a bid amount and once you award them the project often times they immediately will quote a different price and tell you that you have to repost the project.  I hired a freelancer on the site to design a site for $5000 dollars,(he originally had placed a bid for $3000 dollars then right after said it will actually be $5000)  after the freelancer took more than 50% of our money and we only had less than 10 percent of the site competed thus far, the freelancer asked for more money and upon further research we found that he had complaints under his real name for basically building a defective site that wont work . We also found reports from other sites that allegedly freelancer.com freelancers will hire each other for fake projects so they can leave each other fake feedback. I filed a claim with my bank and sent an email to freelancer customer service 5 days ago and have not received a reply back. Needless to say, we feel we have been scammed.",2,“I believe with freelancer.com you must proceed with...” 
1314,"As a 3 year old freelancer with around 250 projects I can't say I have ""ALL GOOD"" words for them. First of all many of you may think they're scammers but what they're actually is LAME WITH SUPPORT. Their ""online support"" will just use the pre-made asnwers to help you solve issues and if they can't, then they'll just spam a answer like: ""We don't refund, please lodge a ticket, bla bla.""

One of my projects is still oppened, it was actually finished over 1 year ago but the system bugged and even though the full payment was made they didn't close the project. When I went to the support site they told me ""We can't do nothing about it"". I contacted the employer (last online 1,5 year ago) and he'll never come back, the project is still open...

Now, I've also had issues with employers and employees that you can't leave a negative feedback UNTIL YOU PAY THE FULL AMOUNT, and even then, if they don't leave a feedback for you - YOU STILL CANT SHOW YOUR TRUE OPINION.

I did start this reviewing with a 4 star but then I realized that there's a lot of stuff I just remembered and it fell to two, they don't deserve more.

Bugs - I found a bug that will let me see all hidden bids (sealed) and they lured me to telling them what's the bug, after that they never contacted me back with any ""thank you"". (The issue was fixed afterwards).

I did get contacted from Matt Barie himself (if it wasn't some kind of fake account - seemed legit) asking for my username but never got any thanks.

They invented a system that will allow you to earn some credits and use them, OK, but I see some guys having like 2,3 milion credits and when I find them, they have less projects than I do. (BUGGZ EVERYWHERE!)

They also fixed another Chat bug after I reporeted it, not say they exploit users to tell them the bugs by organizing contests ""3x $100 for top bugs and suggestions"" and then they just fix all of the reported ones.

ALL ABOUT CONNECTIONS - I am a professional Swedish translator, been contacted by an employer at Freelancer.com (from Phillipines) that actually OUTSOURCED the translation of the site - WHAAT? They didn't hire any kind of certified company, they actually decided to outsource this, and since 99% of the support is actually from Phillipines (cheap cheap cheap, bad service) they were able to earn a lot of money from that, offering to pay me a couple of houndreds and getting around a coulpe of thousands of dollars  for the project. Bull$#*!!

Now, I won't go down to 1 star because there's still something good there but, this is the lowest and most realistic. It wouldn't be hard for them to earn good reviews here, they just pay a couple of Indian data entry guys and IT'S DONE!

Play smart with them, you can earn money, but don't expect much, they're not so professional as, let's say Elance.com and oDesk.com (MUCH BETTER ARE THESE TWO)

I have not used my account for over a year and now they start stealing my money by abusing the billing agreement. 

Over a year ago I found a great coder and a great designer through freelancer.com and I was a happy customer. Until this happened! So be warned before you sign a billing agreement with them!",2,“I have the same bad experience as a lot of other users” 
1317,"Working in Freelancer for over a year now... Earlier it used to be good, good projects, not much fake stuffs and minimal scammers. 

There also used to be even better places to work for like Scriptlance, VWorker, etc.

But God cursed us freelancers by supporting Freelancer.com too much for that. And as a result what happened is they acquired Scriptlance and VWorker (hence closing 2 amazing portals from where we used to get jobs) and then make a huge mess of everything.

Ever since then, Freelancer.com has COMPLETELY (I repeat, COMPLETELY) worked for maximizing their profits without caring about the professional side of the work. They DO NOT value the work which the site is intended for. Recently I saw they even added a button called ""Post a Project like this"" next to all projects posted on Freelancer.com. I do not find any Logical reason behind this button when there already is one button to do that, right on the Top Menu.

Secondly (the most important point), there are over 80% scammers on Freelancer.com. And I suspect 50% of them are initiated from Freelancer.com staff only in order to generate revenue by posting fake projects and letting them award. They don't give job after that, project gets aborted and ultimately the fees deducted from the freelancer's account counts as profit for Freelancer.com. I suspect this a lot. Thank god I am a web developer and I don't get as much fake jobs, but I really pity for the content writers on Freelancer. They get almost 95% fake jobs. They hardly get a good opportunity!

And I wonder what do the review / moderation stuff do when the project is in review process... Busy throwing pancakes at each other??

Their support services are bull$#*!. Their tickets never ""actually help"" and they always ignore when we try to get deeper into the matter. I mean, what the hell? They already charged us for accepting the project, now if we abort it our profiles will get a negative impression of the ""completion rate"". What then?

Freelancer.com has forgot to care about the Freelancers and have become a profit-harvesting demon. They are just after the money, nothing else matters. They are a disgrace in the name of online outsourcing and job seeking.

I still continue working for the real platforms like Elance.com, PPH and Odesk.com. They still have lots of amazing jobs to offer and minimal scam.

They truly truly lack proper professional approach and customer support. Imagine if companies were giving support like this in an airplane, or imagine if Apple was giving this kind of support?

Edit #2: After 6 days the ""recruiter"" from freelancer.com contacted me with the following message: 

""Hi thereThe success of your project solely lies in your consistent communication with the freelancer. I encourage you to have a quick chat with them so you can check if they have additional questions regarding the project.
Let me know how this goes.""

They have issued a refund. I can't retract this review though because this is the 2nd time support has told me they couldn't refund and it's taken a bad review or taking that extra step to receive money back.

Thanks to the member of staff who has taken care of this for me though.

*Update: October 24th 2017
Recently advised that the fee refund was a ""one-time"" deal. So this company's policies are truly broken and preying on the necessity for freelancers to seek employment and making it more or less a gamble. I did everything in my power to ensure my client was happy before being awarded the job, and once awarded and I accepted it, my fee was deducted and the client shortly after cancelled leaving me with lost time and earnings.

This is a serious issue, no money should be taken until funding is secured from the client. I not see that any real service being truly rendered.

**update: October 24th 2017
Yet again was awarded a job after providing a very time extensive demo for the prospective client. They approved the demo and asked me to extend it. I was awarded job. Charged fee. I delivered the updated work as scheduled and they immediately cancelled job with no explanation leaving me out of time and pocket. I'm hoping someone from the Freelance team and address this updated review. 

**Update September 2017
After addressing this issue through TrustPilot, I was able to contact Freelancer again and am now in the process of obtaining a refund. I shall leave this review on here as initially I was told this was not possible, but I do want to extend my thanks to the team member who dealt with this since my post on here!

2016
I used Freelancer for approximately a year or so. I was awarded one job on it when I initially started out which kept me using it.

I was awarded a job for $1000. Freelancer immediately took $50 fee from me as the contractor and the client was not to be heard of again.

Freelancer does not vet nor require client details, nor request funding of a project prior to taking their fees from the contractors, meaning you can lose out big time.

You will not be reimbursed as per their terms.

This company is a sham.",3,“Freelancers paying when awarded by insecure clients.” 
1355,"I signed up with Freelancer and immediately awarded 2 projects. The first had to be revised and getting the payment ""milestone"" adjusted properly was a nightmare until Troy C from chat support stepped in and manually made the adjustments my freelancer and I wanted. So instead of my having to shell out more money and wait for the original milestone to be refunded all was credited properly. Thank you again Troy C. 

The 2nd project the freelancer was awful. He didn't communicate, did work he wasn't supposed to do and didn't do any work within the scope of the project. Again chat support came to the rescue, advising me how to properly make a dispute and I got the milestone money back the same day.

Because all these issues took so much of my time away from getting work done I probably won't use Freelancer again.

I went to cancel my membership, but it only took me to the membership tier page with no option to cancel, even after I followed the instructions from the help page on how to do it. I entered into the live chat option and discussed my predicament and was refunded, which I am very thankful for since I saw no results from the professional membership in the free month.

I accepted a job that was a scam and before I was paid by the scammer, my account was charged 10% of the job.  I think that's bad for business on Freelancer's part.  One could start to think that Freelancer has scammers trolling on purpose to add to their own payroll.  The user experience of the site is TERRIBLE!  It's not concise or user friendly, and if you need help . . . you'll be jumping through hoops to get it.  The chat button doesn't take you to a chat, instead a FAQ/search bar, and you'll go around in that circle for about 3 times, I'm still not sure how to get to a chat immediately without hitting it several times.  Thankfully I only had to use the chat twice.  I did get to the email option eventually as well.  Someone responded in 2 days, I responded back and I still haven't heard from him.  All in all, I'll be ending my account.  Craigslist will be better option than this.  The only reason I gave this review 2 stars, I did get my money back, but that was after having to throw a tantrum via chat.

Odds of finding a good one has dropped considerably. Have used many freelancers over the last few years. Choosing the right freelancer for the job is tough.

Next minute they say this is a low budget and request more money, or they ask you to release milestone before they start. Majority just want to be awarded the job regardless if they know what they are doing or not. This is a BIG problem! Majority don't follow instructions. One freelancer wiped out an entire site with a canned demo and I had to restore from backup. Opened a dispute and they asked why did you open a dispute? I give all freelancers a chance. When communications is poor and they don't follow instructions I file a dispute. Feel Freelancer.com should not fool around. When a dispute is filed and communication shows evidence of complaint they should refund milestone and terminate freelancer. NO freelancer should be able to open an account without being verified.

1386,"I have serious concern .
I made a dispute request https://www.freelancer.com/dispute/disputestage.php?id=227116

Employer as shared ZERO Evidence of his claims yet he has won . Now the employer also can leave incomplete project (which will be 1st incomplete project ) .

The project is completed successfully . But i dont understand why the freelancer team has not favored us. 

What's the point of having a dispute team if they dont even look at the evidence given ??? So this means any employer after project is complete can just write i dont like website without evidence and can win this ????

We lost freelancer dipute fee + project cost .

I don't know freelancer team read my comments as i clearly told employer extended the project to more than 2 months and dint pay us . But the dispute team has given me the reason
""A. The project is all about building a life coaching website for the buyer. Both of them agreed that the project would cost $500 USD, and it should be finished within 5 days[1]."" - [Preeya - The employer clear extended . evidences have been provided for the same.Even employer has confirmed the same ]
B. The seller failed to impress the buyer through the design of the website they made[2]. Based upon the conducted investigation, it appears that both of them agreed to opt on the first option the seller presented, which is creation of a full milestone and it would be released upon the completion of the project[3]. Having that said, the buyer is not compelled to release. - [Preeya - Evidence is provided the site exatly like the site he asked]
C. Completion of a Project, means not only completing the project Per Se, but also making sure that the buyer wold be happy and satisfied with the output the seller would submit. - [Preeya - We competed the project . EMPLOYER has not given an specific part what he does like in the website even after asking him several time , Evidences is provided]

D. Findings also shows that the buyer did not like with how the website looked and felt[4]. As this is a part of project completion process, the seller should maintain a high quality of communication to avoid misunderstanding. Also, the seller should have chosen to address the buyer's issue on the project, since the satisfaction of their buyer would ensure that they would be compensated; thus, concluding the project properly.
- [Preeya - We competed the project . EMPLOYER has not given an specific part what he does like in the website even after asking him several time , Evidences is provided. it was done extacly like sample website he shared . ]

E. Milestone payments are ought to be released, in line with the buyer's satisfaction on the project outcome. It covers the quality of the project, its adherence to the buyer's preferences, along with the ability of the seller to finish the project within the allotted time frame. Since it was evident that the seller failed to conclude the project properly by fixing the issues on the website[5], it is rightful and just to refund the disputed Milestone Payment to the buyer.
- [Preeya - Employer as shared ZERO Evidence . And i have provide all details . How did they conclude this ??]

2 Weeks before this a recruiter porject amount was reversed .
The project was closed and milestone was released 4 months back . This was a recruiter project and yet you remove amount from our account with no fault of ours ........

1387,"I've earning from this site from last 8-9 years. It's not bad but now-a-days very worst arbitrator. They suck your money. Very high 10% commission although it's not a issue to pay this high fee, but in return what they pay to you. 

Buyer can easily get thousand of dollar job free of cost from you. Even they deposit full amount in milestone. I bet seller can't do anything even they've ""dispute"" system which is actually for ""Buyer"" to get their money back from milestone. Their arbitrator do unfair justice. 

I know many buyer complain their money sucked by seller. Believe me seller always in loose their money then you. 

Ok come to the point. How to get a job done free at Freelancer.com.

For Buyer:
1. Post your job and deposit milestone whatever seller say but don't release the same.
2. For safer side better to deposit minimum amount that you agreed and want to cheat the seller.
3. The moment you get finished job from the seller.. go to the next steps.

4. Mention in the board you're unhappy with the job, even though you or the jobs done as per the project brief, even though initially you agreed the the jobs ok.  Later in BIG LETTER"" DISLIKE"" SHOW unhappy and whatever you can do. No need to point what's wrong
5. Don't discuss further with seller and file dispute

6. In dispute systems show you're unhappy, dislike etc.
7. On day 3 pay dispute fee to freelancer i.e. $5.
8. On Day 4 or 5.. You'll see the dispute is in your favor..Seller lost the money.

Oh I forget, You also need to post some fake few dollars project before you file the dispute. If you're already did couple of job, then it's more chance then you're winning.

There is BIG loop holes in the Freelancer.com. They do unfair justice with the seller, even though seller is right and delivery is 100% ok. 

The quote is: 

""Make a circle but it s/b look like a square""

1388,"I have to admit until I faced with a problem I actually really enjoyed using Freelancer.com.  I guess when you get problems and see how they take care of it, that's when you realize if they care about their customer or not.

So I've been finding jobs at Freelancer.com and recently I was offered a job specifically to me.  But it turned out it was a scam posting and because the budget of the ""job"" was $600 US I was charged $60US by Freelancer.com as a fee.  Basically I paid $60 to Freelancer.com to get scammed.  I was very upset because, you know nobody likes to be scammed, and money is tight right now.  So I contacted customer support and went through live chat.  Well this Scott H I talked to was very arrogant and basically they must have this manual to type when someone contacts them.  He wasn't helpful at all and all I got was getting annoyed and more upset.  Sure the fee I had to pay was mentioned on User agreement that Scott H nicely pointed out.  He even said they verify all the job postings but then how I ended up getting an offer of the fake job (And I accepted and lost $60???? )  I am very, very upset and this customer support person made me realize that I can't trust Freelancer.com, and I'm at the point wondering if I should delete my username.

I think this could all be prevented if Freelancer.com only charge the fees once the job is completed and money was paid by employer.

2. Don't buy any test to take ( They are useless ) Clients barely see them.But don't miss the opportunity of taking tests when freelancer offer them as free of cost . Happened to me many times .

3. Dont Bid on all projects you see on freelancer . Just bid on verified clients . I do expect that you might miss some new clients but there is less possibility of getting scammed if you choose to work with verified client with 1-2 jobs completed.

4.DONT WORK WITHOUT MILESTONES FUNDED . set up yours milestone and always ask client to release the freelancer fee ( On fixed price projects) before even you start working . which can be 3% to 15% of project cost depends upon your membership . Also on hourly jobs don't work without milestones hours funded . This is very important 99% of the time you save yourself getting scammed from scammer clients .

5. Verify your profile before you start working on this site so save some hassle with site like Withdrawal or dispute process .

Fortunately the Freelancer support team helped me out with this one. Like a sulking kid, he paid me. He told me to give a 5 star review and he will do the same for me. I kept my end of the bargain but he gave me a 1 star review instead (a total sore loser). 

I think he has done this to a lot of other Freelancers as well. Avoiding payment then he blackmails them for 5 star reviews.

1393,"I used freelancer.com to bid on several different projects and thought I had really begun something promising when Merschen Cord reached out to me and offered the virtual art assistant job, an ongoing project. The initial emails were his offering the project, telling of the way the pay would be ($300 per week paid on each Friday), the work days and times, and working out the instructions for my first task (setting up a website at six.com to showcase his products). I worked for one week to get this website to his approval, then set up merchant accounts (linked to my personal bank account) through square up.com and approval.com. Other than the email contact, I set up an yahoo messenger account that Merschen used to communicate with me on a regular basis. Every now and then he would text my cell phone, telling me he needed me online (outside set work hours) to run a sake through. 

By the end of the second week, I continually checked my PayPal account to see if he had transferred my salary, which was the agreement when I began working on his project. However, my pay never came through, in fact no attempt to pay me was ever made. By the third week, I was getting angry and anxious about not getting paid as we had agreed. So, on the third week, I did NO work, but still gave him the opportunity to pay me the salary he owed me ($600.00 by that time), and I allowed him to change the terms of my pay and how I would get paid for the first few months. By my fifth week doing tasks for Merschen Cord, he was telling me a check was being sent to pay me the $900.00 he owed me, this check was supposed to be sent the Wednesday of my fourth work week, then on Monday of my fifth work week, then I was informed I would recieve a check on Wednesday and again on Friday of the same week (work week five). On Monday of the sixth week, I asked if the check had been mailed and again I received a response of ""not yet"".

I resigned from my position with Merschen Cord and informed him that I was closing any and all merchant accounts I had created for him, and I was shut the operating website down. I don't make idle threats, so I shut everything I had created for his business down. I also informed him of his outstanding debt of $900.00 for my time, which was for three weeks of salary due.

1395,"As I read about the so many complaints of people who had lost their earnings from using freelancer.com, I feel relieved and feel lucky because compared to most of them I didn't lose so much, just a significant amount of time and a few $. Anyways, I was hired by two employers; one suddenly cancelled after accepting the milestone and even had the guts to leave an obnoxious comment which I was charged $ for nothing, the other one I was able to finish the work but the employer didn't want to release my request for the milestone which prompted me to file a dispute and which of course I was charged $ for another project for nothing ( I actually used the site to make some cash not to lose some ). So my advice to the people who haven't experienced anything like this yet is ""to trust NO ONE"" even freelancer.com, as a freelancer you have no security and for as long as they get the $ project fee, all they can do is send you e-mails with NO CONCRETE solution to your problem...Well, for me I JUST CLOSED MY ACCOUNT AND WILL NEVER EVER THINK OF GOING BACK and go on with my life.

What's this new stupid Freelancer.com policy that is forcing users to put their own images (face) on their profile photos? No logos or other images allowed otherwise your bid amount will be lowered and after that the account closed / suspended.
Do you think that is normal to get my bids restricted while I have my ongoing paid premium subscription? Meaning you're lowering my bid amount (because I do not have my face photo on my profile) which I'm PAYING for every month!!!
And do not bother to respond that other images might be subject to copyright, this would be silly response.
Also, you well know Freelancer is running a kind of survey on the dashboard that you will be pointed to every time you log in. General questions like ""how you like freelancer"" or bla la bla - seem acceptable but this new question I see now on the screen ""WHAT'S YOUR SKYPE USERNAME?""

1406,"This Website lures you in by claiming everything is free, but one or two wrong clicks and violá - you just spent 10$ on some language test.

I actually complained about this and they were nice enough to refund the Money to my Freelancer account. Since withdrawal is only Possible with 40$ or more, I deposited another 30$. However they refused to pay out 40$ and instead paid only the 30$ while also just removing the remaining 10$ from my account. 

Like, I know it's ""just 10$"" but seriously now - where's my Money?

UPDATE Oct 3rd, 2013: Apparently, the wording in the automated e-mails I received was just a Little misleading. What they tried to tell me is that the 30$ were refunded to PayPal but the 10$ were refunded to my credit Card where they came from. This seems to be some technical Limitation.

Bottom line, I'd say this site is OK as Long as you're really careful about where you click.

That being said, other then paying the agreed cost of the project to the programmer, all back-end costs we the programmers responsibility.  In my opinion this improved the quality and reliability of the programmer since they had to bear that burden.

1408,"Good company but need attention to freelancers needs
Pros-
1. Easy to bid - platform is very simple for bid easy to understand
2. Good Messaging system - messaging system is good with video function
3. Lot of job opportunities - it has lots of jobs
4. Speed - site is reliable no downtime at all.
5. withdrawal processing is good and on time.

Cons- 
1. Customer support  skip our questions by telling various things and show terms and condition scape from questions,i opened 6 tickets for a  problem they didn't resolve that and they never solve problems of freelancers.

2. After payment received they can reverse the payment anytime even pass few years they reverse funds from freelancers.

3. Verification process is very complex for asian users

4. Huge number of fake users - they telling they have 16M users but only  100k or 200k are active and reliable freelancers

5. Not allow multi-pal withdrawals- multi pal withdrawals are blocked recently, if  2 or 3 people works on same profile they are worrying about this
6. new users can easily start their freelancer career

Suggetions
1. Freelancer.com treats good for their users before 1-2 years ago but now they limiting resources for users and not treats well (i don't know recently management was changed )

2. My main concern goes with verification process, specially Asian users its hard to follow KYC verification, reasonable numbers of freelancers stay with their parents and they don't have any bills or bank statement under their name,

some peoples living under a rented house they don't have a address to verify .

and the other problem they facing the documents address formats are not in Australian format so your verification team directly rejecting those.

so i think its better to send letter with verification code to users address then they can enter code and verify, lots of sites using this methods.

you can see hundreds of users comments
https://www.freelancer.com/community/articles/what-is-required-to-become-verified

 they really need to verify their account because they are not fake users and worked  for years. if they are fake they no need to comment like that they can simply create another profile and do their black operations, this users really need become verify and use their reputation to get projects rather than scape like fake users and create new accounts, your team need consider about their comments.

3. Its better to allow multi pal withdrawal again lots of freelancers doing projects by 2-3 groups, they can share their funds directly.

4. Better to improve tire 2 customer support. they are good for chat but not for solve problems.

Long story short, I was very pleased as to how fast the help was. However at one point I felt like the helper was getting frustrated at my comments (nieve customer not reading fine print) does not make me wrong, it makes me un-informed and some part of a companies job is to have their customers as informed as possible before they make a $600 commitment. 

We are all human I understand, but as a stressed out customer that is about to be $600 down for nothing, I think the helper can skip any efforts at trying to look authoritive and rude, because fact of the matter is, it did not help me as a customer view your company in a positive light.

1596,"Wonderful people at customer support: very bright, high level of understanding, always helpful, extremely fair, including with money the members pay or with the request for refunding - every time a small mistake was made, they immediately refund me the amount, even if it was less than 1$.

A very interesting site, which offers the opportunity to extend the career to the international, very interesting clients, a world full of challenges. Quite comfortable to work from home, it cannot be considered a steady income for a family but a nice extra income from time to time.

The site needs to improve the points related to the barriers it creates for freelancers:
1. For highly paid projects, they request to have at least 5 reviews from projects you made before, to be able to send an offer to the customer who published the advert. But what happens if you are not a writer who writes 5 articles and is paid 30$/article, but an architect or a consultant, who normally may work only on projects over 1000$? How can you access them if you are not allowed to bid until you reach the 5 reviews? 
The site should really reconsider its policy, especially that only the customer may appreciate the competence of the freelancer. Also, they should consider that if they apply this unfair policy, the only freelancers who are able to apply for these projects will be the under-competent ones, not the freelancers who really have the necessary competence. I have seen many complex projects requesting, for example, an external auditor or specialized business consultant, where the average technical experience needed was over 10 years in order to complete the project, and the only people who were able to apply due to the Freelancer limitations were .... writers! Obviously, the customers were not able to receive the necessary competence, they selected none, so both the site and the competent freelancers lost the money. Is this a helpful barrier for anyone, including the site? Obviously not!

2. If the customer does not pass through the procedure of identity verification, then even if he paid the project, it is not possible for the freelancer to receive the payment, as it is blocked by the site. Of course, the freelancer cannot verify if the customer passed through the procedure or not. I found myself in this situation, and when I talked to Freelancer customer support they required me to kindly ask the customer who paid to perform the operation. Why? It really was not my business to do this, the site should not permit customers to have a profile or publish a job unless they went through the procedure. This is the legal obligation of the site, not of the freelancer. Why it is involved the freelancer and why the payment from the site to the freelancer depends on it when the freelancer has nothing to do with the legal requests which apply to Freelancer related to verifying its paying customers?

3. There is a very limited space & no. of characters for an offer, it's almost impossible to make an offer to a business in 2 phrases.",4,"“Wonderful customer support, and a few points the site needs to improve” "
1597,"Freelancer is not so bad after all.  I still don't agree with their Bid Quality Score.  Giselle T. is one of their best customer service representatives.

So far i have enjoyed working in Freelancer.com. But, recently with regard to projects. So are creating fake projects and hiring us, as soon as i accept and asked about their requirement, they have no clue, mostly of them are new to Freelancer. This is bit annoying since i loose my money when accepting this kind of projects. 

Rather than this issue, overall it is a very good platform. I have so many very good clients, very nice and easy to work with. They always contact me for their designing work. I never accept jobs outside of Freelancer. Only through Freelancer. 

Some clients posts projects for one job and once we accept, they are asking for more work to do. when we refuse, they leave with leaving a bad review/feedback to us. I have only met one such client in my entire freelancer career. It looks ugly in my profile. Out of more than 90 completed projects and reviews all reviews are good except this one and only ugly review.

I think Freelancer needs some sort of system to identify these issues. 

However, Still i believe Freelancer is the one best platform to work with.

Many times after completing a project the employer takes the money back from the site, and the annoying part is sometimes the employer asks to return his funds because of a problem from the site itself, Also it's not fair that the employer can make a refund easily after he take what he came from. The reason why i'm saying that you don't respect our time because you always return that payment from our money and you don't even return the fee we paid for these projects.

It seems to have the most flexibility for both clients and freelancers, as well as the best range of available projects and freelancers. That said, as it continues to grow and expand, not all of the changes are always for the best. For that reason, some of the best freelancers have left the site (and may continue to do so), because sometimes regular work elsewhere (even if just for yourself, of your own site) is better than the hassles of freelance work, even on the best of platforms. In particular, finding good regular clients on the platform can be a struggle for many freelancers, and for employers, finding freelancers who actually hold the skill they say they do can also be difficult.

I would like for this platform to be more friendly towards all workers, not only top 10 who are placing bids and usually are companies, not individuals. More chances for all people despite their ranking. I wish that everybody can find his own place and have income. This way it is easy for the ones on the top, and a true struggle for beginners, even though they might be as competent for the work, if not more than the top freelancers.

1659,"GENERAL

On the whole, I find working through freelancer.com, both as freelancer and employer, works well for me.  As a freelance photographer, and occasional translator and copywriter, I make a modest secondary income that supports my mainstream work elsewhere, and I use the services of a number of other freelancers, mainly in the software and photographic post-production markets.

SUPPORT SERVICES / HELP DESK

But when there is a problem, I have found in recent months too many times that the response from the Support Desk has been slow, and because that desk uses people whose first language is not always English, those support staff often miss part of what I am asking and only respond to the part that person understands.

Although smaller, Peopleperhour answers every question correctly, and usually much quicker.  Although French, Starofservice goes out of its way to understand what I say; (it does help that I speak French).  Although Chinese, even Iworku does a better support job than Freelancer most of the time.

PROPOSALS AND BIDDING

Although it has other faults, one major benefit with Peopleperhour is that I can attach samples of work to my proposals there.  I can't do that on Freelancer.  I feel that needs to change, at least for higher level membership freelancers like myself.

FAKE AND DECEPTIVE PROFILES

It is a requirement of Freelancer that if you have a photo of a person as your avatar, then that avatar image must be of the profile owner.  That is in site T&Cs.  I have drawn Freelancer Support's attention to the fact that there are too many people using someone else's image as their avatar.  I use an image of me.  Everyone else should do the same.  I can supply you with a list of known offenders.  Please contact me to do so.

CRIMINAL ACTIVITY

These are just some of the criminal activities I see coming up on Freelancer every day.  By allowing such projects Freelancer is condoning such activity and it has got to stop:

- Removal of copyright markers;
- Undertaking degree thesis writing for a third party;
- Blatant adverts for sex-trafficking, particularly in the Middle East.

This is a tiny set of examples.  Freelancer has got to get its act together and check EVERY project being posted.

CONCLUSION

Freelancer is good, but it could be so much better.

But in general, that is a good site where you can find work and earn.",4,“good place to work” 
1667,"My experience so far is the complete opposite to most here. If in the future things change i will be back and let you all know.

The bad:

 I'll start by saying the only thing i dont like about freelancer.com which is that they charge you the 10% of a project at the moment you accept it ....and before getting paid anything by the client that hired you.

 About this, two things to mention:

-This system of  charging 10% upfront is not hidden, so it is your risk if you decide to trust the employer, and also your skills to provide a good service.

-one day my fear became true, and five days after  (and three days of work approx) accepting a ""big"" project of 500usd, the employer decided she wanted something else (because a missunderstanding about the scope of the project) without paying anything.
 Thing is, i was able to communicate with them and let them know that i just lost 50usd without earning anything, and they just went and reimbursed them to me as a bonus, which i used to pay for the plan and some fees for another projects. So that would be the opposite of a scam. 

The good 

Even if is true that there are lots of projects that are paying like...nothing, there are others that pay fairly, and depending the economy of your country, more than fairly. Freelancer.com is not your employer or your father or best friend, is just a platform with lots of employers and freelancers....and as happens in world and life itself, you will find bad, meh, good, very good and excellent people/opportunities.

 At the momment i have worked with more than 15 employers, and generally speaking they were polite, they paid fast, some of them gave me a tip ( and of course freelancer will take their 10% of that fee too :O ), they gave me good reviews and i to them.

 About the scam badge

So far, and in my experience, the site has nothing to do with a scam. What will always be is people trying to scam and/or take advantage of other people ..be it in freelancer, ebay, or wherever. And also there is people trying not to pay freelancer the fee of a project and make ""an arragement"" outside of freelancer and that is also a scam since they are not running the site for charity.

Bad clients

I had one so far which isnt the one i mentioned before since that was just an unfortunate thing. 
 The one i say is one that was ok with the work but decided to start to add things here and there all for the same price. When i told him that he should either consider to stop adding stuff or to start to add money, he played the role of the offended and didnt paid anything for a  work 100% done. I started a dispute which i won so i was paid.

I submitted my driving licence, bank statement that is stamped from the bank as they demanded. I also submitted my cell phone bill... but they always mention one line that its don't match with our verification procedure.. I don't know what the hell they want to match with their verification standard. Tell me what is your verification standard. I went bank several time and they told that we have provided you stamped document and we cannot do more help.. 
I submitted ticket in freelancer.com that please what is your verification standard. i got same reply. contact the suspension forum . How i can write whats in my mind where is not any  space to write in suspension forum.

hi, i started freelancing on freelancer.com  a few months ago. at 1st i thought there system works like any other freelancing website. where you charge monthly fees to bid and then they get a commission from the employer payments.

recently, i have been scammed twice on the website by fake projects from fake clients that urge me to accept their project as soon as possible once i accept. freelancer.com charges me %10 fees on each project. this happen to me in 3 projects from 2 clients and i just discovered it yesterday when i found my balance with them $-564 instead of $0.00 .

i contact them and they said that they charge the freelancers for getting them with the client even if the client did not go with the project, canceled it or closed it or render unresponsive to your messages.

3061,"The title is not an exaggeration. Freelancer is really, really bad. I came across a scammer, who decided that taking my finished work and just moving on without paying was a great idea. Here is the kicker: Freelancer sevice thought that too! I reported the scam, presented proof of him breaking several most important rules and opened several cases asking for help. Support was mildly annoyed, very dismissive and generally conveying the message of ""well, tough luck"". 

On top of that, I actually had to pay Freelancer AUD 5 for the privilege of working on the project (33% of my prospective payout for the job).

The only redeeming thing I came across was Lyndon's support. It was was professional, courteous and very efficient. Simply fantastic and in stark contrast with the rest of the staff. Top job!

As you look at the reviews, you might notice that there are very few scores other than 5 and 1. This, I believe, is because the 1s are for the service as a whole, while the 5s are clearly for the support agents who managed to solve some issues and asked for a review.

Update: After a month complaining, the project fee (AUD 5) was refunded to me by customer support. Not much in terms of monetary gain, of course, but definitely a sign of goodwill from Freelancer.",5,"“The website itself is terrible, this is a review for support agent who helped me.” "

I also want to give a short feedback regarding the corporate membership account below and it will be great if you can forward to the relevant team for review for changes in the plan.

""I think while applying for corporate account, creating a new account for the same is not a great idea, it creates lot of confusion and has some bugs like there will be two URLs and two usernames for each account i.e. corporate and personal and the major blunder is when someone want to get the corporate back to personal account, then freelancer.com will ask to end one of the two personal accounts which a user never wanted to have two accounts. So its like you are deliberately asking to get two accounts in the beginning of this program and then in the end, you are asking to shut down your oe of the two (grown up) accounts. This should not be so complicated. You should directly have options to make personal and corporate account option and if a user is not happy with either of the options, you should give the option to convert it into other way round. That is the simple and best idea which will also help freelancer.com to get more people interested in corporate account. I look forward to get a reply from your people regarding the same. Thanks.""",5,“Appreciation for Charlotte B. (CX Specialist - Live Chat)”

As half of the bids gets wasted on project just posted for marketing, lounching Apps and to increase someones website traffic. So i am requesting you to look into that..

Thank you",5,“Thank you Freelancer”

5823,"Actually, my freelancing career started through Freelancer only. I slowly built up and today I get many jobs here. 

I find a very unique thing at freelancer. The quest for improvement. Its like its DNA. You notice an area of improvement, and after a while you will that change being implemented on the site. Not once, not twice, many a times. 

corporate account, chat feature, call feature, multiple language site, payment options,well list is really long. so many things added.

The aggression, the pace reflects. 

Well, not everything is good. I encountered a few issues too. Comparing them with the benefits, they are not that important. Still.. 

And the one area perhaps needing focus is support. For standard issues, they are quick and easy to deal with. But the issues where decision making is required, they really are not good enough. 

For example- I was awarded a project. Money sent to milestone system by employer. I delivered the job and when i saw the milestone, the money was not there. I came to know that money was funded thru fraud/wrong credit card. and thus milestone sent back. well.. happens. but.. but you deducted project fee on that case. That was doubling my trouble. I worked for a full day for no money, and thereafter i paid fee. and i was not at any fault. In such cases, forget legal aspects, be true and concerned. If so happens in future, I see this place leaping forward only.

I think freelancer.com is creating ficticious projects easy enough for people to work on then credits your account and charge you a fee. They then claim the merchant was bad and take away your ""fake"" earnings while still charging you a fee.

If you just take a step back and look at the postings you can see that most are basic vague postings.( I grant there are legit projects) but most are really designed for you to ""win"" and charge you a fee.

They probably also play this game of taking your hard earned money be claiming bad vendor etc....

6016,This website is good with many various freelancer jobs for someone who do not want to hop onto job wagon too fast but instead venture into various career path or interests before realizing one;s direction of potential to venture fully into.,5,“Freelancing jobs” 
6017,"I have read several reviews about a scam and such, but I had never experienced any billing/payment issues until yesterday. However, after a quick chat with a support team representative, I was refunded immediately. Additionally, my experience on the site has been quick job-finding and quick payments and it is definitely one of the best freelance sites out there.",5,“Good and honest support.” 
6018,"Hi , i am one of the preferred freelancer on freelancer.com/u/thesmartvmp.html 
I been working with freelancer.com since an year and i would love to say that ,they are just Awesome, specially their Supports system are prompt , you do not have to email them , you can directly chat with them by log on to https://support.freelancer.com/index.php .

Lets talk about the Recruitment Staff {only applicable if you are Preferred freelancer }
if you are working nature ,quality of the works are really good and high ratings , you can apply for the preferred freelancer program , once your application has been approved , you will get the projects updates from freelancer.com executives/Representative.

i have had done several projects with Marcus,Alejendra , bryndis and Summer , these are among the highly motivated , Love able and skilled staff i ever seen ,Marcus who is one of the best and friendly guy too ,Yes they do laugh sometimes with a professional talk and what is amazing is . if you are able to finish the projects and able to satisfy the clients needs  ,you are always on the top race to get the huge amounts of the projects.

Generally you have to bid on 30 projects to get the job that worth somewhat 200 USD and its adorable ,so you can daily wake up to getta the work finished that worth 200 $ and you can do it in max 2 days of time.

Regarding the Disputes , i m lil bit negative through the site , most of time decision in the favor of the employer even you met the criteria but some time not , this is aviodable , they are few odds employers who come for free stuff and might be they are getting , but if you are strong and delivered the exact work ,you can win dispute too.

Nothing to comment on people who around here and filing the false reviews/negative reviews , i must say , you do not have the right skill set to get the job or may be you are not too smart :P lol .

Just kidding , trust me spend one month on freelancer.com and Analise the site , take a look at some bid , In the bid proposal you can ask you employer thing like ""i wanted to get started with your task right away , as a noob freelancer over here , getting work is too hard , so i can promise about the deliverable and does not need to have the milestone , pay only after successfully getting the files over here "" BAM !! , if you are too good at work , you will receive the money and good ratings too and YOU START.

Try to place the bid , when there is less numbers of Dedicated/highly rated freelancers are off line so you will have more chances to get the job .

6019,I got 2 Freelance Jobs in www.freelancerr.net with easy bid.,5,“Freelance Jobs Online” 
6020,"Freelancer.com is the best place on the internet to make real money, It provides you with tens of thousands of projects that needs to be done.
But freelancer is a risky place, you have to be aware of the scammers that will waste your time and money. but once you make the deal and take the money from the employer then you're safe. freelancer WILL send you the money.
The first payment is a little hard, and as some of you said, They will take every chance to delay your payment. But if you did everything right they will pay you on time and with no delay.
I got my first payment a couple of days ago and I'm waiting for my second payment now, I made about 1000 USD this month and work requests are still coming. I'm seriously thinking about quitting my job and start to be a full time freelancer.
The customer service is good too,They are nice and helpful.
The only disadvantage is that dealing with the site is really hard, you can be scammed (by other users) easily, your first payment can be delayed easily. But this site is about making money and it's doing its job perfectly.
Good job Freelancer.com",5,“Freelancer is NOT a scam” 
6021,"Alright, the people who are claiming freelancer.com to be a scam site obviously dont care about the terms and conditions of the job. The majority of the people ranting here are the people who have bid on money exchange project ""150 Eur here , 90 on Skrill"" those people are frauds. They steal credit cards and then they get the money and they chargeback. My advice is to stay away from such shady clients. best way to do business is to make sure that the employer understands what he is doing and you as well. Support staff sucks major balls though, cant deny that.",5,"“Dont indulge in shady business, users.” "

 However Payment system is still not Good they says that we need to wait for 15 days to receive our first payment, I'm waiting for my first payment but problem is that i withdrawal money on 28th April now i'm seeing a message tell that your money will be transfer on 
20th May, which always changes, i mean son 28th April date was 15th may to get money but now it's changing and now showing 20th May, which is not good, all other thinks are good and powerful.

6031,"Hey, I've been using Freelancer.com almost 3 years now, at first you really need to be patient and I know how painful it is to lose something valuable to you. Though negative for others, my experience with Freelancer.com is great, I won several web designing contest, and received my payment in full. Had recent web designing project worth over $500 with no problems at all. Being extra careful pays off. Maybe try these tips, they might help you:

1. First, before accepting a project, make sure the client has a verified payment method and created a milestone so that it will cover the fees that Freelancer.com charges, this will also protect you from being scammed as freelancer.com would be in the middle.

2. Investigate - Don't get too excited when someone finds and hires you (because I don't, I investigate first), don't click that ""ACCEPT"" button yet!!! Investigate first before accepting it. An example would be what mentioned in no.1.

3. Negotiate - Don't be shy, your profile speaks for you (tell the client about your feedbacks and previous projects), this will gain trust of the employer. Ask for milestone payment before accepting the project (explain freelancer.com fees), do a counter offer if you feel like you are doing a tough job and paid less.

4. Regarding contest, I make sure that the contest price is guaranteed. Meaning I get the assurance that I will get paid for it. I also observe the client's behavior when it comes to his judgments in the contest entries, when I see creative designs being rejected (e.g. poorly designed entries chosen instead of quality entries), that's when I back out.

Hope this helps you out. Cheers Freelancer.com!

At no point did I give them permission to do that, and they sent no email to tell me that they'd done it. My first clue was when the money was deducted from my paypal account.

Edit, they got back to me very quickly to offer to refund the charge. I cannot fault their service. The real test will now be whether the money actually makes it back to me.
My issue seems a lot smaller than that of the other reviews that I have read but is no less frustrating. This is a devious tactic which I was lucky to have noticed.

When asked the last time, only then they sent me an email saying I have exchanged my contact details and have completed the transactions outside the freelancer system, so this is not out of their authority. This is insane and gross careless statement. I have not done both, and they can verify this very easily by reading the chat between the employer and me, if they want (I had asked to do so too) My problem was how they could come to such wrong conclusions and be so stupid.

6035,"Hi
I was writing a review yesterday and power fluctuation happened and I could not submit.

Got my all money refund for monthly fee and suddenly membership without my prior notice or usage or applying.

Anyway I was so surprised to see my money was taken as a monthly account dormant fee ( are we using a bank to use bank balance? )
anyway I was not using freelancer since the day my account was shifted from www.rentacoder.com website with balance 89 usd
I reported them account sign up date as anyone could see on my profile.
If an account is signed up in 2010or something then how can you do a job in 2006 and onward? which is a big LOL

They did not fixed they told they have no option to change ( being e a developer and working as self employed ) I know and people there also know that you can change the date.

Anyway I posted the matter again few months back ( as I never knew my amount was being deducted suddenly ) I only got to know a day ago when an email received.
Note: In between time period I did not received any alert for payment deduction.
Point 4 I was checking their invoices and none of the invoice got opened, it was error error error on each invoice, it was around 5 invoice 

Point 5 I was also charged membership fees around 25USD a month which is more than weired, why a membership fee when free account ? more when not using it?
Anyway I had only 14.01 usd left hahahahaha

I reported them yesterday date 1 June 2014
and without any delays or getting  response my money was refunded completely.

I was there on website I was getting one by one amount and all the invoices were removed from my account, I have screenshot all this process of invoices and no invoices, amount one by one and also charged amount.

Anyway I have received the money back but they still did not fix my account date
I have the newsletter says
When you signed up on 11th Feb 2010 you were the 404,760th person to join us.
Rermember the first project? you started ""TellAFriend/Newsletter Subscribe Form"" back on 14th June 2008?

First mistake no one can join after the first project which is almost 2 and half year back LOL
And also my first project is wrong I never did that, first project was 
create 2 login buttons, and the date was May 7, 2006
so what to say? they still can not fix

But I am happy that they did refund my all amount around 75USD which is awesome.

I would like to upload screens but no idea how to as there is no option here to upload.

6036,"Well... I guess only unhappy users post reviews here, happy users have other stuff to do.

I agree freelancer.com does have some issues with payment system. That is - when an employer pays he must complete some verifications before funds become available. But funds show up on receiver account immediately - which I think is incorrect. If I see funds on my balance I must be able to use or withdraw them - as simple as that! If you need verifications then force payers to verify their accounts before they pay, not after! This is just ridiculous.

Other then that it's nice and easy to use system, way better then rentacoder/vworker in the past (I am saying that despite I was in rentacoder's top 50 top coder rating). And I am still giving it 5 stars. Freelancer.com is in no way a scam - they refunded my fees many times. Once I lost some $500 as a fee just because I forgot to upgrade to Premium account. They refunded me that money although they didn't have to. Thanks freelancer!",5,“Well...” 
6037,"Hello,
I am using Freelancer for almost a  year. I have positive experience as a freelancer. I work as illustrator and graphic designer. I just wanted to see what are experiences of other freelance illustrators and designers on Freelancer, so I just googled the ""experiences from Freelancer"". I must say I was surprised to see problems people have. Although, I do see what are they talking about. When I started working on Freelancer I've noticed there are ""suspicious"" projects posted- employers with short/odd briefs, or if they start communication-communications doesn't work. So from this two things- I make some conclusion about employer. Also, I demand from Employer to create the Milestone before I accept the bid-as it only becomes active when I accept the project. From the other side, I see there are freelancer who bid on the project in seconds after the project is posted (i am not sure how). 

Regarding employers, I have positive experience. Just a few were ""difficult to deal with"", but no one was fraudster. So I kept 5 star ratings and I am pretty happy. I've continued to work with about 30% clients outside Freelancer.  

I also work on Elance. The difference is there are less those ""scam"" projects. But I tend to ignore them. Also, as someone mentioned in his review, freelancers on Elance do read their brief- so there are no this ""quick"" bids.
