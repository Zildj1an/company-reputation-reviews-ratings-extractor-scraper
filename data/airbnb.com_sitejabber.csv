0,I tried calling customer support many times since my account was blocked by airbnb. The response is: you will recieve an email/call from us shortly. no call . no email. no account. terrible customer servies today - was on the phone with them for 15 min and they disconnected me. i can't use their services because they can't reactivate my account.,1,“horrible experience” 
1,"I rented a home for a weekend and a window was damaged. I contacted the company I rented from (a very popular on line rental company that people put thier privatley owned homes up for rental. I don't want be sued by naming them but the name of the company starts with an A and ends with a B and the name is 6 letters with A's b's and an i in the name)  because I have integrity and felt it dishonest not to do so. The property owner sent in an invoice for the wrong type window which was $1000 more than I owe for the actual window we broke. The owner acknowledge his mistake immediatly and agreed with me. I received an invoice for payment for the incorrect amount from Airbnb. When I contacted them regarding this I advised them they needed to contact the host to get corrected invoice. I then received a dismissive email from a customer service rep named JOAO. Joao wrote that after ""careful review"" I still owed the incorrect amount and that my future reservations had been cancelled and my account deactivated. I had rented 4 times in the last 6 months from them so I am not a new customer.I have been trying to reach them on the phone to no avail. Do not rent from A_ _ B N B. You can contact any host on the site with questions before you pay anything. Contact that host and ask to rent directly from them. Use A _ _ _ _ b in the same disgusting manner in which they treat thier good customers. I am so angry. I am also contacting the Better Business Bureau and will make it my mission to write reviews to help others to not get SCAMMED and DISMISSED by this disreputable company. Shame on you A_ _ _ _ b.",1,“Think very carefully before using this company” 
2,"Never will book again with Airbnb. The owner struggled for four hours to add a day to our reservation. It took Airbnb until 2:40 the next morning to acknowledge my attempt to book a townhome in Mammoth. I loaded three photos over three hours by instruction of the customer staff. The company cancelled my reservation three hours before it was to timeout. Had to keep writing the owner. Called customer service at 5:00 am because our reservation was still not confirmed. The automated system kept not accepting my photo to match with the government ID (California Driver's License, front and back) I submitted. After 1.5 hours in a chat with customer service. Leizel said she had to go to a meeting and would call me in an hour -- when my reservation had been cancelled! There were between 20 minutes and over I hour in gaps to the chat responding.

3,They will give you the run around when it comes to refunds! I have been trying to get my $486 refund which they claim to have processed in November 2018! I've yet to receive the money and when I call I cannot speak to the department handling my issue as they only respond to their online chat support. Really?!!,1,“Poor customer service” 
4,"Their famous service does not equal to their customer support. Definitely the worst I've encounter yet!! I was just asking them to delete my account since I have the right to have my personal information removed. Instead, what I received was rude agents and they only ""deactivate"" my account. No further help or respond was provided. Becareful and beware!!!",1,“Horrible!!!!” 
5,"Airbnb confirmed a reservation for my homestay. Airbnb send me a email to check in a customer. After customer check out, Airbnb does not want to pay me. The reason is Airbnb need to collect payment from customer before they pay me. They said customer have some payment issues. Airbnb said i need to wait until the cow comes home or until customer pays up. Many message to Airbnb has been closed by them. Beware of Monster Airbnb who does not care about Host. Sometimes also teaching customer to cheat Host.",1,“Airbnb does not pay Host” 
6,"Once I received the address after booking and searched the rental I found it 1,000 cheaper. If you try to cancel your reservation you only receive 25% refund. Do not use AirBNB, they are a scam company just search through other more reputable companies.",1,"“Outrageous pricing, use a different company.” "
7,Terrible experience. My wife made a reservation for a month in advance and canceled it two days later. They would not refund all of my money. My daughter used them on a separate trip and the rental was cockroach infested.,1,“Terrible” 
8,"We have several homes that we manage and unfortunately, a couple of years ago, some of our property owners had heard of Air B&B and insisted that we try them. We now have lost half of our properties because Air B&B doesn't pay us and hence we cannot pay the property owners or our cleaning crews. The president of our company has had to get personal loans to cover the amounts that are due to be paid out to the property owners. We are talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars. It has gotten to a point where every booking we receive through Air B&B has to be verified over the phone to make sure they have sent our money to the proper / working bank account. They are still holding a huge amount of money from 2 years ago.

      If you are considering trying Air B&B, I recommend that you reconsider. VRBO/HomeAway is not any better either. These companies have gotten so big that they now control most of the Internet bookings and apparently are not capable of keeping themselves organized. If you are lucky enough to talk to someone that can actually communicate with you, you can expect rude service and even hang ups. 

     One thing I DO recommend is that even though both Air B&B and VRBO/HomeAway will not divulge the e-mail addresses or phone numbers of the renters until they are actually booked, once they have booked one of your houses, encourage them to book directly through YOU the next time they want to rent one of your houses. I send our clients a friendly e-mail once they check out and tell them how much they could have saved if they would have booked directly through us.",1,“Don't use them EVER!!!!!” 
9,"I'm reading a lot of reviews here from renters but need to add my own as a property owner.  We own and/or manage 17 vacation rental properties in two countries and have been Air BnB hosts for over 10 years with 95% 5-star ratings.  Every now and then, we get a weird bad review-usually due to a gap between what we offer and the expectations of the guest.  Recently, we got a 4-star review from someone whose issues included no water in the ice cube tray, exposed television cables on the wall, no door on the closet and not understanding that Air BnB properties don't include breakfast (it was her first time using the platform).  As a result, Air BnB suspended the listing for a week because it fell below their arbitrary 5-star requirements, with no option for disputing the review and no one to talk to at customer service.  Their attitude is ""we let the reviews speak for themselves"", even when the review is clearly unreasonable.  I can live with a bad review-I can't accept the arbitrary suspension as ""punishment"".  10 years ago I used to tell everyone how great customer service was at AirBnB, and it was.  Something went wrong somewhere along the way and they have become arbitrary, unresponsive and arrogant.  There are better choices out there including VRBO/HomeAway and Trip Advisor/Flipkey  We've developed our own booking site and related marketing tools and last year, it came close to beating Air BnB in total booking revenue for our properties.  So we're winding down our participation on the Air BnB platform this year.  They don't seem to understand that property owners are their lifeblood and responsible for 100% of their income.  I would have written them to tell them of our decision directly but they don't seem to want or care about this feedback.",1,“This company has gone off the rails...Owners- skip AirBnB and use your other options” 
10,"One of the worst travel platforms to work with... they provide zero support for hosts despite years of loyal working relationship, they will turn on you with no real justification. Not worth the anxiety for a big Disappointment at the end. Their customer support also sucks they provide only useless textbook answers with no real solution at the end!!! They are an utter disappointment to work with whether a host or a traveler!",1,“Utter Disappointment!” 
11,I booked a home that when I arrived was in a seedy neighborhood with people drinking and hanging out on the corner. I didn't even enter the home. The owner did not answer and the people at Airbnb kept giving me excuses about a refund as I didn't feel safe. The house didn't even look like the picture posted. The bars on the windows of houses next door and the drug deals going on state not a good place to stay but the ad said nice neighborhood. Huh. Not sure if I will ever use this site again and this ruins it for the good hosts,1,“Horrible customer service”

13,"I work for a trade show company in Southern California and we make frequent trips out to Las Vegas for various trade shows. There was a house that I saw that was available by a host named Andreas (From Los Angeles) that I wanted to book for my boss, myself, and my employees. So while I have this reserved, there were some things I had to change about the profile since it was a company profile under a former employee's name. While doing so our reservation was canceled and we were only offered a partial refund. I contacted the host about refunding the rest and he offered me a bogus special that was for $199 per night. Well, the original price was for about $150 per night. He also told me that he contacted Airbnb and they informed him that it was an error that caused the cancellation. So he was of no help to me. I then proceeded to call Airbnb in which the first operator that I spoke to hung up in my face. Then the second individual tried to put the blame on me before it was handled by her manager who is named Diana. Diana contacted Andreas about offering a refund and he refused. Then she turned around and told me that it was me that canceled, and a full refund would not be provided. So Andreas gets a free $500 on top of the new guest who reserved his house. Good job with supporting scammers Airbnb. I will be reporting you to the Better Business Bureau.",1,“Ripped off” 
14,"Recently booked a stay at a Bronxville, NY house...wound up in the owners basement apartment which was dirty and not what was advertised.  Airbnb said they got me back $150 of the $500 I spent even though I got scammed and had the documents to prove it. It was a clear case of bait & switch. They did nothing and the scammer is still listing the rental. I would never use them again. Their customer service stiinks.",1,“Airbnb Customer Service” 
15,"I made a reservation for a rental home for 2 months in Albuquerque, NM.  As time went on something unexpected came up that interfered with out keeping that reservation.  I called Airbnb months ago to cancel.  They told me It was cancelled.  Yesterday I found out IT WAS NOT!!!! Out the Money.",1,“No way to get out of a reservation.” 
16,"We will never use this dishonest, greedy, immoral company again. Airbnb rented us an illicit rental apartment in an Atlanta apartment complex. As we found out once we were there, the complex does not allow Airbnb rentals.  The host gave us and dozens of other Airbnb renters the security code to the front gate of the private complex and access to all the complex facilities.  We were kicked out of the apartment. I notified Airbnb that the host is not allowed to rent out her apartment in this complex and that I want a refund. Airbnb refused to refund ANY of our payment. I gave the the number for the main office in the complex.  Not only did Airbnb not bother calling the complex, they continued allowing the host to rent the apartment, knowing full-well that the rental is illicit. 
Their customer service is worse than the DMV.  The worst I've ever dealt with. It took me hours to reach a person who could speak English and understand the problem.  But they didn't care. They said it's not their problem or their responsibility to make sure the Airbnb rental property is legitimate and legal!",1,"“Airbnb is a dishonest, greedy, immoral company” "
17,"We will never use Airbnb again.  Airbnb pretty much the worst company I have ever seen.  The worst customer service experienced anywhere.  

They have so many issues with their business!  Things almost always go wrong when you use Airbnb, and they provide the worst customer service.  An Indian 'follow the script' 'I can't do anything for you' --- customer service person is all you got.  And they have no employee ID, no name that you can hold them responsible for, and they obviously don't care about the company's reputation or care to provide good customer service.  Care even less trying to understand your situation, and help you solve any problems.  So as a host, or renter, you have issue, you can expect to left to pay for it. 

As a business owner myself, I really don't like to see other business go bad.  
But Airbnb is one of the only company I wish will go out of business, and someone else come into the space with a better run company.",1,"“Worst company, worst customer service, they just don't care” "

This caused us multiple  problems.

B&B would only refund a partial amount, which did not still well.  We should not have to pay ANYTING!  Finally, AmEx refunded the full amount.

Also, at 8pm , in a strange city, we had to find a hotel... which turned out to be another

DONT USE AIRBNB
The property was not even close to as described. We were welcomed by another ""guest"" living in the house while drinking and sitting on our bed. Check in process was not as described and we had dirty linens. We didnt stay 20minutes and decided to cancel the reservation and the host was kind enough to agree to refund us but unfortunately Airbnb decided to take it upon theirselves to refund only 80dollars from the 600+ they owed us. We continuiously try to call their customer service, which IS THE WORSE, and unfortunately ever day they keep changing our case manager and no one follows up!! For the sake of your sanity and money, DO NOT USE AIRBNB. Pay the extra to stay in a hotel and be guaranteed a better service. Unfortunately Airbnb never follows up with the hosts to verify the apartment, condos and houses are as described in their posts!",1,“DONT USE AIRBNB” 
20,"BUYER BEWARE!!!!! Airbnb is GREAT... until it's NOT. I was an avid Airbnb patron for many years - hosting and staying. But then I had my first problem... an owner who lied about their place and was unresponsive once I arrived. I had paid $780 for a monthly rental - I stayed overnight with no internet, stove and a malfunctioning heater (it was freezing in Malta). The owner refused to give a refund so the great Airbnb staff got involved and got me a whopping $500 refund! So I paid $250 for a fraudulent one night stay! HORRIBLE! Will never ever use them again - because when will that next problem occur???",1,“Don't Gamble on AirBNB - It's Not Worth the Risk!” 
21,"I've been hosting using AirBNB the last couple months and find the app and company policies to be quite unfair for us hosts.   For example, anytime someone has an inquiry/question you as a host must pre-approve them staying with you in order to avoid penalties.  I have had several guests ask to park at my place for up to 3 weeks while they travel & only book 1 night at my place.   Because I don't have parking available beyond the nights a guest stays at my place, I don't pre-approve' these types of questions, however I always respond in a timely manner.  Because I don't automatically pre-approve these requests, I get punished by my approval percentage' rate dropping and therefore my listing is dropped to the bottom part of all searches in my area, even though my price & location may be more suitable for guests.  I also couldn't approve someone who wanted to check-in at 7am because I had a guest in the room & checkout is at noon for my place.   Because I didn't approve the person who wanted to check-in at 7am I again got penalized for not approving the 7am check-in.  Their customer service is also not good, lengthy wait times to speak with someone and untimely responses to online questions. It's truly an unfair system for hosts & I will no longer be using AirBNB.",1,“Brutal”

23,"My tale begins with a failed attempt to rent a cabin in Eureka Springs through Airbnb. In the middle of going through a divorce my wife filed false harassment charges against me without my knowledge and Airbnb cancelled my reservation and refunded my money due to the charges against me. ""Ok"" I thought ""understandable"" as I figured they didn't look specifically into my legal case to find the falsities. Well the deactivated my account. Enough time has passed, my case was dismissed due to the judge seeing through my wife's lies and I thinking I'm going to try using Airbnb for another stay in eureka and my upcoming trip to Lake Tahoe. WRONG. Even though I started a new account it was immediately flagged and deactivated. Customer service was NO help at ""Zoey"" spent no time looking into the matter and immediately responded with saying they had no obligation to offer explanation and had barred me from any further use of their platform. Ok. I get on Homeaway's site and I booked both my trips with confirmation in less than 15 minutes. Congratulations Airbnb. You lost a customer and added a nice blemish to your already poor reputation. HOMEAWAY for ALL your vacation rental needs! Lol",1,“This service is horrible and there are better options” 
24,"If you are looking for renting a property through this booking site please read carefully and be aware. 

Hidden fees 
The prices listed seem to be lower compared to some hotels, but that is misleading. Once you get to the check out you all of sudden notice that
1. They charge you booking fee for every day you book - that seems to be % of your booking so it can add up to $80-$100 extra 
2. Many hosts will charge you cleaning fee $30-$35
3. Many hosts will want you to also pay for electricity and water
4. Add to that that you get no daily service
5. No free breakfast 
6. No airport shuttle 
7. no 24 hrs front desk service since the host lives usually quite far or in different country

  All added up you pay a lot me for the booking than in the hotel

Process of booking through airbnb
This is the worst part. Their computer system is completely corrupted. It has so many glitches that both the customers and hosts have their share of adrenaline floating. For one, you have to wait for the host to approve you. You can send a request for booking with conformation after making your payement, but 24 hrs later you may get automated message that your reservation was cancelled because you did not verify your account. You go again and repeat the process with the verification only to receive another cancellation next day stating you did not upload your picture. 
  The host can send you a direct booking link, but if you don't respond in 24 hrs , not  48 as the system tells you, you get a message that the host withdrew your booking and the property is no longer available. If you contact the host he/she will tell you they never sent such a message and that they got message that you cancelled the reservation. So it is absolutely ridiculous.

Making changes/cancellations
Most places allow you to make changes with 48hrs. So you go in change your dates and send a message to the host requesting the change. However be aware that the system will not log in your change of date. It will only send the message. If your host does not respond in next 24 hrs, the airbnb rep will tell you that you passed your 48hr cancellation window and you are loosing your deposit. 

  Take my advise and book through more reputable sites such as hotels.com, booking.com, agoda, or what ever else, but stay away from this site to save yourself the headache. I am sharing this with you as an expensive lesson I have learned. Do not make the same mistake I made.",1,“Corrupted system & hidden fees” 
25,"We used Airbnb for years without issues in various countries of the Western world and Vancouver. But now that we're back in Quebec, we are treated to our own people's complete disregard for basic courtesy, it seems. The first place we rented was dirty and smelly. In addition, we were imposed a flatmate for a couple of nights when we had rented the whole apartment for a month! Thankfully, this was a clear breach of contract and we were refunded, otherwise we would have had to endure the stench and dirt. Then we rented an awesome and spotless house twice. The third time, though, the host canceled on us with a three-day notice! We couldn't believe it. And now we just rented what would have been a great house for the Christmas holiday, except it was a smoker's house! There were lots of ashtrays and the air was toxic because the fireplace was on and the ventilation system didn't work properly. With babies, we had to leave. In addition, the place was dirty and we were absolutely grossed out by the inside of the microwave and the kitchen, in particular. When we wrote to the host just mentioning the cigarette smell, he merely insulted us in capital letters and ordered us to get out of his house immediately without a refund! We checked the reviews again, they're all very positive. Either people have seriously low standards, or Airbnb, as other commenters here have suggested, edits reviews and systematically deletes negative ones. Now our holiday is ruined. My husband spent 6 hours on the phone with representatives trying to get a resolution, thus ruining his family reunion dinner. There was also an issue with his account being blocked and him being unable to read correspondence. We are still waiting to see what will happen to the rest of our holiday. Thankfully we have relatives around who could host the 7 of us in the meantime. 
So people, here is my advice: don't rent in the province of Quebec! 

En français pour mes confrères francophones : nous n'avons eu que de bonnes expériences à l'étranger et dans le reste du Canada. Malheureusement, les hôtes Québécois ne savent pas s'occuper de ce genre de ""business"" (et je dis ça en tant que Québécois ) : nous en sommes à la deuxième maison crottée (dont une maison de fumeur avec un foyer à la ventilation défectueuse qui a rendu l'air encore plus nocif !! En plus, c'était le proprio qui avait parti le feu en nous disant de ne pas utiliser le ventilateur !), à un coloc imposé alors qu'on avait loué un appartement entier, et à une annulation avec 3 jours d'avis. Nous avons dû quitter les lieux à chaque fois et passer des heures à tenter d'obtenir un remboursement auprès de divers agents. 
Louez des chalets auprès de professionnels de l'hôtellerie, les standards sont trop bas au Québec. Nous sommes vraiment déçus de devoir le reconnaître.",1,“Never again!” 
26,"The experience overall was good as a host, But i do have an issue with not being informed/alerted that i had to provide an identity to withdraw the money! It's basically hidden info on the site while it should be very clear to me before i proceed to have a guest in my house, It's been a few months and the guest is gone and i still can't receive my money(That i started the whole thing because i was in need of it at that time), I can't do that because i don't own a passport and that's the only option they gave me to prove my identity so they made it even harder for me!

When ""working"" for over four hours with the Airbnb Customer Service, all of whom are shocked that the limited comps are so expensive so close to a major holiday.

We have video footage, took screenshots of these and we filed a claim with airbnb. Airbnb denied all claims saying that all these video footage is not enough evidence that the guests had extra guests!! Our listing clearly states that no extra guests are allowed, they will be charged fees for these and Airbnb just denied it! If that wasn't proof there were extra guests, I don't know what proof they think is valid!! Aibnb contact me about this icpm3245@gmail.com",1,“worst experience”

The coffee pot had dried coffee stains on it and the toaster was full of crumbs. We were so disgusted we canceled our booking, left after 20 minutes, and went to a more expensive hotel. Unfortunately, we didn't think about taking any photos. The host refused to refund us ANY money. Contacted Airbnb and was told any documentation needs to sent within 24 hours - HELLO??? We're travelling!!! How is that practical?

I posted a negative review of the cabin on Airbnb and was notified it wouldn't be posted until the host reviewed it and commented on it. How is that honest? All a host has to do is not review or comment on any negative review to avoid having it posted. My advice to anyone looking at Airbnb is to RUN! We will NEVER use Airbnb again.",1,“No Refund for Dirty Cabin” 
31,"I've used Airbnb many times and never once had a problem until now. BE AWARE of anything in the Host descriptions stating that ""additional information may be required"" means that Airbnb has allowed this Host to ask for private information to check for a criminal background, sex offenders and other private information that Airbnb has allowed the Host to profile, discriminate and DENY your stay in that Host property. Airbnb will not support the customer (renter) and refuses to refund the complete amount of money because apparently it is the customers (renter) responsibility to inquire what this ""additional information"" is before making a reservation. Airbnb is making a huge profit on our (the public) renting properties through them and do not stand behind us. Not sure how this makes you feel but to me this is completely wrong and should be illegal. I never once have had this happen in a hotel, resort, casino. No where in the US is this alright but for some reason Airbnb has allowed these policies to be ok for the Host to discriminate it's people. With all the equal rights we have in this country, a huge company like Airbnb is allowing a Host to discriminate. PLEASE BE AWARE of this. I have tons of correspondence between me and Airbnb, the Host managers company for proof. Like I said I have used Airbnb many, many times in the last 4 years and never ran into this until now. I'm sure they will reply with something on the lines of. Oh we are so sorry and it is the responsibility of us (the renters) to ask what ""additional information"" is before reserving a room and basically that it's not Airbnb responsibility to make sure that its users (renter) are protected and safe. I hope that someone out there reads this and has the money and time to slap them with a law suit. Discrimination and profiling of the public is not ok.",1,“Be AWARE” 
32,"I posted a recent complaint about Airbnb on their facebook page, not only did they remove it. They sent me a personal message acting like they had good intentions, only to lead me to a dead end like all of their other representatives. My bank will reimburse the funds I recently wasted on an airbnb trip, but my advice to future airbnb users, please read their terms and conditions. If there are any issues with the property you're staying at, document it in videos and photos, because airbnb will not reimburse you in anyway. Their customer service is completely despicable, don't waste your time with them. Contact a lawyer and seek advice before proceeding.",1,“Airbnb” 
33,"Avoid Airbnb at ALL costs!! 
As a travel agency we have heard nothing but negative experiences from this place over the past 2 years which have just gotten even worse. 

Absolutely unprofessional company first of all. Had to contact them re issues on numerous occasions and if it didn't take weeks to hear (a poor) response I never got a reply at all.

Secondly, if a company (Airbnb) has to PAY people and agencies to leave positive reviews on their behalf, it says very little for the reputation of that company (Airbnb).

Lastly, there has always been a safety and trust issue with these listings on their site. Majority of them have turned out to be scams and hence why so many people end up with cancelled reservations. As recent as last week a female traveller staying at an Airbnb in Costa Rica was unfortunately killed at the same apartment. 

If you're going to travel and the quality / safety of your family depends on it; book with one of the more reputable sites... VRBO/ HomeAway. 

Update: 
We've also had numerous complaints with regard to racism on this site as some members a) either choose not to reply to some individuals based on their ethnicity or religious background. 
Their GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) are also not valid as two clients have their personal information being withheld due to Airbnb refusing them access to the site to properly delete and close their account.

34,Worst experience with host Michael.  Location was dirty and disorganized.  Host was not willing to clean as requested.  Location was unlivable and had to leave but they still charged for full reservation. No refund Was given when we requested since we did not stay.

I contacted Airbnb and they told me they were false reviews and I had nothing to worry about. They assured me that if I saw any when I checked in that they would move us. 
We checked in and we started seeing them everywhere!!! I contacted them and no only did they not move us but they only refunded $120 of the $950 we paid!

I have used Airbnb for years and I cannot believe how they treated this situation.",1,“Cockroach infested place and they wouldn't move us!” 
36,"The place I rented did not have the amenities it promised (heated pool) and was dirty.  Also the host showed up in our backyard in the dark with a flashlight unannounced during our stay and it made us feel extremely unsafe.  So, there is the component of having a host that is dodgy.  But the component that compelled me to write this review is the way airbnb handled my concern.  They sided with the host based on his rating overall rather than my individual experience.  My experience was uniquely bad but because his reviews were ok from other guests my concern were not addressed and was minimized.  There is not direct number to contact airbnb and so all complaints are logged in an e-mail process.  They called me back and that's when I got their number.  By the way, it's 855-424-7262 if anyone is looking to call them directly.",1,"“Stay away, zero stars would be more accurate” "

It means that guests who make exaggerated complaints, unreasonable complaints, or even outright false complaints are unquestioningly handed refunds with no recourse or appeal.  Doesn't matter if you can document the false or exaggerated nature of the complaint, AirBnB doesn't care about owners.  Savvy travelers know this and take advantage of it.  Owners are better off putting their time and energy into advertising elsewhere.",1,“AirBnB is bad bad bad for owners”

39,"We decided to book an Airbnb property as part of my partner's 40th birthday trip to New York.  I spent many hours researching available properties and chose what I thought was a clean modern apartment in Jersey City.  I looked at the rating for the host and his property, of which he had scored 4.5 out of 5 and numerous good reviews, so felt comfortable making a booking.  Unfortunately, had I paid closer attention, I would have noticed the handful of negative reviews that would have sounded alarm bells.

We arrived at the property at approximately 15:30, and we were disturbed and extremely disappointed by what we were greeted with.  Yes, the Airbnb photos were of the property, but they were VERY old. 
 The outside of the property was unwelcoming and off-putting, with overgrown weeds and litter strewn on the driveway.  Security was a concern, as the front door was only secured via a single deadbolt, due to the whole mechanism for the door handle being totally removed.  Entering the property, we were immediately struck by how tired, dark, and filthy the property was.  It seemed like the property hadn't been properly cleaned or repaired in years: lights that didn't work or missing; dirty grubby walls and doors; ceiling fans caked in dust and dirt; a bathroom that hadn't been cleaned since the last occupant, complete with an unflushed toilet featuring a toilet seat caked in what looked like mould/urine; the heating was turned off and could only be controlled by the owner - which he refused to turn this on despite calls and messages;  the bedding was dirty and beyond worn, and was only good for throwing out;  the ironing board was covered in stains.  I could go on, the flat was just DIRTY and a dive.  Obviously, we refused to stay here and contacted Airbnb immediately.  

We expressed to Airbnb the urgency of getting this matter resolved before night fall, as we didn't want to be roaming unknown neighbourhoods in the dark for another Airbnb property we knew nothing about.  Our requests were ignored and 5 Airbnb agents and 10 hours later, we were advised to book into a hotel for the night which they would pay for.  When I enquired into the refunding of my booking, I was told that I would only be receiving HALF of it, as I had made the mistake of contacting Airbnb first and not the host - I was furious.  It was now 12:30am, and after a stressful night with an unsatisfactory result we booked into a hotel.

The following morning we received an email stating that our original booking had been cancelled and that we would be receiving a partial refund.  Still, a replacement Airbnb booking had not been arranged, and we were left with nowhere to go.  We spent another day being passed around from agent to agent with no resolution in sight.  Once again, we were left with no other choice and booked into the same hotel for the remainder of our stay that evening.  Luckily we were eventually passed through to an understanding agent who went above and beyond to get us a satisfactory result (had we received this service from the beginning, I'd still be an Airbnb advocate to this day, but the damage had been done and it was too late).  I took us a week, but we eventually received a full refund, and one nights hotel booking paid for.

Booking with Airbnb resulted in us losing two days of our holiday (waiting for correspondence from both host and Airbnb), being pushed beyond breaking point trying to resolve the matter, and leaving me short of £497 (a combination of hotel fees, phone call costs, and transport).

They also stopped splitting co-host fees and will only payout to one person. As a person who cleans for hosts this is particularly frustrating.  I'm frustrated and the hosts i clean for are frustrated.  They have had a ton of complaints about this and it's clear they plan to do nothing.

1 Carpet was filthy and stained
2 Cook top was absolutely filthy and not properly cleaned
3. Griller door was broken and full of grease
4. Counter tops in kitchen were stained
5. Walls were filthy, chipped and i=unclean
6. Shower was absolutely filthy. Grouting had not been cleaned for months and was filthy.

I sent all photos to the hosts ""support team"" who said they could do nothing without permission from the host. I advised that i would not be staying in filth and would vacate the following morning as by this time it was night time.

At that stage I submitted a claim to airbnb attaching photos.

Airbnb's attitude was ..., ""oh well thats just wear and tear... no refund .
On calling and re emailing airbnb their attitude was one of not caring whatsoever.

Ive rented through airbnb previously , probably 10 times and Id say Ive been happy 6 times out of 10. This latest saga , for me, will mean I will never ever rent through airbnb again.

I have taken to Social media in every sphere I can to warn people of airbnb's attitude if you need to submit a claim.

They advise that they cannot simply just issue a refund. 

I wonder why they are there then if not to maintain a quality standard.

Two of us arrived late and took the two basement bedrooms.  The next morning the rest of us learned that the downstairs rooms had not been cleaned, there were no sheets in one room and only a single sheet in the other.

He said no problem, just call when we got there and he would provide us a code to get in the door. when we arrived in Jersey City at midnight, I called Jason (the host) and got no answer. The neighborhood seems very sketchy. I had to call 5 or 6 times before he answered and gave us a code. 

We got into the place and it was about 95 degrees maybe more. There was no A/c in the apartment as described in the ad. There was 2 towels for 2 guys who were staying for 4 nights. There were no bowls, no plates and all these were mentioned in the amenities along with a coffee pot which did not exist.

We called the host, complained he did honor a $100 refund. Later that morning, we had to sit outside because the unit was so damn hot we could not take it. When we came back in to go to sleep, there were cockroaches and silverfish on the walls. This was it for us! We packed up and left and did not go back. We complained to AirBnB and they claim the $100 was a fair settlement and we should not receive any additional funds.

Gift card madness. SO MANY limitations restrictions and rules on use of their own gift cards and credit that it really spoils life...leads to problems.

-----------

Airbnb screwed things up with the host resulting in...all of us losing about a day of a once-in-a-lifetime vacation.

Host thought we left a week early. They removed everything and threw away all our groceries. We are two families, groceries were purchased in bulk and repurchasing was a mess (as we couldn't now use bulk).

Airbnb agreed to cover some if the cost of groceries and stopped there.

----
Airbnb policies prevent split payment, prevent using gift cards in a lot of ways making life difficult. In fairness the Airbnb representative when out their way to help us use gift cards, yet there ended up being a miscommunication and the host thought we over extended our stay. 

In addition to returning home to an empty place, no food for dinner, no change of clothes for a shower, all the drama with the host to get everything back late at night, scrapping the itiniary for the following day, spending the time (and gas which is expensive here in Hawaii,) and all the hours to get this resolved - Airbnb has only offered partial cost of the groceries. They refused any additional compensation.

This left a rather bitter taste with our entire group.",1,“Airbnb screwed up with host messing us up...” 
56,"So Booked a property few days ago. While taking go the owner we realise that what I paid was different to what she received significantly. Decided to call airbnb to understand a little bit more and spoke to 3 staff in the US who hung up during the call. Called again to finally speak to a supervisor who was able to help answer the question around the discrepancy between my payment and what the owner received.

So the owner gets charged 3 % of fees. On top of this me as a guest got charged 17%!  Tried to understand a bit more about how the 17% is calculated but at airbnb guest fees are at their discretion. Could be anywhere between 0 and 20%.

I dont know why people book thru air bnb but for me never again. Totally absurd for a company to charge 20% in fees when all they do is list and book properties. Totally unjustified and absolute rip off. Please calculate ur fees before booking and compare with other websites.. for 20% you could afford a much nicer property somewhere or at least get to deal with a company who has manners.",1,“Exhorbitant fees and staff who hang up on you 3 times!”

We are a family husband and wife and infant. Since Caroline was rude to both me and my wife in addition to the last night guest (who actually cancelled her stay and left) we asked Caroline to leave. She refused and went to work. I texted her at noon asking her to leave when she comes back and that we will refund her the entire day. When she came back at 11:00 pm I asked her again. She yelled at us and refused again. We had no choice but to call the police. The police arrived and escorted her out. Such a terrible experience. However, it didn't end here. Caroline falsely reported that there is a camera or a recorder in her room. Airbnb shut down our account and believed her without investigation or even thinking logically about it. If there is camera or recorder why did she stay at all or even want to continue to stay. If I see a recording device in my room what is the first thing I will do? I will certainly take a picture for this device and share it with Airbnb or at least I will not stay for a minute. Airbnb trust and safety don't think. They contacted us and we told them the story and even sent a video for the entire room and asked them to contact ""Molly"" to get more information.

59,"My husband and I stayed at an AirBnB, where, on our very first day within hours of our arrival, the downstairs neighbor shoved a passive aggressive threatening letter under the door stating that the hosts have not fixed the insulation in the apartment, as a result of which the neighbors downstairs hear all of our footsteps in the lounge, kitchen, and bedroom areas. In fact, the letter itself says the neighbors downstairs have made it a habit to serve every single AirBnB guest of this host with the letter, so that the hosts will do something about it! At around 9 PM on our first day, when I was walking to the kitchen to get a glass of water the neighbor downstairs started shouting at us through the floors to stop walking and hurling insults. As a consequence, we had to tiptoe through the whole apartment through the most of our stay. To tell you the truth, we felt so unsafe that we were ready to call 999 during our stay if the yelling neighbor ever decided to knock on our door. It was THAT bad!!! We did contact the host as soon as possible on the very first day of our stay stating in detail how the neighbor verbally harassed us and how we have to tiptoe around the apartment now so that he doesn't start yelling at us again. The host said he would take care of the situation but nothing was done at all. Neither the host nor AirBnB took any steps to protect us from harassment. In fact, both the hosts and AirBnB's negligence allowed this verbal harassment to occur in the first place. Because despite previous reviews mentioning the insulation issue with the neighbor and the neighbor's behavior AirBnB allowed this host to continue to rent this place out to unsuspecting guests like us. When we contacted AirBnB about this they stated that they can only give us a $200 coupon for the verbal harassment and bullying we suffered at one of their properties! I'm sorry but a $200 coupon is unacceptable and frankly offensive! My and well as my husband's personal safety and well-being is worth more than a $200 coupon to me. And I don't think it is asking for too much to expect AirBnB to value their customers' personal safety and wellbeing more than a $200 coupon especially when their own negligence in supervising the hosts' property allowed this harassment incident to occur! I'm writing this review because I want to highlight AirBnB's negligence in allowing this verbal harassment to occur despite previous reviews mentioning the insulation issue with the neighbor and the fact that AirBnB, as a company, puts a $200 value on their customers' personal safety and wellbeing to warn future customers.",1,“AirBnB put a $200 coupon value on my personal safety and well-being!” 
60,"Booked a reservation for 3 nights at a Vancouver ""3bdrm Luxury Chic Downtown Apartment"" for my family of 5.  Cost per night was US$550.  Upon arrival the first night, there were homeless near the front entrance to the place and many drunken partiers roaming the surrounding area.  Terrible location for a family to spend their summer vacation.  Parking, which was located in the back of the building in a poorly lit alleyway, felt quite unsafe.  Once inside, we found the unit to be very mediocre, far below the ""luxury"" apartment that it was promoted as.  The unit was located on the top floor and very hot despite the moderate climate in Vancouver.  Small fans and a portable AC unit in one of the rooms did not do much to cool things down.  Windows were opened to cool the place down but the street noise was awful.  Some of it was normal big city stuff (sirens, cars, etc) but that night, we heard fighting outside and one girl screaming for someone to call 911.  We barely slept that night.  Actually, I spent the early morning hours reporting our experience to Airbnb.  
Later that morning, the host contacted me and I described our experience and expressed our desire to checkout and be refunded for the balance of the remaining 2 nights.  He would only agree to refund us if he could re-rent the place on short notice.  Otherwise, we would be responsible for the full cost of 3 nights.  We did not want to take that risk and agreed to stay.  The host said he would contact us at the end our stay and do his best to make things right.  This made me feel comfortable.
At the end of our stay, the host did contact me.  Since the remaining 2 nights were more tolerable, I requested a refund for the first night ($550).  The host only wanted to pay half ($275) and we eventually agreed that he would refund $400.  The host then stated that the refund would be conditional on me giving a 5-star review.  I was very uncomfortable with this and offered to leave no review but the host insisted that a 5-star review would be required for a refund.  Those were the terms.  I struggled with this for 1 week before finally succumbing to his requirement.  I did the 5-star review and requested the refund through the AirBNB website.  It was denied by the host.
I then contacted AirBNB customer service.  After contacting the host, they stated that the host denies any such agreement for a refund.  They felt bad that they could not resolve this to my satisfaction and refunded $70 back to me as consolation.
This was not acceptable to me, and I have made repeated attempts to get further assistance from AirBNB.  So far after a week, AirBNB has ignored my emails.  Several calls to AirBNB have gone thru and the agent on the line promised a quick response from the case manager but still nothing.  Seems to me that they will continue to stall until I finally give up.
As a final proposal, I informed Airbnb that I would forego any additional refunds on the condition that I can retract my original (extorted) 5-star review and replace it with an honest one.  After no response for several days, it looks like they will not even offer this basic courtesy.  Bad reviews are bad for business  and it's all about the money.

If you are planning to stay with Fernanda & Family via AirBnB, please read this till the end.
AirBnB was initially very supportive and processed my full refund BUT denied me the privilege of sharing my full story because I had initially mentioned the company who was managing the key collection. They did not ask that I remove the name of the company, but they removed my entire review as below!
Your rights to share your experience on AirBnB is very limited. Know your rights and be careful.
____________________________________________________________________________
We felt cheated staying with Fernanda and Family. The whole set-up seems like a scam. 
Key collection area was unwelcoming - there was a notice to say that it was under construction. A man came up from the basement. No hello, no explanation and zero hospitality and handed a set of key to us. At this point, it all felt like a scam; and we were worried.
Apartment Entrance: As we entered the building, there were trucks with graffiti parked on the roads. Didn't give a welcoming feel for a place that is described as Modern 5-Star Apartment. It also claimed to be family-friendly.
There was a homeless man sleeping at the entrance to the building; blocking our path to use the ramp (we have a baby stroller)
Foot steps and dirt all across the common areas and entrance. This was our first impression of the place. Which we paid Premium price for AED805 per night (167 pounds)
Alcohol cans and rubbish at the entrance. Shelter to homeless (sleep during the days, take drugs and drink alcohol during the nights)
The Apartment: Although it was serviced, it was not clean (as a 5-Star Modern Apartment). We were also charged AED200 for cleaning fee (42 pounds). This was what we found as we walked in:
Pubic hair in the bathroom
Hair in the corners of the whole apartment
Mould on curtains and edges
Salt built up in the kettle - not washable even after I tried. I needed a kettle as I was traveling with young children.
Safety
1) We decided to come home before dark as the area felt unsafe. When we came home at 7pm, there was another homeless guy sleeping at the walkway. We decided to order food to be delivered to the apartment. We felt trapped as the walkway and building entrance was not suitable for our needs and always blocked by homeless people. Our delivery guy had informed us that our food was snatched by one of the homeless who on either drugs or alcohol. That was when we decided to look for an alternative accommodation for the remaining of our stay.
2) Our apartment door was opened from the outside in the morning WHILE we were still there. When my husband enquired she said she didn't speak English (Spanish speaker). We decided to check-out after our first night there as we were concerned about our safety.
3)This is not suitable for family. It is not a MODERN 5-Star Apartment if the entrance is a home for homeless.
	The shower and bathroom was 2-star
	The cleanliness is zero star
	Both beds were sofa beds (not one bed and one sofa bed as claimed)
	Very poor amenities
	Unsafe area for families

The Host
She didn't meet me or call me even once although I called the emergency number. She only communicated using the AirBnB messaging and response was slow. Didn't provide any hospitality or assurance what-so-ever.
She claimed to have visited the apartment to take pictures on the cleanliness BUT didn't even have the courtesy to come up to check on us. She also said she lives around Camden!!!
 It felt like the reason why she visited the apartment was to take pictures AFTER she has cleaned the entrance and walkway to defend herself. Very disappointing. We didn't want to ruin our holiday and left. I lodge an official complain to AirBnB and Fernanda and she only wanted to give us a 20% refund despite us moving our after one night!!!
I logged a safety complain with AirBnB and the case manager worked on my case and I have received my refund.

Both payouts were due very close together. When no payment was received I checked my account only to find that somebody had hacked the airbnb page and added their detail as the Default Payout Party. Total monies lost - just under $2000 of which $1500 belongs to my clients and which I have to honour. I immedately contacted airbnb after changing my default details and password. I was told that the airbnb computer system was secure and that they had no idea how this could have happened. I was told my case was being referred to their Trust & Safety team to investigate, and that I would be contacted very shortly. Well over a week later, and almost daily calls by myself to airbnb, I am yet to get a call back from anybody, despite promise after promise to do so, and oh of course we so sorry this has happened. I have asked to speak to the Trust & Safety team to see what they are doing about my money. I am told today, get this - Oh the trust & safety team work in the back offices and they don't have phones. Well I kid you not, I nearly wet my pants I was laughing so much.
Now if that were not bad enough, here is stage 2 of Airbnb at its best.
I was invited to join airbnb's Plus programme where they send a party to your nominated property to inspect and do a photo shoot. This according to Airbnb will elevate your listing to a preferred status whereby potential guests will be convinced to book your property because you are a trusted host whose property has been inspected by their professional team. I put forward the 2 properties Airbnb had chosen from my portfolio, a date was set for each property, and here are airbnb's requirements.
Schedule your home visit
Choose a date and time for an Airbnb partner to visit your home in person. The visit will take 1-3 hours and includes an inspection and photoshoot. You or someone who maintains your property should be there the entire time.

Well you know what's coming next don't you. Yes of course, airbnb did not turn up to either property to either pre arranged time and date, and I had to pay my staff for sitting on their backsides watching TV waiting for airbnb to turn up.

So once again I have to contact airbnb to get a credit for $236 which they charged for these 2 non visits. But then again, they are oh so solly for what has happened.

Today I have reached the end of my tether. I have been told that the Trust and Safety Team do not have phones and when I requested to speak to a Public Relations Officer, I was told airbnb do not have one. I just got the old smoke up the ass blurb from robots, and the round robin treatment of "" well we cannot do anything from here as we are a call centre"". So I asked to be directed to a phone number to speak to somebody who can actually act with responsibility. Oh I am so solly, we cannot give out other numbers as we are only a ""call centre.

Time to go public and tell the news media. I know they just love this juicy type of story to get stuck into airbnb.

I am not afraid to give my name, phone number and email address.

63,"The public relations team is absolutely incompetent. They effectively stole $80 from me by canceling the co-hosts program with no notice given.
The program that allowed third parties to be paid a small fee by customers for helping an owner host them was canceled on August 1st of 2018. The ONLY notice sent was an email on June 27th, before I or the owner started co-hosting.
A company that cared about its users would give proper notice that people will no longer be paid for their work, not pretend that having sent a single email 2 months ago to some of its userbase is enough.

Imagine our shock when I had received an email from the host stating that the reservation had been cancelled. No reason, no explanation, just cancelled. You would imagine that a company would require its hosts to at least explain the reasoning behind their actions, but not all companies are Airbnb. To add insult to injury, Airbnb credited us $29 to go toward another booking. This seems like a fair gesture, if the reservation wouldn't have been cancelled literally at the last minute, that is. This left us with either having to pay a highly inflated price on a last minute option or choosing somewhere that wasn't particularly appealing to either of us. I took the refund. Airbnb is a failed experiment. You can't even contact them through email to express your displeasure. Save yourself a headache and just book a hotel.",1,“Absolutely terrible.”

To say the least this company has poor customer service and does not take any responsibility for any mishaps that occur at their venues.

They don't check out any of the venues they post on their site to see if they are legit and meet their standards. I recently stayed in an Airbnb that was evicted and then got thrown out of because I was told I was trespassing and staying there illegally after booking and paying for the place a month in advance. Customer service didn't take any responsibility for the fact that this place was a bogus rental on their site and even went so far as to say that that wasn't their fault or their problem. I was on the phone with them for over 2 hours and transferred to 5 different people trying to get my refund while also attempting to figure out another place to stay since I was now homeless for the night (which they also didn't give a sh** about).Makes me wonder how many other places they post up online that aren't safe to stay at either or if they even care.

67,"A SHAME !

I paid 1900euros for a room for one month and a half in London so I can do an internship at the French embassy.
When I arrived, the room was disgusting (I found a nail in one of the drawers of the bedside table, the desk was so dirty it was sticky, the wardrobe was so dirty I had to clean it for several days before I could unpack, the floor was full of stains...). The rest of the appartment was in a poor condition, the bathroom was disgusting as well, and the way to the balcony was dangerous (you have to go through a small window, the stairs are broken so you have to put your foot on a plastic stool on which lays a wooden board with nails on it). Also I didn't know they would be other guests in a shared room, and my hosts even put mattresses on the floor in their own bedroom so they can get more money! I started feeling insecure, when one woman came to me in the kitchen and told me she had to sleep tonight in the same room as another man whom she did not know, and was not aware of this before her arrival.

Then my relationships with my hosts started detariorating, as they were aggressive towards one of my friend who came for 4 nights (my host had given me her consent). They started to make false accusations (literally ""I think your friend borrowed something but I don't know what""), and lie (writing to me one month after my arrival that I ""shouldn't go to the balcony because it isn't safe"" the very same day she sees me taking pictures of the balcony to send to airbnb). I felt so insecure about them that I started getting home as late as I could.

I called airbnb to explain my situation to them and not only were they of no help, but they made me lose time, and made the situation with my hosts even worse.

I would strongly advise anyone not to use Airbnb services, as they really turned my stay here into a nightmare.",1,“A SHAME !”

I finally got better recently and started doing it again, a year later, and they want to penalize me by stealing $200 from my payout. Even after contacting them again and explaining it all over again, they refused to waive this penalty. So now my already paycheck to paycheck income is reduced even more this month. Thieves.

I can't begin to list all that was wrong with the place, but perhaps the best example was the mold growing on the heat register. Considering the place was a dump and the mold made my allergies intolerable, we had to check out after 3 days of a ten day reservation. But what really annoyed me was after I send an email of complaint to Airbnb, they had the nerve to respond saying it was a pleasure to speak to me and they were closing my case. The problem was they never spoke to me about my complaint. I could not believe the unmitigated gaul. I strongly recommend that you not use Airbnb because if you ever rent a place based on the pictures (which are misleading) or have to lodge a complaint with Airbnb, you will get some bull sh... response.

In the area we were supposed to stay in we were going to rent kayaks and lounge on the quite beach.  We ended up in an over populated expensive area.  The host left me a review saying that I probably lied about the whole thing so that I could stay in the more exciting environment.   She is accusing me of having that motive for not staying in her filthy place.  I didn't even leave awful feedback with description since I didn't want to completely ruin her reputation.  So now she's slandered me and called me a liar in public.   She has no idea who I am and if she did she Would know that I didn't want to pay double to stay in a double the price room.

I've called three times, asking to speak to a manager about contesting it and they always tell me they will escalate it and then have someone call me back.

82,"I am currently a host with Air BnB.  I have been since the year prior.  I received what is known as an ""Instant booking from a traveler named Jack  Instant booking allowed him to book my home without communicating with me and Air Bnb gets a fast booking.  I called Air BnB immediately because when I messaged this man, he told me he was proposing to his wife to be at my home and was having a BBQ with extra guests at my home.  I was not comfortable with this. The Air BnB  representative   told me that I could only cancel an instant booking once . Since I was worried about the consequences of needing to cancel again  (my rental season is only 8 weeks in duration) I elected to speak with this guest to insure that we were on the same page regarding the House Rule posted on my listing.  Instant booking allows a guest to instantly book your property and as such, an owner must expect without speaking to the guest, that he/she will abide by all the house rules.  This guest ""Jack"" did not.  I had over 50 cigarette butts left all over my yard, lit butts stuck between the decking slats causing small burns to my deck wood, beer tops in the pool, silk flower petals left in the pool which clogged the bottom drain, candles melted in the pool and submerged and clouded my pool which took two weeks to clear and over $50 of chlorine and hours of hand skimming, there was an amount of garbage as though there were 20 guests, filthy amounts of trash all over the lawn and around pool area, my home smelled of cigarette smoke and was extraordinarily filthy... 
Each time I call Air BnB I get someone from India who tells me they case is marked Urgent and it will be dealt with properly.  
I was coerced by Air BnB to accept this instant booking because I was told that I could only cancel one reservation and my vacation rental period is only 8 weeks long.- additionally, I was told, in writing, that if I cancelled instant booking that my rental property would be placed at a lower viewing position that other homes because Instant Booking on your account raises your home to a higher viewing position.  I attempted to message with this guest and thought we were on the same page insofar as the House Rules.  We were not, my home was destroyed by this guest and his band of cigarette smoking animals.  Because I was requesting payment from the guest myself (wherein he admitted to the damages and violating the house rules-in writing)   when I called an Air BnB representative and advised them of the damage, I told them I was dealing directly with the guest and it appeared that he was going to pay for the damages and extra cleaning necessary, I was never advised on TWO separate calls to Air BnB that I had no recourse after 14 days.  It appears as though the guest knew this. I actually advised Air BnB that I had damages within three hours of the guests departure and I further advised that I was asking the guest for payment.  The Air BnB representative were sent a copy of all written communication from the guest wherein he admitted to the damages and all other problems and agreed to pay.
Air BnB is not a USA based Company.  They do NOT give a crap about your home.  They simply want to make money and leave you hanging when there is damage.  All I receive from my calls is a representative from India, 'glad-handing' me and telling me that my case is re-opened, marked as ""Urgent""  and I should not worry.  Believe me folks...WORRY !!!

So Airbnb sent me an email to disgust the matter and they give me 72 hours to respond.  Well, I didn't see the e-mail and when I did they said that it was too late and they had reached their decision and was charging me 73.00.  I sent several emails on my behalf and they took the money out of my account without telling me when they were going to do it. Nor did they have authorization to pull money from my account.  Charge me, but don't steal from me....Be careful for apparently they can go into your account without you giving them authorization.",1,“Airbnb are theives”

102,"My girlfriend and I booked 3 Airbnb's for a trip to Hawaii. 2 of our Hosts so far seem great but the 3rd requested that we give them our personal email address, sign a rental agreement, and pay taxes via an outside payment method. We felt very uncomfortable about this and upon review at a later date found out that they had breach 14.1 of Airbnb's Terms of Service (https://www.airbnb.com.au/terms/) by requesting payment outside of Airbnb's Platform.

We contacted the Host and requested a full refund as their refund policy was strict and would only give is 50% back if we had cancelled it ourselves even though the reservation wasn't for another 6 weeks.
The Host refused and breached Terms of Service again by asking that we pay via PayPal.

Feeling extremely uncomfortable about all of this, we contacted Airbnb. They investigated the matter and told us that the Host had been misinformed by Airbnb staff about the correct process and was instructed to make all further payments through Airbnb's Resolution Centre. But, despite acknowledging the breach, they refused to process the refund because the Host was a 'valued Superhost'.

We have screen shots of Airbnb's verdict where they inform that they do not believe their was a violation before stating that the Host had violate the Terms of Service in reference to 14.1 which states 'request, accept or make any payment for Listing Fees outside of the Airbnb Platform or Airbnb Payments. If you do so, you acknowledge and agree that you: (i) would be in breach of these Terms'
They then go on to acknowledge that it is the Host's responsibility to pay any Host Fee and applicable taxes as well as the responsibility to include any other additional payments within their Listing Fees which was not done.

The only conclusion I can make from all of this is that Airbnb agrees that the Host has violated the Terms of Service but because they misinformed the Host of their responsibilities (even though they would have had to have read and agreed to the Terms of Service prior to becoming a host) they are unwilling to inconvenience the Host in case they loose a source of revenue.

Ultimately, I feel like my rights have been violated and I can safely say I will NEVER use Airbnb again.",1,"“Lower Price, Less Rights” "

Airbnb failed to protect its customers by notifying them that it had been hacked and would not accept responsibility but blamed me for the problem.  We only found out when we tried to get the address to the property.  The property was still listed even though Airbnb knew of the problem.

107,"For Mother's Day weekend we committed to a condo through AIRBNB. The ad said 1 bedroom with 4 beds. 3 queen beds and 1 single. When we arrived at the room it was a studio and only had 2 queen beds which would not accommodate our family of 5 adults. We took a screen shot of the ad and included a text from the host showing the number of beds. We also sent pictures of the 2 beds. The host must do a lot of business through AIRBNB and had another condo. It would not work for us. Lastly, the noise due to construction next door was unbearable. We recorded the noise and sent all of the info to AIRBNB. After we confronted the host he changed the listing. We left the condo paid a lot of money for last minute hotels. For 2 days we fought with AIRBNB trying to get a refund. They continued to assign different people to the case with the last person being from the Phillipines. 
When the host first gave us instructions he told us to tell the front desk we were friends with the owner of the condo and gave us her name. After 2 days of fighting with AIRBNB we told the host we were going to report him to the building mgmt. We even reported to AIRBNB he was leasing properties in a building which did not allow leases and forwarded his instructions requesting we say we knew the owner. It was at that time he said he would tell AIRBNB to give us our money back. AIRBNB wanted to charge us a $300 service. Their host client fradulently misrepresented the property and AIRBNB confirmed he did and would not support us until the host told them to give us a refund.

I was contacted 2 days later after opening a complaint against them. 
But isnt over yet, since I had no place where to go I decided to book an Hotel (only 3% of structures where available that day), then asked Airbnb for a full refund of the difference I had to pay between the hotel and my room (ca 600$), after about 10 days of back and forward they agreed a payment of 300$ cash.

They left ""host cancelled"" on the host's page, charge the host a cancellation fee of $50.00 that benefits airbnb and drop the super host. The worst part was that I wasn't able to leave a review of the host that cancelled on me, rather they let the host explain why they cancelled on the renter, which doesn't make sense because the host will obviously lie which is pretty much a one sided story being told.

My host asked me to cancel twice so she can keep her super host status and not be charge with the cancellation fee. On top of it all, if i had agree, I wouldn't have got my refund. I feel like not being able to leave a honest review of the host and why the host cancelled on me leaves a questionable area in the whole business.

When problems arise, you really are on your own. This is the risk. I've had hosts ask for cash transactions which is against Airbnb policies but even customer service is not aware of their policies until I did a copy and paste from their website. Very amateur responses from Airbnb and the hosts are hit and miss. Generally, the hosts all have been nice but their places and management lack a certain quality or minimum standard - signs of previous people living in the place (smell, hair, garbage) regardless of the cleaning fee you are charged, a film or grit that seems to cover the place, insufficient pillows or blankets, cheap beds etc. I've started looking on other sites after too many unsatisfactory experiences on Airbnb and I wished there were more places online that I could find reviews.

I tried submitting my credit card information again, getting the same error message. I tried using another credit card and got the same error message.

122,"Essentially, I wouldn't be writing this review had the company, its employees, or at the very least, the host (Lorrie in Austin, Texas - Casa De Los Good Times) had been half way decent enough to sympathize with the circumstance that we were in. When people are dying in a city that is under attack, not many would take kindly to being told that we should disregard this and just take the chance.

Horrible advice from an obviously biased and inconsiderate individual. 

We booked a visit to Austin a few weeks back, unaware that the following week and half there would be constant bombings taking place due to unfortunate events that took place in the City of Austin. 

airbnb has a policy that they call the Guest Refund Policy. This is supposed to come into play should the guest have any issue pursuing a refund outside of the normal cancellation policy. Now, once we got word that the bombings turned into 'trip-wire' events that were happening on residential streets we became much more reluctant to spend our brief vacation in a city that was being attacked like this. Rightfully so, I reached out four days before our stay (the moderate policy calls for a cancellation 5 days before the stay for a full refund) and politely attempted to explain our concerns hoping for some cooperation given the state of the city. 

Not all of our party was on board with the trip, so I decided it would be best to cancel and revisit the city at a later time. Unfortunately, for us, the host that we got was not so understanding. Lorrie basically put a wall up, tried to politely downplay the events when communicating with me, and would then push back through the airbnb attempts to ask for a honored full refund and explained that we could not pursue the full refund because she would be unable to book the room on such short notice. This was completely lacking the consideration of the climate in Austin at the time. Please keep in mind that airbnb stated that the final say on the refund would depend on whether or not Lorrie would want to honor it. She simply had to be a decent human being understanding a human level issue and failed to do so miserably.

This explanation from her to me would be sensible and I could understand the view in any other scenario, expect for that this was an emergency situation and we would be risking our health and lives coming out to Austin simply to appease her booking. I disagreed with this and instead chose to communicate with the airbnb team. I was looking for a full refund seeing as we would not travel to Austin.

I tried to exercise the so called 'Guest Refund Policy' which is said to protect the client under these types of instances. I then launched a five day call adventure with several different agents who pushed me from queue to queue and passed me along giving me all kinds of mixed information. I was promised a full refund at one point due to my 'extraneous' circumstance and later was denied this because, ""The Austin Bombings does not qualify as an emergency situation"". 

Being told this blew my mind and I was at a loss for words. How could this not be an emergency when neighborhoods are being evacuated and folks are dying due to explosions? I never got a solid answer on this. I was advised that airbnb goes off a of a particular list of media sources that gives them permission to decide whether or not a scenario taking place counts as legitimately ""Emergency or Extraneous"". I, of course, disputed this and called it ridiculous just as I will do so now in this review. To me, this sounds like a weak loophole to be able to deny people their returns. 

All in all, I ended up settling for a half refund, but this was only after I had to fight tooth and nail for days over the phone and try agent after agent until I received one that was willing to hear me out long enough to investigate in detail. This should not have been such an arduous process. I am sorry to say that I will not be using airbnb any time soon. 

Below is the grade for each individual agent that I spoke to while attempting pursue a refund. 

Alvita - F--- ,  The first person that I made contact with. She opened my case and apparently incorrectly because there was missing information when I called back. She was uninformed, pushed us off to the side after speaking to me TWICE and was generally unhelpful.
Halston - F---- ; Halston was our ""assigned case agent"" and he was very arrogant, unable to provide any reassurance that the client is important to the company; essentially made us feel like garbage, he is a lazy employee and should be reviewed by the company
Tiffany - C ; She did okay, and tried to clarify but did not help much in making progress
Aden - B ; Same as Tiffany, no progress made just a bunch of promises that didn't take place
Kai - He resolved my issue so I give him a B+, for his diligence and honesty.

Overall, this was the WORST of any customer care kind that I, or my party of 6 had ever experienced. It is unbelievable how dismissive and non-nonchalant the airbnb team was about resolving our supposed ""extraneous circumstance"". I will NEVER EVER recommend anyone that I care about to use any airbnb products in the future. 

The whole process just stinks of a general lack of humanity and I hope you take my experience into great consideration before doing business with them.

So first of all, Airbnb, you website is a users nightmare if they actually would like to book. I tried uploading my I.D. like 40 times before i gave up and had to contact your customer support and send them the picture to verify my identity.

So I booked a place in Paris which was nice, it was just like the way airbnb had shown it to be on the website. Cute Parisian apartment in Le Marais the host who were not there Guillaume & Marie really were above and beyond what they listed on their profile so for that- Marie & Guillaume get a gold star.

However, I booked what i thought would be a sweet place in Barri Gotic Barcelona which ended up being the biggest $#*!hole ever. Like it was legit a condemed building upon arrival.. when our taxi dropped us off he actually was so concerned he gave me the names of hotels he knew had openings in nice neighborhoods for a reasonable price- might i add I was there (Barcelona) during a cardiologist conference and most hotels in central locations had been booked out and there was no where near there to go.
So with this information i thought, let me just see what the inside looks like maybe its not so bad.. who knows? Well the inside looked like the set for the next Saw movie.. it was a squatters dumping ground and my host was a no show who kept messaging me on Whats app telling me she was there told me her neighbor would meet me, he was random kid from Belarus that did not speak english spanish or Catalan, was going to show me my room. To which I was like actually no, thanks I would like to survive my trip to Barcelona.

Then it was a second sleepless night on the couch. Next morning we cancel this reservation. Airbnb punished us for cancellation, but not the host for cheating and extorting money from us. Be aware, this company support host's cheating and money extortion from the Guests, don't count on their help, they would only waste your time and your money.",1,“Don't book on Airbnb ! Stay away!” 
131,"I had s totally unresponsive host. Airbnb kept saying ""Ill take care of it tomorrow if"" blah blah. Then they didn't. Excuse was they were sick. Both times. What a coincidence.",1,“Worst Customer service in the industry.” 
132,"The host's refund policy is 50% for unused nights. Airbnb states the possibility of more under extenuating circumstances such as feeling unsafe, speeding cars and being woken several times during the first and only night. 

When we finally reached the host on Sunday morning (after multiple attempts to reach her and finally texting with her (she stopped responding, we had to call her directly) AND after waiting 'on hold' for Airbnb for over an hour on the phone regardless of being alerted of only a 10 minute wait without my call ever being taken)  to negotiate a fair refund, she attempted to BRIBE us in order to get the stated 50% refund with a 5 star review. She initially gave us a 2 night refund for the remaining 6 unused nights. That's not even 50%. This is the stated refund when canceling by default,  not after being bribed to give a 5 star review - OR ELSE NO REFUND! This is totally unethical.

I expect that Airbnb could do more than recover only what is stated in the policy with extenuating circumstances, ESPECIALLY when we were subjected to being bullied in order to get (and not receive without your intervention) what is the stated refund. We have not left any review at this point, but cannot with a clean conscience leave even a 4 star review, but neither do we want to ruin this woman's business with a very negative review.  As a consumer with Airbnb, and dealing with unknown 'host' entities, we COUNT on these reviews as does Airbnb, I presume. 

Overall, we are disappointed with the whole encounter, with the host and Airbnb's inability to be reached 24/7, after 3 attempts and 2 different mechanisms. My call was left unattended waiting over an hour, even after a '10 minute wait notification'. This is not 24/7 service.

This was their response:

""Thank you for your patience while I reviewed your case. I appreciate the time youve taken to share your concerns and perspective on this experience.

Based on the information provided, I have decided that the refund you received is correct because the host is not held responsible for outside influences such as noise. 
 Thank you again for your understanding and for your valued time and contribution.

Have a good afternoon.

Sincerely,

Latona""

133,"After hosting 7 years (the first 1 year when Airbnb was a new company were fine) I'm moving over to home away and vrbo. I've had 100 properties at a time, however with the changing economy gone down To about 10 now. I have another 10 in Australia from June  but I won't be listing with Airbnb as I can't afford the losses when they take half your money.  I also have 2 hotels with  a total 48 rooms, but I've never bothered to advertise wth Airbnb as they just screw you over now. Back in the day they took care of hosts, handled resolutions fairly, but these days the host is ALWAYS wrong. I've just had $750 (4 nights stay) taken from a booking as the guest didn't have wifi for 2 days! Despite clearly the listing saying there is a maximum 1GB a day in usuage, Airbnb still took half the reservation cost from me. That's enough now. It's already a struggle to cover costs in the houses, then to add insult to injury a tiny bit of dust or a hair in a house that a guest complains about gets them 50% refund. I guess the number of hosts sucked into their web far outweighs the number of guests staying these days, so they need to keep those guests happy. I just hope that both guests and hosts look for other ways of renting their houses as Airbnb clearly doesn't take care of hosts anymore which is a shame as many people have been able to have help paying mortgages and bills.  I would NEVER rent from Airbnb, I would rent from home away or VRBO

Also, if you're currently a host and have great things to say about Airbnb (I did too in the past) just wait until you make a claim. I've had holes punched in walls, doors pulled off their hinges, trash everywhere....but Airbnb pays zero! So if you think that by renting your house you're covered with their insurance, YOU'RE NOT! They will just simply deny your claim then put at the end of the email, ""this is a final decision and won't be overturned"" don't take my word for it, read other hosts horror stories on this site and others then jump ship to somewhere that values your 24/7 work you do with guests, there are many other sites out there",1,“Airbnb scams hosts.

In the 41 years of my adult life I have never had a hotel call me back and tell me the ad was wrongly placed and now we want $504 for your reservation.

I had tried to reach a compromise with the host I went up from $1344 to $1650 out of pocket but AIRBNB steps in with their fees and that would take the price up to $1800

When AIRBNB got involved this is the response I got

Armani M, Feb 18, 12:58 PST:
If you have any questions, please let me know I want to help you out the best way possible, but I cannot honor paying for the difference. I can help you find a new listing and we can take it from there.

Please just try to work with me and I can see what I can do because I want you to have a great experience

Now there is 2 problems here

AIRBNB published a house for rent for $200 a night and the host didnt bother to check the add before it was posted.

The worst thing about this hole matter is CUSTOMER SERVICE no one not AIRBNB or the host will take responsibility for any of this mess and now the reservation has been canceled by the host, and now I have to wait at the very least 5 days to get a refund of my money.

We know this is inconvenient, so weve issued a full refund of $1344.00. While this refund is immediate on our part, it may take up to 5 business days for the refund to reflect in your account.

136,"Every dresser drawer and every closet was filled, and I mean filled, with this mans clothes. The clothes dryer was also filled. When confronted, the host replied, with attitude, ""What's your problem, just move my clothes out of the way"" There were only 2 clothes hangers available. 
   The TV was internet managed (to save money) difficult to control and of extremely poor quality. I watched the Superbowl with frequent interruptions (at key plays) by a spinning wheel and the notice that it was ""buffering"". 
   The bedroom windows had no blinds but fortunately because of the cold there was on one on the immediately adjacent outdoor decks.
   The bathtub drain did not work forcing me to buy a drain block at a local hardware store. The shower was barely acceptable.
   I was delighted after 10 days to check into a hotel around the corner for a bit more money. NEVER AGAIN.",1,“Not worth the saving” 
137,I am disgusted and appalled how customer service doesn't do anything to resolve issues instead they give you around 2 hours to submit some paperwork and quickly try to shut down your case. I got ill from a house I stayed in and left immediately and the greedy owner of course refused to give back my money. Customer service was no use just a bunch of generic replies. The worst part is you can't leave an honest negative review because it won't be posted. Collusion and deceitful.,1,“disgusting hosts and company” 
138,"RUN AWAY.  Airbnb will not protect you if anything goes wrong, and sometimes it goes horribly wrong.  In fact, they not only don't protect you but after they decide you aren't worth honoring their protection policies for, they won't even speak to you.  Lest you think this is just my opinion, I'd encourage you to do some further research.  A quick online search will review hundreds or maybe thousands of guests and hosts who have been screwed over by this company that pretends it's about community..  The high risk is not worth the bit of money you save as a guest or the huge potential losses as a host.",1,"“They'll cheat you if they can, and they can.” "
139,"I rented a place for 13 weeks while on a medical contract in Denver. A basement apartment with parking and shared laundry room(with the owner).
I arrived and met the owner when I was doing some laundry. Later that evening she texted me about there being a space heater if I needed it. Now that was odd, but I figured it was maybe to heat the bathroom for showers. I carry my own little one for just that reason. The third night I was there I was so hot I was sweating! I'm tiny..120 pounds so for me to get that hot is unusual. I looked and couldn't find the thermostat. So then I was told by the owner the space heater was there to use. What a shock to find out on day 4 of my 90 day stay that I have no access to the heat or air conditioner! There is no resolution for fixing this huge lie about heater and air conditioner as stated in her listing on Airbnb. Not being able to deal with that issue and already on shift at the hospital I called the resolution center. They spoke to the owner who then offered to let me text her whenever I needed the temperature adjusted. That was ridiculous to even try. I told them as much and explained I did not rent a shared thermostat. The listing did not say I would be nor did it mention using an unsafe space heater during the day when I was freezing and once again unable to adjust the temperature. The owner is gone all day so texting her isn't a resolution.Exhausted and getting no resolution I had to 're pack all my things, haul them up stairs and pack the car to go stay else where and then relocate for the remainder of my contract. This property was not as listed and texting the owner to adjust the temperature when she's not home or at 1am when I'm burning up is just illogical to suggest. However, Airbnb thinks it is absolutely appropriate and refuses to refund my money for this rental which I already paid over $1700.00 and was only able to stay 9 days. They are also trying to charge me more if she is unable to re rent. This is unbelievable as I have traveled 10 years and have never had an owner lie about the property then try to use texting as a resolution for temperature adjustments. The company in place to protect both owner and renter,however, allowing this behavior from an owner seems reasonable and the renter is left with no recourse or refund. According to the policies in place I am within my rights to demand a full refund for the days I was unable to stay because the basic heat and air where not as listed and it wass miserable.This seems to be a scam since they refuse to refund my money for reasons listed in their own policies. The last thing I wanted to do was move. It was a nice location and close to the hospital where I am on contract. I don't have thousands of dollars to just give away so this is very unsettling to say the least as I had to pay $2700.00 to secure another place last minute.Thankfully it has heat and air condition as every other place I've ever rented with the exception of this one on Airbnb.",1,“Heat and Air Controlled by Owner but not stated in listing refusing to refund” 
140,"Airbnb discourages you from looking at properties ahead of time. As a first time traveler with a pet I didn't know what quesetions to ask so after paying for a full month I ended up only staying one night because the logistics for getting my pup out to potty were not manageable. The host made sure I got my rental costs back, but Airbnb kept $200 in fees which were calculated based on the original month long stay. In otherwords they got 4 times as much as the host for absolutely nothing.",1,"“Great hosts, lousy company” "
141,"I would seriously recommend no one doing business with Airbnb!
Make sure you read ALL of their policies, especially when it comes to cancellations! I just had a group that was supposed to stay at our cabin during one of our busiest Holiday weekends of the year and they cancelled a few hours before they were supposed to arrive. They blamed this on the cancelled flight of a couple of their guests. The rest could still make it! They classify this as an ""extenuating circumstance"" and you are therefore left high and dry with absolutely NO disbursement of your deposit or any way to recoup any of the rental amount at all! So they basically can make up ANY type of lame excuse to get out of a booking up until the last minute, which is pretty sad. No other Hotel, Bed and Breakfast or any other online vacation rental site we use has this policy! The renter would have to typically forgo at least half of the rental amount if it's cancelled less than 30 days prior to arrival. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!",1,"“Cancelled a reservation on our place, NO refund at all !” "

143,"Six guests stayed at airbnb managed property in Maui (Paradise Properties) between December 20-27.  We were charged $1273 per couple for a week (more than $3500.00 total) for a unit that does not accommodate 6 adults - only 4.  We had to move furniture so we could all be together in the common area, eat in shifts, stack bags and belongings in the common room since there was no shelf, drawer closet or cupboard provided for extra two people.  Light bulbs were burned out, refrigerator shelves  broken, the mattress on sofa bed was horrible even when placed on the floor. Mainly there were no accommodations for two people at all which inconvenienced all of us.  We sent pictures, explained the situation in detail, and asked for a partial refund (for 2 people) -the host refunded our ""service charge"" of $200 and blamed us for not calling her about a burned out light bulb. We went through the ""resolution"" process with airbnb rep who also did not respond directly to actual concerns and blamed us for not calling.  She said she could not 'force' the host to refund money.  This is not a resolution process.  The accommodations were woefully misrepresented and customer service is appalling.  We will never use airbnb again and the six of us have told our traveling friends.  Airbnb must change their way of settling disputes by actually reading the complaint and attempting to find a reasonable solution.   Airbnb must use the leverage of refunding money to customers if they want their properties to represent their accommodations accurately. airbnb attempts to resolve the process is insulting - No one should be treated with such distain, especially customers.",1,“misrepresented accommodations and horrible resolution process”

I called many times to get this fixed, was put on hold for over 30 minutes at a time and was hung up on numerous amounts of times. From a big company like that it was simply garbage customer service. When asked to speak to a manager - he was disgustingly rude on the phone and also hung up on me.

But, that she would give me a discount and only request $300 from me instead of $500. This was dishonest behavior given I had conversed with her (during which the price was shown upfront) and I reported this to Airbnb requesting a full refund. However, Airbnb claimed the host did nothing wrong and they are entitled to ask me for more money. Airbnb reassured me no more money is owed, however, but this was not the point. The point was that I did not feel comfortable staying with a host who might unilaterally ask me for more money but Airbnb totally did not empathize. Airbnb sent me in so many loops when I tried to challenge this and I escalated this to a supervisor. The supervisor told me he will respond within 48 hours. Instead of getting me a refund, he got the host to send me a message reassuring me that I won't be charged extra after all but the damage has already been done. Just 2 hours after the supervisor sent me this update asking me if I am ok with this resolution, he sent a follow up saying that he will now close the case since he has not heard from me he assumes I am satisfied -  even though he only gave me 2 hours to respond! It just goes to show they have no interest in truly resolving a customer's complaints but just wants to wash his hands of the problem ASAP. I lost faith that Airbnb truly cares about its guests and called immediately to emphasize I still want my refund. It took me 3 calls. During the first two calls he was still in the office and I was assured he would call me back shortly. It was only during the third call that someone told me this supervisor had left the office and I asked to speak to someone else instead.

But later I understoond why there are so many good reviews (good scores) for awful apartments. It is just the policy of Airbnb. They do not want to spoil their reputation and image allowing to use the site bad hosts. That's why they do their best to escape negative reviews.
After my experience I have left a true review for the apartment and they cancelled it. The explanation was that the host provided them with some evidence that I was bribing money from him for a good review. I have provided our sms-exchange and wattsapp messages. But they took his side. It was especially strange and disgusting taking into consideration that the guy cheated with apartment description and there were awful conditions and his ad was a fraud.

My host canceled a 3-night booking in Mexico City on my day of arrival 2-hours before check-in.  Airbnb did not phone to alert me to this significant last minute development, but rather sent an email.  In the email, various ""alternatives"" were proposed - none of which were in remotely the same area of Mexico City, a massive metropolis - that I could book directly, or I could request my money back.  #1 - the alternatives were not comparable.  #2 - I had guests arriving within 2 hours, and did not have time to research, communicate and re-book (hoping that there would not be another last minute cancellation).  #3 - In lieu of availing myself of a non-comparable alternative that would have considered time and effort (and luck - there was very little time to pull all of this together) on my part to reserve, the only option that I was left with was to request a refund.  I was forced to book two hotel rooms last minute, incurring a cost $300 greater than my Airbnb booking.  Airbnb offered no further assistance or recompense for the stress and extra expense that resulted from using their platform.  Subsequently, I received a phone call purportedly to learn more about my point of view regarding what happened.  When I said that Airbnb failed in its customer service, and that it did not provide me with assurance, as a paying guest, that I could depend on pre-booked and pre-paid accommodations, I was informed that it wasn't their fault.  Problems happen, but Airbnb's management of the situation and subsequent follow-up was pathetic.

153,"I've used Airbnb a couple of times prior to this trip and had some decent experiences, but I will never use them again after this one. I will preface by saying that both my sister and I have traveled the world, been to many different countries and have stayed in hostels many times but never had an experience like this.

We booked a room in a house in New Orleans. The house stated that it was on Frenchman Street  for those of you who are not familiar with this area, its a popular destination in New Orleans, lined with bars and restaurants where all the locals go to listen to live jazz music. Unfortunately, Airbnb does not disclose the exact address of the house until the day before your stay, they give you a radius to give you a general idea of where its located. Well, when we arrived at the house it was on the very far end of Frenchman Street, not at all in walking distance to that area as described (nor would it have been safe to walk, day or night, male or female, EVER). It was in a very bad, crime ridden area with bars on many of the windows and doors, and wood paneling covering windows that had been blown out. The house was not at all how it was described in the ad. We stepped outside for a moment to contemplate if it was safe to walk just around the corner to Walgreens, and within a few minutes someone made an attempt to rob us. I will spare the long details of this but luckily we escaped the situation unharmed. When we ran back into the house we discovered that someone left the door to the back patio unlocked. This was a shared space, meaning other guests were staying in other rooms just down the hall.  Luckily no one had entered the home from off the street but we feared that if the guests accidentally left it unlocked again, that someone could enter the home in the middle of the night and rob us or worse. Also, there were no locks on our bedroom door, leaving our belongings at risk while we were out exploring the city. I realize that New Orleans suffered awful devastation from Hurricane Katrina and is still recovering and its really sad, but, Airbnb should be more forthcoming about the state of these houses/rooms.

This place was completely misrepresented. It said there was a porch overlooking the yard as well as street and two sets of french doors that open up into Frenchmen Street, letting in plenty of light and allowing for prime people watching. The french doors in the kitchen were bolted shut, and the only view from the porch was a very tall fence that separated the back of the house from the street, we couldnt view the street as stated. In addition, the house was unsanitary. The pillows were stained brown (very brown, spotted, DISGUSTING), the towels that were folded and placed on the bathroom counter were damp and smelled like mold, the toilet wasnt completely bolted down to the ground, etc.

Unfortunately Airbnb has a refund policy that protects them from just about anything. We contacted their customer support line immediately and worked with a case manager in an attempt to get a refund but they refused. They said that they cannot refund due to neighborhood factors, only things pertaining to the house itself; so we sent the pictures of the house and everything inside that was dirty (including those nasty pillows) but they still refused. We were also shocked that there were no reviews about any of these things which leads us to believe that perhaps the negative reviews are being deleted. After the incident I decided to do some more research on the company, and found that other people have experienced the following situations (also without refunds): door locks being broken when you arrive, getting kicked out of the house by disgruntled ex-spouses, cancelling peoples stays hours before their reservation, hosts openly using drugs in common spaces, getting kicked out by HOA reps because the host doesnt have rights to rent, not refunding people who were supposed to stay in Napa Valley during the devastating fires just to name a few. I dont care what their policy states, they should operate by whats right and whats wrong. This company has no moral compass whatsoever. It sounds like just about anyone can qualify to rent their space through Airbnb and misrepresent it in their ad. I would highly advise against using this service.",1,"“nightmare, don't do it” "

We supplied well documented pictures and a written estimate from the contractor with a full assessment of damage and costs to repair. Airbnb told us that our contractor must have a raised seal on his estimate paperwork and it cant be a Word document. We told them a small family owned contractor business does provides estimates on a home computer with simple letterhead. Then they wanted a video of the danage in addition to photos. It was a complete runaround and then they denied us payment. We are disgusted.

159,"My maiden voyage with airbnb ended up a disaster!  My online experience with airbnb was a bit clumsy  but i figured it out and was able to make a reservation ""Mountain Peek - Hosted by Jamie + Melissa"" on September 27, 2017, I thought everything was fine and i was so excited to be able to experience this area from a new perspective.....  Until, 2 days before we were supposed to be at this unit and the host cancelled our reservation.  No reason was given,  the airbnb folks said it was because ""she was uncomfortable"".   I complied with everything that was asked of me and even filled out a profile in it's entirety in order to give enough details about my personal life to give anyone considering our requests a level of comfort.   

The host cancelled the morning i was in communication with him/her via airbnb text, but in the texts, the host stated that the reservation was cancelled the day before. (the cancellation email was sent out the morning i was in communication - in fact 10 minutes prior).   The hosts  also told the airbnb folks that we had 9 people coming, and that was not true either, we only had 7 (and two of those were last minute tag alongs)  The home was supposed to house a total of 7.    

I contacted airbnb and asked them if there was a vetting process for hosts, and guess what, according to my representative, the answer is no.  So there you go.  I went on the airbnb site to give an official review to this host, and guess what, that is not allowed either.  How am i to know that there were not more dissatisfied  folks out there having their plans cancelled the last minute?  I don't!  All i know is that i am going to stick with the tried and true.

You could not possibly get any worse customer service nor waste more time trying to resolve the simplest problem; no client satisfaction whatsoever.

163,"Hi,

I have hosted my apartment for 2 months in Germany to Korian-canadian guy, who has recently moved to germany for work. It is shared accommodation that mean Private room and remaining, Living room, Kitchen and bathroom are shared. He has booked a private room from 30.11.2016 to 31.01.2018 and unfortunatly he had to travel to germany on 27.11.2016 because of Visa procedure. I have accepted that too and things went fine for first two weeks after his arrival. 
It was my vacation time where I had traveled to India on 09.12.2016 to 16.01.2017 which was also informed him before the reservation was being done. On 09.12.2016 my Owner has visited the apartment and I had introduced this tenant to my owner. I left to India on 09.12.2016 and after that he has brought his girl friend on 13.12.2017 to apartment without informing me which I came to know though my Owner on 21.12.2016. Then I was not comfortable with him to keep him stay where I have shorthened his stay to 25.12.2017 through AIRBND request which was also accepted by him within 30 min.
He along with his GF had to leave the place by 25.12.2017, however he did not vacate the place and started staying further. I was not able to control the situation because I was in India. I had complained so many times to AIRBNB, however there was no action taken by them. 

He started disturbing neighbors where my was contacted by neighbors for morethan 6 times in late nights. My owner has come with police on 08.01.2017 and thrown him along with his GF out. 
Then my owner found the Damages (Wardrobe, holes on the walls, broken lamps, missing few kitchen items). My owner has written to Tenant an e.mail asking his explanation regarding the damages where he just answered that the damages were there when he arrived to apartment. The argument went-on for weeks and then Tenant stopped responding for our mails.

I had created a complaint to AIRBNB, where they had responded trice initially and then stopped responding for my request. My complaint was that the Tenant should pay back the rent for remaining stay (from 26.12.2016 to 08.01.2017) and the damage cost (estimated to 1750 eur). I had called to AIrbnb customer care after 2 months of this issue and then they started to work on this complaint again. AIRBNB offered me 140 eur as rent for his further 14 days stay and about 120 eur for the missing items (plates, glasses, cups). AIRBNB argues also that the Wardrobe, wall damanges, Lamp cannot be considered for damage since those come under usable items.
I had not accept this offer since this was unfair, so AIRBNB simply closed this complaint. I am proceeding legally to get the unpaid rent and damage cost from Tenant.  

I agree provides suitable accommodation, however the customer service and the responses to customers are not at all good. AIRBNB had the customer rating was 4 out of 5 and now it has 1.6 out of 5. I still do not understand why AIRBNB is not taking care of this.",1,“Damages at apartment” 
164,"There are good rentors out there.  I have experienced the hospitality of great hosts and had excellent Airbnb experiences.  However there are bad ones and Airbnb does not care and require documentation of such a horrible experience.  

The one star is for a horrible experience that I encountered in Seattle and Airbnb still stands by their position of zero help, others on the trip were fine.  They obviously care more for the money then a rentee's experience.  YRMV.  

After being on the road for 12 hours, I got to my rental in Sammanish.  I hope it would be basic and clean place to stay as I booked it for nearly a week..  My expectations were wrong.    

No exterior lights were on.  I used the front hillside terraced stairs which were at least 20 feet and could have been unsafe.  A kid answered the door and directed me to the open garage to access the room more directly.  He warned me about spider webs on the stairs. Okay.

So I went thru the garage and checked out the room. Basic okay.  I started unpacking and settling in.  I noticed there was no key.  I went upstairs and another kid was there, smoking something.  Foul smelling.  MJ is illegal for anyone under 21.  He called for his mom.  His mom gave me a tour and told me there was no key for the room.  I was uncomfortable with this.  She said her husband would be back Monday night with the key.  I was exhausted from the ride and made no comment.  During the tour, the lights were out in two parts of the common area, the main living room and the hallway.  She told me they were out for awhile, maybe she said a month or two.  She asked me about them but I am no electronic and couldn't help.  A broom was knocked over on the kitchen floor and water was spilled on the kitchen counter, she said from above.  Okay.

The smell of whatever that teenager was smoking filled my room. The air was unbreathable and I have no clue what drug that teenager was smoking.  I had enough.  This place was not as advertised and beyond what I was comfortable with.  

I called Airbnb, they could do nothing.  Zack, the case manager, was unhelpful to say the least.  At this time, I did not mention the drug use as I am no rat.  I left after only 30 minutes to 1 hour of this foul environment.  Zack requests documentation of the illegal drug use.  I don't see how I can ask that kid to prove his license nor did I want to get into a discussion with the mother about supervising her children.  I did not think to take pictures of the lights being out.  

It is truly sad that Airbnb does not care about rentee's experience and doubts the word of an experienced traveler and user of Airbnb.  What a headache and very disappointing of an otherwise excellent Airbnb experience.  With a hotel, you know what to expect.  Airbnb should be ashamed to have a garbage rental like this to be part of their business model.  I sadly did not read carefully what other reviewers mentioned and failed to mention.  I don't like talking nor using the word garbage but this experience definitely is garbage and not one I wish on anyone.

I am seriously considered using a known hotel chain for my future business.  Zack's signature sign off is ""Be the Adventure"", the real truth is your room experience with Airbnb will be the adventure.  Staying at a hotel and you will know what you are getting.",1,“Useless Customer Service” 
165,"A celebration was very quickly transformed into a monumental tragedy.  Within a few hours of arriving to this home a part of our group was exposed to bed bugs- resulting in us all needing to take precautions to avoid further insult and injury. While Deans employees attempted to rectify the horrific experience it was a impossible feat given that the second location we were taken to in their array of apartments also had bed bugs upon inspection.  Costas was understandable and as kind as a person could be.  Lia attempted to remedy the situation and found a place to stay with another agency, but failed to inform them of entire situation putting us in a position to explain.  They were obviously very upset and unhappy.  We ultimately didn't stay with Airbnb- and fully blame Airbnb for their lack of a crisis plan, poor guidelines and policies and negligence.  The company is not prepared for any such circumstance and believes it's within their rights to keep our money despite what happened during our first partial night stay in one of their registered apartments.  The apartment we ultimately stayed in was not near the area we planned for, but was free of bed bugs so the bar was pretty low.  Overall a god awful experience that I would not wish on my enemies.  To say the cost to our overall group far exceed the cost of the apartment is a grand understatement to the tune of a few thousand dollars.  I would stay away of boutique Athens until they understand completely how to manage communal apartments for travelers.  I would also implore you to look elsewhere to book a place.

I booked my trip and got to my new home for the week, where I was dropped off along with a huge carful of my stuff (to avoid renting a moving van, we decided to bring stuff down in different trips). The host was nice and the place was older, but clean. But I quickly realized there was an issue when I found roaches running around the kitchen and the bathroom. I took pictures and contacted the host, who was mortified and apologized for it, saying she would send maintenance out that day to take a look and spray. Maintenance didn't come, and for another few days she kept giving me excuses about why they didn't make it over yet. After having a roach scuttle across the bathroom floor as I was getting out of the shower, I decided enough was enough and that I would call AirBnB. I thought it would be a quick process since obviously the listing had vermin, but I was on the phone for FOUR HOURS  from midnight until 4am. They were originally refusing to refund anything except the nights that I didn't stay at the residence (if I checked out early), but eventually I did receive a full refund for the nights I didn't stay, as well as a 50-percent refund for the nights that I did stay, free accommodation at a different AirBnB location for the remainder of my stay, and compensation for the UberXL I needed to transfer my stuff to the new accommodation. Sounds pretty good, even though I had to fight for it  but then when I got to the new residence, I found that there were MORE roaches there too. I made this video and contacted AirBnB customer service again. I requested a hotel room for the remaining two nights since I didnt want to stay at another AirBnB location, for obvious reasons. I also asked for my stuff to stay at the dwelling since it was already paid for and I had no way to move it again  especially through a hotel (do you know how many trips on the elevators I would need? Let alone another Uber which I would need to pack and unload!). The supervisor I spoke to told me that they could only pay for one hotel night, saying I could use my refund to pay for the second night in a hotel, and that they would only pay for the one hotel night if I canceled the current booking, which I needed for my stuff. Let me remind you that my refund and paying for the new accommodation was meant to remedy the first roach-infested dwelling. Paying for two nights in a hotel would remedy this current dwellings affliction. But nope! AirBnB wouldnt make it right. Now I have potentially brought roaches into my new apartment, and AirBnB definitely doesnt reimburse for pest control!

183,"I have had an absolutely abysmal experience with Airbnb, and I have nothing but negative things to say about the host that cancelled my reservation as I landed in Miami the hour before I was due to check-in, about Airbnb not doing anything to resolve the issue, and about Airbnb's response to the situation after the fact. First, the host cancelled on my friend and I while we were in our flight to Miami from Chicago. Their only resolution was a downgrade from a 2 bedroom unit to a 1 bedroom unit which was not only unacceptable, but a poor show of good faith. Airbnb refused to find us a comparable or better listing the day of and cover any difference from our agreed upon price, and asked us to book another listing from our phones while we were at the airport the day of, which unsurprisingly yielded no results of equal value and all results were extremely overpriced, as would be expected for a day of booking in Miami. The least Airbnb could have done was found listings for us and paid the difference in cost from what we paid, much like Stubhub does when a customer receives bogus tickets through their service. Lastly, my friend left the hosts a terrible review, rightfully so as they ruined our trip to Miami, and the hosts returned the favor leaving my friend an equally terrible review even though the hosts cancelled on us! To make matters worse, Airbnb just took down my friend's negative review of the hosts, essentially not allowing us to leave a rightfully and truthful terrible review on the hosts. When a host cancels on a trip booked a month in advance on the day of, they deserve a poor review and other potential customers deserve to see the poor review and skip on booking with the host. Neither I or my friend are able to review the poor hosts on our cancelled trip, and the poor review that our host left my friend is still up. This is quite possibly the worst customer service I have ever experienced, and I am appalled that Airbnb would treat their customers like this. I will be posting poor reviews of Airbnb on every social media site and review site that I can find just to inform other potential customers to simply stay away from such a terrible service. It is not the fault of Airbnb when a host cancels on a customer, but the host should be severely penalized for doing so, especially the day of, and the customer should not only be made whole, but should be given an equal or better accommodation at no cost to the customer. It is then the absolute responsibility of Airbnb to make every effort to make the customer whole after the fact, as the cost of a cancelled trip on the day of the trip has much greater emotional harm than just the actual monetary cost of the situation. I am not sure how to describe what booking a new vacation from the airport on a cell phone is like in Miami without using very colorful language. It was a disaster. Airbnb has an absolute responsibility to at least allow its biased review system to be utilized in cases like this and to not cover up the atrocious behavior of its bad hosts. I cannot fathom why this part is particularly so frustrating. The good thing about social media is that even when a company decides to conceal its dark and shady treatment of customers on its own website, they cannot stop the disgruntled customers from spreading awareness through other platforms.",1,“HostBnB”

- Stove top had burnt food all over it
- Carpets were stained and had to be shampooed which is far and above the normal clean we would need to do after guests leave
- There was dog food in the couch cushions
- Toilets were plugged up and had all kinds of items that had been attempted to be flushed down including face wipes and tampons. 
- Garbage was put in a coat closet
- The bedrooms were a mess with food, drinks, games everywhere and the furniture had been all moved around (which we specifically ask our guests not to do)

Eventually after an hour passed (it was no after 6am) I was called by a man called Michael who said he was the host when in fact in the ad the host is a woman called Schchen
Mikael told me that he would be over in 30mins with a spare key 
10mins later I receive another call from Michael informing me that he cannot get the spare key because the office is closed and will not open till 9am
My only options were to either sleep in the hallway or check into a hotel. Michael suggested I go and wait in a hotel lobby. I informed him that I would do no such thing as I would not want the staff at the hotel to perceive I was there doing something untoward
Mikael told me to call him later in the morning and we would arrange a suitable time for us both to meet at the flat and I would receive a refund for that night
After 7am I checked into a hotel and after 4 hours sleep called Mikael and we arranged to meet at the flat at 1pm
I arrived at the flat at 1pm, waiting for my outside was a young man who told me his name was Julius 
We both accessed the main door to the building using the key I was given on the previous day
We made our way up to the second floor and stood in front of the door to the flat. I then handed him the key to open the door - low and behold the door opened. I told hi that it was not so easy to open the door yesterday 
Julius then went onto insinuating that I went to the wrong door, was I at the right door. I responded that of course I was, its the only door with the metal panelling on the left hand side and there are only 3 levels in the building. He said that because there was no issue with the door I would not receive the refund for that night. I was very annoyed by this, I had to spend over £100 to book a room for the night due to the faulty lock
We both entered the flat I saw that Juliuss phone was in the flat by the desk - it was charging I relaid that this charger was in fact mine but it was in my bag and not in plain sight. This further exasperated and annoyed me further. That he was insulting my intelligence, accessed the flat without my permission and then used my property to charge his phone.
For that reason I told him to leave and to end the argument as we were getting nowhere and I wanted to leave - I no longer felt save and felt violated that someone who thinks its ok (regardless of whether he works for/owns the property) to let himself in without me bing there and to touch my property
I explained to him that I would be checking out and would no longer stay at the property because of his unscrupulous behaviour. I confronted him that there was an issue with the lock and he must have rectified the issue either himself/called a locksmith prior to my arrival. Therefore alleviating themselves of the promise to refund me for the night
Therefore I made the decision to leave and go back to the hotel
I contacted Airbnb and spoke to a representative called Joe. I explained the situation to him and he could clearly hear on the phone how upset I was upset by the situation
He informed me that is my decision to leave - my response was I no longer felt safe being in the flat. He said that he would send me an email and once I had checked into the hotel I should provide him with supporting evidence of what had taken place

I have been visiting for 2 years and go 2-3 times a year. I have stayed at hotels and Airbnbs - I have never had an issues with gain access and the hosts at whos properties I have stayed at have given me glowing feedback. I felt o strongly about how I had been mistreated a dutch friend of mine who lives in Amsterdam reported the host and the management agency to the Amsterdam city hall.

I have escalated and written to Airbnb twice to give me the contact details of their legal dept as I do not agree with the outcome of the decision made. My emails have gone unanswered!",1,“I will NEVER use a company that tolerates bad behaviour and theft”

187,Terrible service my daughter booked us a five night stay in London. About two weeks later she got notification that the host had canceled our stay due to the fact that the owner of the property no longer allowed her to rent it out. So we made another reservation. We also booked five days in Paris.   Now we have received notice that that apartment is also no longer available due to the fact that the actual owner of the property did not want to properly used as an Airbnb and the tenant was just using it as an Airbnb. Airbnb does not vet or screen any of its properties properly so there is no guarantee that the owner of the property is actually the person Renting it out on Airbnb. This is an Airbnb problem they are not responsible as the middleman. They claim people can click on a button stating that they own the property but there is no research or guarantees going into that. And of course people will lie. And yet I had to submit my drivers license  to have my background checked to verify that I was an OK prospective renter. Airbnb is just out to make money and doesn't really care how it messes with people with their vacations.,1,“Terrible service” 
188,"1. Prices is not what u seen on screen. The price you see on screen is just a scam to get you click the booking button. Price jumps all the times. They charge too high with their service fee.

Do you have a vacation home that you are considering renting out to guests?  Have you considered using Airbnb to find guests?  if so, host beware!

We felt comfortable sharing our home due to Airbnbs $1.000.00 Host Guarantee: Your peace of mind is priceless. So we dont charge for it.

We thought they meant it.  When we submitted a claim on June 19, 2017 with pictures of the damage (an exterior wall had been sprayed with some kind of a substance in the shape of a face) and estimates for its repair, we expected reimbursement.  We didnt even get a response until July 4, 2017 and that response simply said someone would be in touch.  We sent the documentation again.  On July 17, almost a month after the claim, we heard from Airbnb.  They asked for documentation of the damage and a picture of the wall before it had been damaged.  Needless to say, we dont take pictures of every wall between guests so we were unable to provide the required documentation.

We are ending our relationship with Airbnb and will not be reimbursed for the damage.  We hope we can at least, help others avoid a similar situation.",1,“Host Beware!”

He said his mother cleans and he was sure they were clean.  Then let us know there were more sheets in the dryer.  They smelled so dirty without putting them up to our noses.  In the midst of EVERYTHING else to do, we had to stop and buy sheets to put on the bed.  Airbnb refunded our cleaning fees but that's all.  The moldy smell hits you as you walk in the house.  The mustiness never left.  Zach was very defensive so we didn't contact him again.  DON'T STAY IN ZACH'S PLACE!

197,"Took about 3 hours and much scanning, etc. to meet Airbnb's requests.  Have used Airbnb back in 2016 and early 2017, and booked a stay in August just about a week ago.

Have been searching Airbnb for a future stay over the past month almost every other day, to stay in a city that is having a convention.  Hard to find places that are reasonable and even available 6 months in advance.  A host and I were having a good conversation and they gave me a deal - they changed the price on the dates of interest for me, and all I had to do was book it.  I couldn't!   When I went to book it, Airbnb said my original photo (that allowed 3 other bookings) was not a quality photo and they wanted a new one.  I don't like having photos on line, but in order to continue, I clicked on the link to load another photo that I have on my laptop.  Well, just a regular photo is not sufficient - they wanted a License, Passport or Visa.
This, from the standpoint of hacking and giving out important docs is a no-no.  BUT, I did scan my license, front and back, scanned both sides and loaded it.  They then wanted a photo, and it had to be loaded via their app (apparently on a smart phone) or via the browser.  I don't have a smart phone and though I've had a laptop with a camera, I had never used it as I don't have a reason to and it is also a security risk.
The camera didn't want to work.  After about 2 hours, I got the camera to work - I had upgraded from Win 7 to Win 10, and the drivers were not apparently good.  So I found the drivers and installed.  Now the camera seemed to want to work.  I had the web browser/camera take a pic.  After ALL this, it allowed me to continue, to book, but only got so far.  They then told me that I had to redo the license because I had scanned it in Black and White.   So I rescanned in color, both sides, loaded it up.  Took another photo via the camera, and went ahead.  Got another error indicating that the license had to be an unmodified scan/image.  I had modified the area of my social security number, as again, this is a major violation of security and this is going to be stored on line where Airbnb WILL eventually get hacked.  So I had to rescan the license, again in color, and this time give up my own personal security.  This worked and I got to make the request to book for the dates and apparently at the price that the host and I agreed to, assuming that all is well, but it is now in the host's hands.  (Though I think I have resolved my issues, past experience indicates they will not like something or another thing will come up.)  

I had contacted Airbnb Customer Service when I had the issues noted above - not an easy task by the way. I explained that I had been a member for 3 years plus, had used Airbnb twice in the past, had just booked a $1000 stay last week and was now being challenged.  (I was challenged a few months back, but I got an email out to customer service and she said that it was a mistake and reset things.)  One of the two hosts in the past indicated that they would love to have me back as I was the cleanest person that they had rented too - also said from a small hotel I stayed in in Sri Lanka.  I was on the line with the rep for about 5 mins on hold as he checked to see what could be done about not using my camera on my laptop.  Problem is that most people have phones that access the internet, can text, can do photos - not my flip phone.  I was told there was no way around this - so I had to go to a library, use a friends computer or find another computer/device with an internet connection where I could log into my account and take that photo.

Having ones License, Passport or Visa information stored away in a company's database is not a very re-assuring thing, especially with all the hacking that goes on.  I've had a government secret clearance in the past, and we are taught to fly under the radar - photos, IDs, important social security numbers, etc. shouldn't readily be given out.  I try to keep a very low profile - I have been the host of my own tv show, have appeared on tv shows/books/magazines/newspapers, etc.  I don't want my information or photos floating around out there - one is asking for trouble if this info is out there at all.

If I have been using Airbnb for a few years, had good reviews, there have been no issues with payment or issues of any kind, I can't see the reason for them to demand all the info that was recently requested.  This was also a timely issue - as a host had made some changes so that I could do a booking, asap.

Those using Airbnb are walking on egg shells - just waiting for them to have issues with data loss due to hacking.  This important information shouldn't be in the hands of a company like this.",1,"“Have Booked Stays with Airbnb, and now they want more ID!...” "
198,"Airbnb is a very incomprehensible website that makes it very difficult for you to change or cancel dates and track the money you've paid. 

I made a long-term reservation for 62 nights and before departure I got a severe accident and had to cancel the trip. I couldn't somehow enter the webpage so I contacted the host that seemed so nice before to cancel the reservation. It was 5 days before departure. But the host never responded and because of my health condition I couldn't follow-up until today. I realised the cancellation policy is to pay 1 month + extra a lot of money for I don't know what.

I asked for an ACH which, normally, takes a few hours. They didn't send the payout ACH. I called for assistance and was lied to several times. The supervisor, Michael, told me that there was a problem with the guest's payment. I had verified weeks earlier that the payment had been received in full.

The only thing I can review is the pre-booking and Contact host system which, for me, proved very frustrating.

Recently I spent the better part of an afternoon going through the snakes and ladders registration process and after assistance from a very friendly, thorough Customer Service Rep. I was all set.

I then spent some time learning about the listing format, maps, pricing etc.

So being ready use Airbnb, I set out to find a nice suitable 4 day stay, at a specific location and time.

4 requests, 4 failures.
Request 1;
Immediate reply was a bait and switch as the host was really looking for a month long pet sitter and wanted to meet off airbnb.
Request 2;
No reply and within a few hours the site showed This listing is no longer available.
Request 3;
Quick reply but stated they were changing to longer bookings than the 3 day minimum stated, would be changing their calendar and were denying my request unless I wanted to book longer. More bait and switch? A week later the calendar still shows 3 day min.
Request 4;
Very similar to 3 above; a quick response, with apologies, for not keeping their calendar up to date. Said current guest would be staying longer than originally planned. This is July and I was looking for time in October. Strange.

Another disturbing element is the number of times guests have had bookings cancelled by hosts, sometimes only days before arrival, like alan0721 above. Imagine that chaos.

Complaining on the Airbnb Community Center will only hurt because it is run by hosts.

So, I will not give up yet but so far, I am not impressed.",1,“Can't even book.”

They make sure their site looks like a safe place VIA REVIEWS and the REVIEWS are a total SCAM because you can ONLY LEAVE reviews at the end of your stay.  If your host cancels on you after you arrive, NO REVIEWS ALLOWED!  Can you imagine that?  You book a place for a week, pack up your things and family, arrive at your destination and your hosts cancels and there is nothing, absolutely NOTHING you can do--AIRBNB does not care!  And they make sure you cannot tell anyone about your hosts action! You're stranded in a busy vacation area and then have to pay out of the nose for a place that likely isn't even close to where you expected to be!

Any positive reviews on the site are useless because if everyone were allowed to leave reviews of their TRUE experience the place would go out of business.  

I hope someone takes this idea and RUNS IT CORRECTLY and monitors and makes it safe and guaranteed and runs this AIRBNB out of business.

The room itself was clean and acceptable, and the people I communicated with via text and phone seemed friendly, although we had to play several hours of ""phone tag"" to finally settle things.

216,"On April 21 2017, we reserved the master bedroom of Alex's appartment in Hollywood. The listing claimed the following :
All amenities included.
APARTMENT FEATURES:
- you get your own master bedroom with a private bathroom, closet, balcony
- Sleeps 3 (third person can choose to sleep on living room couch or airmatress)
- FREE WiFi
- Central Air Conditioning and Heating
- Hardwood Floors (carpeted bedroom/walk in closet)
- All brand new furniture and apartment
- Dishwasher, Microwave, Full Size Stove
- Laundry Facilities inside the unit (modern washer and dryer)
- Cleaned by professional maids
- Full Kitchen
- Extra Comfortable Mattresses, 600 thread count sheets, High Quality Comforter Sets
- Chic and modern design
- Stainless Steel appliances
We demand a refund for the following reasons.
Before reserving, we asked for more pictures, because only one was provided in the listing. A woman claiming to be Alex said that she did not have any at the moment. When we saw the apartment, we understood why she would not provide pictures.
We did have our own room with a private bathroom. However:
	It was very sparsely furnished -- just a bed and a TV. No bedside table or lamp, no dresser, no chairs, and no sofa, contrary to what was shown in the picture.
	We had to ask for the air mattress, which was stored in a pile in the dirty living room.
	It smelled like cheap perfume in the room, as if someone wanted to hide a bad smell.
	The bath, sink, and mirror were dirty.
	The only linens that were provided were 5 face cloths and a hand towel.
	The blinds did not work properly, missing many slats
	The balcony was cluttered with stuff belonging to other people (and Alex responded that he wasn't responsible for the comings and goings of the people in the apartment!)
	The room could only be locked from the inside, so we could not lock it when we wanted to leave. Furthermore, the front door was always unlocked. Alex only gave us the key to the building, not to the apartment, claiming that there was always someone there. Therefore, both the front door and the door to our room were always unlocked, so we could easily have been robbed.
When we confronted Alex about these problems, he made up excuses and said he would get the air mattress (which he did) and extra linens (which he didn't). When we explained our problems with the state of the apartment, he replied that we had only rented a room, disregarding the fact that we were supposed to have access to the kitchen, which was in a horrible state. 
Now for the rest of the appartment:
	There were 4 or 5 occupants in the living room and kitchen when we arrived (alone, because Alex did not accompany us). These were all temporary lodgers or couch surfers, judging by all the couches and air mattresses.
	The kitchen and fridge were dirty and smelled bad, just like the rest of the apartment.
	No coffee maker, no glasses. We only managed to find 2 cups.
	When we woke up, six people were sleeping in that mess of a living room.
We have traveled a lot (often using AirBnB), enough to know what to expect from a room costing 123 $ CAD (plus fees) in Hollywood. We did not expect the Ritz, but we will not accept paying that for a room in a dirty apartment that felt like a bad youth hostel.
We also had the following problems communicating with Alex:
	Alex made me repeat a lot of information before we arrived, while I was in Venice. All that information was already in our AirBnB messages.
	I had to insist that he take our luggage on the morning of our arrival, as agreed, because he thought he might no longer be available!
	So Alex arranged a meeting to pick up our luggage, not in front of the apartment, but across the street, and it wasn't Alex who met us, but a lodger who had been woken up at the last minute, and was late.
	When we came back that night, we again had to meet across the street. He then gave us confusing information, and asked us to claim that we are family if anybody asked.
Alex did try to be courteous, and said he did not want us to be dissatisfied. He even made a brief attempt at tidying up the kitchen. But that did not fix anything.
We had to sleep there the first night, because we arrived at 7:45 PM (as Alex requested), which was too late to find any other accommodations at a reasonable price, though I searched for 3 hours. I did find something for the next 2 nights, but it cost more than my AirBnB booking. At such short notice, barely anything was available in Hollywood.
For all these reasons, and generally for false advertising, we demand a complete refund.
Attached you will find a few pictures. My travelling partner can corroborate my statement if necessary. 
On a final note, I don't think Alex even has the right to rent out his apartment, because he always refused to meet us in front of the building, never came in with us, and asked us to claim that we were family if asked. I have contacted his co-op board to find out.
Thank you for your attention and your cooperation.

N.B.  I believe the language barrier did not help our case.  So I translated my original letter from French to English as best.

But all we get after discussion is a flat no to refund.  Ashley C.a case manager, mentions cleanliness or misclassification only as arguments to disengage from further discussion on this topic.
But there is much more.  Obvious reasons for doing so even partially. 
Moreover, we read the conditions of cancellation and we understand that we should be to say the least paid off for the 3rd night, given that I cancelled on the spot, 1st night.
Thank you.

217,"This was our first time using AirBnb, since we have heard some good things about it. However, we only listened to those who had good things to say about AirBnb when everything went smoothly for them; we did not listen to how poor AirBnb's conflict resolution team works, and we lost a $1000 in the end on our trip. Long story short, my girlfriend and I arrived at our unit and there were literally gang fights going on right in front of our unit. This was a unit that was advertised as being in one of the ""safer areas"". There were just about under 100 gang members, all staring at once we stopped our car and slow approaching us - so we of course got out of there right away for our own safety. - we ultimately ended up having to book a hotel that costed more than our AirBnb unit. I called AirBnb, and they said it was a good thing I called them, and that all I have to do is provide a receipt for the hotel, and we will be reimbursed. However, they had to inspect the situation first, which was understandable. After about a week of going and forth through emailing, AirBnb only refunded ""half"" which is what the host's policy actually was (which ended up being 1/3 since they do not refund fees...which basically is something I could have received just by clicking Refund through the website - so this whole week of ""fair mediation"" was for nothing), and then stopped replying to my emails. Joan, the employee that was ""looking into the situation"" had a problem with the fact that I did not stop at the unit and ""document"" how they were fighting and about to smash through the glass of my car and pop my tires. Basically, they wanted me to risk my and my girlfriend's life to ""document"". Why would I lie about something like this? I ended up losing $1000, it is not like we just decided randomly to not stay at the unit. AirBnb has no problem taking a big chunk of service fees from the host and guests, but does not want to even fairly mediate the issue. On top of that, they stopped replying to my emails even though I was respectful, patient and professional the whole time. And, remember how I said that I will be reimbursed on my hotel fees as a result of this? Never heard about that again from them. I just wanted my money back for the unit I never used, i would have even been fine if they didn't pay the difference on the extra gas and additional hotel fees I had to pay - this is like buying a television from a WalMart, coming home to plug in and finding it to have dead pixels, and then WalMart refusing to take it back because there's no proof that it is a faulty device. Makes no sense. And this was our physical safety on the line. AirBnb does not care about that, just about the money. 

This is the last time I ever use AirBnb, and I will be sure to inform others of how AirBnb treats emergency situations like this, and wants its guests to put themselves in dangerous situations just so they can use the excuse ""sorry, you have no documentation"" so they can keep their service fee money.",1,“AirBnb Wanted Us to Risk Our Lives for a Refund”

You really need to do your homework before staying at an Air BnB.

223,"The absolute worst company I have ever been involved with!!They don't care about RENTERS at all. We booked a condo in Santa Monica and within 24 hours we realized that the address was not where we thought it was and indicated that to the host... she said she would credit us 100% if the unit got booked. She told us to cancel through airbnb as well...which btw only helps protect her (Allison) the host. By doing that it would be harder later we found out to get our money from our credit card company and it would have disrupted status of the host from ""SUPER HOST"". At some point I checked the dates and it showed that it was rented and they denied that it was for all of the days we had booked.....THEN WHY DID IT SHOW RENTED??? Mean while I researched the whole process of this company to see how it worked since the host had an extremely strict policy and was very unsympathetic. We were in dismay when we read on the airbnb website that the unit was illegal according to the Laws and Regulations for Santa Monica. It stated that vacation rentals are prohibited unless 30 days or longer. If a primary resident is not living on site throughout stay then it is prohibited for short term stay. I confirmed with the city of Santa Monica department. I then contacted the host with this information and wanted our full refund due to this law or we were going to report the unit. She then turned it around as though she was the victim and said she was going to sue us for blackmail.....REALLY!!!! She then said she would give our money back only if we signed legal documents stating we would not damage her reputation and who knows what else. We Never signed such a document. This was important because (she) Allison... is a realtor that lives in Florida all the while renting units in Santa Monica and all over LA. She blatantly lied on airbnb website and indicated that she lived in LA, had some bogus job there and a bogus picture was posted of herself. We contacted airbnb with this information and basically they said sorry.....we can't help you. REALLY???They will just let this kind of thing go on??? The host took all of her units off that was posted in the Santa Monica area but we still have not gotten the other half of our money back which is $800.00. She still has units in the LA area. We are on our third attempt with our credit card company to get money back. They recommended contacting Airbnb once again.This whole thing happened back in April and have spent wasted hours on the phone with airbnb with no refund!!! HOW IS THIS OKAY???? It has been such a waste of time. We are being assigned another ""manager"" now but I am not hopeful.Why should I be with the experience so far. STAY AWAY! Its not worth it if you have a issue!

I was ignored by Brenda and told I couldn't speak to a supervisor.

231,"This is a review of AirBNB customer service / agents who take your call and try to resolve issues that you might encounter with your stay.

THE BAD
1. TOTALLY UNRESPONSIVE in communication (you send them an email on Monday, they reply on Thursday, you call them 5 times on Tuesday, they just don't call back)
2. OVERPROMISE/UNDERDELIVER behaviour- a classic for unprofessional out-of-US agent centers (which here is not the case). They promise everything is going to be taken care off, just to take you off the phone. 
3. NO WILLING TO HELP attitude - they actually CANT DO ANYTHING. Its really pathetic. Whatever you ask them - there is some problem why they can't do this or can't do that. Feels like talking to an immigration officer, rather then service agent... Guys at DMV are 1,000 times better!!

So bottom line is - if you are expecting to resolve any kind of issue with Airbnb - try your luck somewhere else - i.e. try to first resolve everything with the host, because this guys are useless. 

In many years of international travel, dealing with hotels, airlines, any kind of agents - I must admit, I have never came across such a bad customer service agents as AirBNB, where the agents are actually - GENUINELY NOT INTERESTED to help you resolve a problem. Their job is to actually make your problems - ideally unsolvable.

we had to cancel our reservation due to some work related issues. before canceling we called host and explained her and asked if its ok to cancel the reservation at all. She was nice and explained us that her cancellation policy is moderate and we will not get Taxes and cleaning fees(around $60) back. and we will get some amount directly from Airbnb and some we'll have to request to her through. so we did exactly what she said.
we paid $282 total and at the time of cancellation we got $107 immediately from airbnb(as she told us) and we got the option to request $114 from the host(as she told us). but we never got the $114 back . she made so many stories that she really wants to give our refund but she never got any refund request from airbnb. and Airbnb people said the host isn't responding to their calls or emails and they cannot process refund without Host's confirmation.
So long story short after talking to her and airbnb for a week they got back to us saying that Host has refused to refund any amount and they can not do anything!!
we have all the emails and text messages from her and Airbnb but we never thought you can fraud people openly.

To add insult to injury, they never posted the 5 stars from my guest, which as a new host is vital to my business. Another call and another customer rep stated that she needed to speak with a ""special team"" before my stars could be displayed. Airbnb never apologized for the payment delay. As a household name, they are indifferent to the very people that make their business possible. It appears that 5 phone calls, multiple emails, a tweet and responsive action from the Better Business Bureau did the trick!

My house is great, it has been recently renewed but unfortunately Airbnb made it a disaster due to some crazy guests who just because they´re on holiday they believe they can break anything and do whatever. Well, every 2 or 3 months I have the bad luck of receiving some guests who break furniture and other objects in the flat. Although I charge 300 Euros deposit, I never see that money. The value of the broken objects in my flat since last year is over 1000 euros, but Airbnb never  responds to our complaints. I sent them bills and every possible proof with the broken items and they never assume responsability. There is a certain agent in charge with these cases, called Darragh who is the most unpolite, bad educated agent I have met in my life. They don´t even want to get to a negociation: for example I pay half of the damage, the guest pays half. No! So, I tell you people: booking through Airbnb can be a nightmare, but beeing an owner is even worse. It is not worth it because this company is not honest and doesn´t respect the customer. I only had 5 stars reviews in my profile and they refused paying me the damage made by a guest who had never rented on their webpage.

Airbnb deducted half of the her payment from my account, even when i wrote and called them that i am not accepting that. And the most funny thing is, they asked me if it is ok for the guest to move out by 9pm (they were saying that the guest is asking), i agreed, then later the guest said she didn't agree that. And the guest didn't move out by 9PM, as a matter of fact, i followed up with email and phone call again to ask Airbnb to take care of it, then finally the guest moved out around 10PM. I called and emailed them one more time that i will not accept the way they split the payment, they deduct that money from another payment anyway.
Then they emailed me saying that they will pay me $39 for making up the late move out of the guest, and guess what, later they paid $10 to my account.

The company has terrible protocol, and the operators are truly incompetent. Just dealt with their site, which is down due to matinance, for two days, and just before writing this, got off the phone with customer service. After being dragged through verifying who I was, even though all I asked was is the site down due to maintenance, the operator, Domenic, told me what I told him, the site was under matinance! He then began to use any excuse he could find, as to why it was my fault and not the websites. He would find something, like my Facebook not attached, or a CC that was expired, and blame that. I informed him, if he looked further into it, he would see that was not the problem. He would then proceed to railroad over me, and try a new excuse, which I would shoot down. In the end, he offered to help me delete my account!!! Wonderful help. So, I asked for a supervisor. This is where it got comical. Kathryn got on the phone and told me the site was down for a little while, but it should be back up, and that she hadnt seen a complaint other then mine today. Funny how I found this on a website I went to, when researching the problem:

when I booked, I've got message ""Unfortunately, a server error prevented your request from being completed. Airbnb may be undergoing maintenance or your connection may have timed out. Please try again."" or ""Were having trouble with the payment method youre trying to use. Please try another one.""
It happened over 24 hours.

Same problem Im having. Go figure, I know more about whats going on with AirBnB, than their own supervisors. In the end I asked her,  So, what your telling me is you cant help me, youre not offering any kind of compensation for my trouble, for the frustration of watching two properties I wanted get booked while I tried to complete the process of getting them, and having to call you, to get told the same thing I said first to the operator. That youre going to write tech, and I just have to wait, and keep trying, in the hope that the site works for me one day?. This is where it got golden. She informed me, that because I had gotten a $50 credit for starting a business account (a reward they give for doing so) that they could not give me anything for my troubles. Because of a credit that I earned, from a promo they offer!!! 

Never using this company it again. The app, trashed! Good-bye, and good luck with pushing away your customers.

Airbnb and the property owners must be laughing all the way to the bank, passing along fees to the customers like that.

I checked two days before departure to learn the host had cancelled my lodging without telling me. AirBNB did not alert me either. That is a product, infrastructure issue. I tried to book with another host who showed immediate confirmation. I discovered not only was that not a true confirmation, but that host had not owned that property for two years. Again, an infrastructure issue. No one is monitoring the lodgings and the hosts. PLUS there was no way to write a review on that host because the lodging was cancelled. 

Now let's get to customer service. They were useless. All they did is send me emails to dwellings I had already discarded. They would not offer more than a standard $200 to help with my booking which was for two weeks. $200 wouldn't even cover two days of any of the other residence. So, I could not afford any of the appropriate last minute lodging and Air would not help.

There was one host who had 7 appropriate lodgings. I asked Airbnb support to contact that person to see if any of her lodgings were available ASAP. I was about to depart. They said they would and two days later, they still had not come through. I was already in country staying in a hotel. 

My third week was to be in another country on the beach. The night before arrival, the host sent me an email saying the sand fleas were over abundant, bring bug spray. Don't lounge on the beach.There was limited and poor wifi, almost no taxi service and no restaurants in the area. I was supposed to taxi from the airport, go to a supermarket, then get to the lodging with all my cooking supplies for four days. I had to cancel but was financially penalized. Air would not intervene or even address the issue. I lost over $500. 

To make matters worse, any refunds took four contacts to initiate. The company needs to fix their software application to do the checks and balances on hosts and cancellations. The company needs humans to monitor and work with hosts to provide a standard level of service. The company needs to allow disappointed travelers to comment on hosts even if they don't stay at the lodging. But mostly, Air needs to monitor their hosts constantly and penalize those who damage their brand by misbehaving.",1,“Long list of why AirBNB International sucks”

That means you cannot coordinate check-ins, answer phone calls and questions which creates tremendous frustration with potential guests.

First of all, it is quite apparent that Airbnb does not have as much protection for it's guests compared with it's hosts who are it's source of income! Therefore, it cannot be a fair organization. My host was allowed to cancel my reservation on me after I had spent a lot time and money to select that property back in January. This was a shocking revelation to me that hosts can do such a thing even after payments are taken from my credit card. In my case, it was not even an emergency. It was just that another guest had offered my host a longer reservation (6 months) which conflicted with my booking. The host canceled my booking and took the other guests. Does this seem to be morally acceptable to you?

Secondly, Airbnb customer support was not there for 3 days when it was needed most to help me out! The person assigned to my case (Alex G.) was out of the office for 3 days and no one in the office would take care of her cases. Apparently, this is not Airbnb policy to reassign customer cases! While I was looking for another property to switch to, my repeated emails to Alex remained unanswered. When I called customer support line, I was told that I have to wait for Alex to return, and yet they would not tell me when she would come back to the office. How frustrating is that?

Thirdly, Airbnb does not really care about customer support. Why, you may ask? Well, here are a couple of good reasons:
1) There is no phone number to be found anywhere in Airbnb web page to contact customer support. I had to find it thru Google! If there is one in Airbnb web site, you have managed to hide it real well!
2) There is no obvious link in Airbnb web page to leave any feedback. I had to ask your customer support to get this hidden link. Don't you want to know what your customers think of your services? Why isn't there a clear feedback link right in your main page for people to provide feedback and rate your customer support? Note: This is not for the property. The feedback is for Airbnb itself.

I wonder if this feedback is going to bit bucket or if a real person is going to even read it. I am going to remain optimistic for a couple of days to see if anything results from this feedback.

I had to eat out that evening and is a problem for me because of my illness.

I reported this to Airbnb. Then the host sent a money request after I had checked out asking for full payment of £50 as he accused me of breaking the hot plate. I told him that I had tried to call him but he simply ignored any communication other than stressing for the money. He submitted a photo of the hot plate which showed no damage. Airbnb said that was enough evidence so ordered me to pay the host the money. Airbnb never even answered my complaint about the condition of the apartment.

Think twice before booking through Airbnb because it seems that they'll side with the host no matter what and you could be faced with a huge bill for something you never done. Be very careful. Overall very poor customer service and the system seems to be automated.

One night I had to park 1/2 mile away from the apartment.   The nights I had off, I would be up in my apartment reading or watching Netflix on my laptop and I would hear gun shots echoing off in the distance.   The nurses that I worked with educated me on the blue lights.  I had no idea what they were talking about.  Well, here in Salem if there is enough snow, you cannot park on the street because the streets are too narrow for the plows so you have to find someplace else to park. When the blue lights on the light poles flash, that's your warning that you cannot park on the streets or you will be towed.  One morning, I had the day off and there was some sort of event going on and the police were going around putting up no parking signs.  I had no place to move my car so I called airbnb, explained to them my issues.  They pretty much sided with the host because the description does say off street parking.   Shortly after I arrived, I noticed that the neighborhood looked real sketchy. I called the Salem police to ask about the neighborhood.   They said that I could not have picked a more dangerous area of the city.  That portion that I was in has the highest homicide rate, highest heroin use and highest breaking rate of the entire Salem, MA area.   I told Airbnb that too.  They did not say anything except they would reach out to the host.   I was able to get out of my contract BUT WITH A CATCH.  I agreed to pay $55/d for the full 35 days.  Since I checked out early,  I was charged the full $110/d to the tune of right at $2000.00 for 2 1/2 weeks of living in fear and terror for my life.    I've used airbnb in the past and have had a good experience.  I learned a very valuable lesson.  From now on, I'll call the police in the area that I plan to stay, and ask them what the neighborhood is like and is it safe for a single female to be walking from her car to the apartment/house and is the neighborhood safe to walk around during the day if you wanted to go for a walk.",1,“check with police before booking” 
290,"That's right. I had a tenant of mine run an AirBnB in Los Angeles from her apartment. Gave her warning to stop, but she insisted on continuing. NO HELP at all from the company to stop her ILLEGAL business in the apartment. We had to subpoena her AirBnB records for court.  After a substantial battle, we finally got the Sheriff to perform a lock out (conclusion of an eviction). She ended up signing a stipulation owing lots of back rent, since we could not collect during the eviction process. She may have saved some rent money, but now has an eviction that stays on 10 years (court record) and a collection on her credit report.  Good luck getting a loan or renting again with that.

Since I am terrified of mice, I moved the towel to show evidence to Host, and convinced myself that it wasn't what I thought...fast forward to later that night while we were relaxing watching tv in living room, a mouse made an appearance that freaked us out. 

I immediately contacted the Host who was apologetic, said property is exterminated every six (6) months, due to late hour husband would stop by in the morning to address problem, and host also contacted Airbnb customer service for guidance. Host claimed that guest has never seen or made a complaint regarding rodent(s), which might have been true, but hard to believe considering the dropping on towel.

After we determined that mouse had not taken shelter in leather sofa, we discovered an unused vent under a throw rug under said sofa was that contained an old radaitor beneath the floor. 

We purchased steel wool and glue traps from Walmart, covered vent with steel wool, placed the rug back over vent, and put glue traps under sofa and in other corners of living room.

We tried unsuccessfully to secure other accommodations but all hotels were booked and there were not any Airbnb properties available near-by that could accodate a party of ten. Airbnb sent me an email to inform me that if we located another property that was more than we paid for house with the mouse that we would receive a 10% discount, to explain how to rebook with funds paid, that host cancelled reservation returning funds, but since we were unable to secure other accommodations. We had no choice but to remain in house with the mouse.

305,"A ""Merry Christmas"" from Airbnb.  Please share this story and add any similar ones of your own.

In August I used Airbnb to book 9 night in a condominium for five people in Waikiki that was to begin on December 25.  I paid in August.  $4,657.00 paid in August.  We have used Airbnb for a few years because it usually takes two hotel rooms to hold five people.

We landed in Waikiki today.  The owner told me to contact ""Tonie.""    I never did understand who he was.  I exchanged text messages with Tonie.   He said he was cleaning another condo and would be a little late.  He said he also had to clean the place we were staying because another guest had just left.

We arrived at the condo at 3:50.  We waited on the street because we didn't know exactly where the place was.  Check in was supposed to be 3:00.

After about 15 minutes Tonie messaged me to say that a pipe had broken and we couldn't stay there.  I guess it is possible that a pipe broke between the previous guest leaving and our arriving.  It's possible, right?

Tonie and Sami from Airbnb contact me.  After a short conversation he explained that Airbnb would refund the $4,657 (no interest for the 4.5 months) and give me a $200 credit on a future Airbnb stay.  Although...I am not sure I'll want to risk it again.

Sami also said he would help us to find another place to stay in Waikiki and that if we couldn't find a comparable place we would get a $250-$300 credit for the night.  I'm not sure why there was a range on the credit...

Sami sent an email with four places for us to look at.  The previous place had been in Waikiki with two bedrooms and beds for five.  None of the places Sami sent were close to comparable.

I was able to find one (one!) hotel in Waikiki that would take five people.  For $849 per night (plus taxes).

I continued talking with Sami.  He explained that I would get the $250-$300 credit (why the range?) for one night.  After that they would help me to look on Airbnb again.  I explained that I did not want to spend my vacation looking for places to move to and being the prime holiday time in Waikiki there, at least as of now, are no comparable places in Waikiki over the next nine days.

Before passing final judgement I am waiting to hear from Airbnb.  If they refund my money (even without interest), give me the $200 credit, and pay for $300 per night this will be an ""Airbnb comes through and saves the day"" story.

If I end up paying the $4,000 extra myself I will have lost all faith in Airbnb.  I will be very disappointed that people looking to enjoy their vacation have to worry that if something goes wrong Airbnb does not care.

I will follow up after I hear from them again.",1,"“""Merry Christmas"" from Airbnb” "

The case manager seemed biased towards the host and used only host's argument to close the case in her favor based on inaccurate and unsubstantiated statement. Despite several emails and calls, I was not able to talk to a manager or supervisor to understand rationale behind decision. In my last attempt, customer representative even hanged-up on me without putting me through a supervisor to further explain my case and challenge decision.

310,"Air B&B is a total joke! I strongly suggest no one use it. We booked a house for $1500 for our family Disneyland trip and the pictures of the house made it look awesome but when we showed up we realized immediately they had falsely advertised the place. It was listed as being on Disneyland Drive but that is not where it was. It was in a bad part of town where there were bars on every window and the neighborhood was trashy and run down. That wasn't even that big of a deal. It was posted as a privately owned condo but it was a crappy apartment building. In the listing it stated it had a washer and dryer in the condo but it was a seperate laundry area for the whole apartment complex that you had to pay to use and stand there and wait for it to be done. The listing stated it had 2 car parking, but it did not. It had a small covered parking area that parked one car and it was so tiny our car didnt fit in it without us having to climb out the back hatch of the car. So we drove around looking for alternative parking and the nearest place we could park was 12 blocks away. Really? 12 blocks of walking with kids after walking all day at Disneyland.....I don't think so.  It said the house slept 10, but there was no possible way for that. The house was filthy. The walls were all scraped and scuffed and dirty, cobwebs everywhere, moldy shower curtain, drool stains on the pillows, dirty used bars of soap and loofahs in the drawers and showers, no light bulbs in any of the fixtures or lamps, clumps of hair in the sink and drawers, carpets hadn't been vaccumed, floors hadn't been swept, coffee had been spilled on the counters and was dripping down the cupboards, the fridge was disgusting and made a super loud buzzing noise, and the neighbors were loud and you could hear people running through the other units. It was gross and dirty and nothing like described. We left immediately and contacted Air B&B and booked 3 last minute hotel rooms which was expensive. We followed the rules to filing a claim and getting a refund on the website and they won't refund us. Seriously?!

319,"I guess one MORE one-star is not going to add to what is so obvious already - my recent experience in Iceland echoes everything others have said. I will add here that since I live in the Bay Area and found out that the HEADQUARTERS of Airbnb is in San Francisco at 888 Brannon - After numerous attempts at dealing with their so-called ""customer care"" with the same experience of other reviewers (being ignored or getting canned generic automated replies completely ignoring my well documented detailed complaints about the apartment owner's remise and RUDE treatment), I wrote a formal letter of complaint to their self appointed CEO, Brian Chesky.   As expected, it was ignored, so I followed up on-line with threats of going public and outside the organization with possible legal action since this company TAKES THE FULL AMOUNT due at BOOKING and then accepts NO responsibility or even gets involved when something goes wrong, which obviously happens a lot (read the reviews below!).

I believe this relatively new way of doing business on-line the way Airbnb does (with seemingly no procedures, policies or standards/requirements on the owners to assure locating their properties is as easy as possible and that things like appliances, stow-a-way beds, etc. are safe, in working order and instruction information is available or provided in person by owner) is  ""testing the waters"" in a number of ways.  

In my case, when I finally did get a response from a ""Senior Customer Service"" rep, it pretty much ignored my primary points and offered to do nothing regarding taking some responsibility and much needed corrective action.   I have since written back twice and all I got was another generic automated reply basically running me in circles!   AS MANY HAVE ALREADY EXPRESSED, THIS COMPANY IS A JOKE AND IT IS A CRIME THEY ARE GETTING AWAY WITH IT!

I have threatened to take the whole situation to local newsman, Michael Finny and his ""Seven on Your Side"", as I think that kind of exposure would perhaps GET THE CEO's attention and force him to get involved and make some changes!   Another more direct approach would be to get government and legal authorities involved regarding the issue of them collecting FULL rental amounts up front and then bowing out and leaving it up to the renters and owners to duke it out when things go wrong, which they obviously do!

Called today and the person I spoke to threatened to hang up on me I was not satisfied with her answer, again, ""someone is already looking into this case"" and has no idea about status. I asked and told her that I wish to speak to her supervisor, answer ""there is no supervisor""
Bottom line: I told the people I spoke with that this issue is not my problem. They approved the guest, their fees are collected lightingly fast and the mind boggling avalanche of data flow to your email, SMS, Airbnb App, as well as any other contact they have registered on you.

I didn't understand how I was doing ""social commentary"" but Ok ,Ill just redo it, taking away the contested parts and post.   Airbnb made it impossible for me to put an honest review online. Apparently a case manager is the only one who can change my account settings to allow the new review online. I called them constantly without being able to connect with the case manager assigned to us. I was sent an email from case manager that was not set up to respond to.!!  Finally after I made repeated calls  to get this online I was called by the case manager and told there was nothing she could do !!!saying 48 hours from the time of review!!  this was new information!!! Of course  time was up ! Also this all happened within the 14 day timeframe submitting reviews.  Last communication with airbnb was on 12th day.

333,"We booked and confirmed for a 2BR in midtown Vancouver (1028 Barclay Street) 4 months in advance. All fine except the host told us she did not have ""front desk"" priveleges and access would be via the side entrance. Mmmmmmm. Hosts name was Ashleigh P.

A few weeks before leaving for Vancouver I noticed her listing had disappeared from Airbnb. I messaged her and she said she had had to take it down. Too many requests. Mmmmmmm. She replied using the name Nicole P.

One week before leaving for Vancouver I contacted Airbnb to discuss my rising doubts. I was told there was no need to worry. They were confident all was above board. Mmmmmmm. Why were they so dismissive?

5 days before arriving I get a message reminding me she had no ""contract"" with the management at her condo for concierge services so she would meet me personally to let me in and show me around. Mmmmmm.

0830 on the morning of the booking I am boarding a plane to fly to Vancouver and I get a text saying to meet her at an address 38 Smithe Street Vancouver. Mmmmmmmm. WHAT?

I called Nicole/Ashleigh and she tells me she cannot now provide the promised apartment as her access pass had been blocked but she has ""moved us"" to a 1BR in a different area of town. She is ""not prepared to explain or argue with you about this"". The booking is changed and she has no obligation to do more.

What transpired is that she was (sub) letting an apartment illegally in a building and that the owner/building management had blocked her access. She had been doing it successfully for some time and had good reviews but now was caught out and barred. Obviously the assurance she had given Airbnb was falsified. When I raised this with Airbnb they said ""we have hundreds of thousands of hosts. We can't verify all their claims"". 

Airbnb cancelled the booking and said they would find another apartment in tge same area and standard. We trusted them as we were just a few hours from arriving. we are a 35 minute bus ride from mid town, on a very busy highway and with only a gas station anywhere bear to shop. Our holiday is completely ruined. The Airbnb ""service"" person took us for mugs.

What is my complaint? Airbnb say Nicole told them she had a last minute hiccup and they accepted her excuse completely even though they know she gave us a completely different excuse. They agreed it was unacceptable but they had absolutely no plan to do anything other than help me find alternative accomodation: she was a successful host (aka she made big $ for Airbnb). I was told this really did not happen often and I was unlucky. I was told 4 times that Airbnb took great care to look after their customers and that my experience was unusual. I was left to understand that I should feel for the host and just get on with it.

The bottom line is that Airbnb will keep Nicole/Ashleigh. They said so. She is a valuable source of income to them. They understand what has happened looks dodgy but if she tells them she is OK to offer an apartment then they will take her word for it. And if she gives a blatantly false explanation to cancel, who is Airbnb to confront her?

Airbnb's model is set up to facilitate scamming and they know that and believe that they can ""manage"" victims when they emerge. It's a buyer beware portal. 

So BEWARE.

I wanted to find an accommodation with 3 bedrooms so that my son and his wife and my daughter and husband and my wife and I could be under one roof.  I had a good experience with Airbnb in September 2015, so I got on the site.  I located a 3 bedroom suite at Mar Vista Resort in Myrtle Beach and I reserved the suite with my credit card for July 15  18, 2016. 
As of the 1st of June 2016, Id heard nothing from the host Sean Michael (VAWAY).  I sent a message to Airbnb and later I received a short message from Sean stating that everything was okay and I would get check-in instructions soon. 
During the week of our trip, I sent a message every day to the host, Sean Michael and he gave me the same response, the check-in information is coming.  On Thursday, the day before leaving, I pressed the issue and got Tonya, CSR Manager of Airbnb involved. 
Finally, I got a call from Sean Michael and he informed me that the property at the Mar Vista resort had been double booked.  If the property was double booked, how did I get pushed out and the other person was given the suite at Mar Vista.  So, Sean Michael offered me a 2 bedroom suite in Cherry Grove.  We needed 3 bedrooms not 2 so this would not work for us.  Then he said, my party would have to leave to a larger five bedroom suite in Cherry Grove for the next two nights.  I did not like his proposal so I contacted Airbnb again.  I later got a call from Sean Michael and he was upset and suggested that it was my fault that I did not have a place to stay in Myrtle Beach.
Soon it was obvious that we would not get help from Sean Michael or Airbnb.  So, we had no choice but to search on our own to find a place.   Finally, we found 3 separate rooms at Embassy Suites which increased my cost by over $2,000 because of last minute planning and searching for a room.

- Reviews are unreliable, they are only published if both parties make a review so if either party suspects they will get a bad review they simply don't make one.

- In Ecuador, where we host, permission must be obtained from the local authorities to rent or offer hospitality, which means they must adhere to certain standards and pay yearly fees and taxes and are accountable if guests have any complaints. 
Airbnb take no responsibility to ensure their listings are legal and continue to list properties that have been reported as illegal all over Ecuador, these properties are mostly run by expat retirees looking for a little extra income. In the meantime, due to the enormous success of Airbnb they are putting local legitimate business's out of business

- Their cancellation policies are ineffective, as a small business we rely upon and work hard to keep our rentals occupied and consequently chose a strict cancellation policy, yet our guests were able to cancel their reservation ONE DAY before the start of the second month of their reservation and even though the house was left like a pig-sty and things were stolen we were unable to give a review because the reservation was cancelled!

While we have loved many wonderful hosts and delighted in hosting guests, we have stopped using airbnbn in favour of booking.com due to airbnbs unethical management. You need to be aware that by using airbnb you're supporting a company who:
1. Has an arbitrary review process. We wrote a review of a nightmare host who had positive feedback. Our review didnt appear, we had to manually check for it. We had to contact Airbnb to ask why. They said that they should have emailed us, and when it turned out they failed to, they investigated why our review wasnt published. Turns out the host had objected, and Airbnb had published her review on us, but not ours on her due to a technicality (we pasted a text message our host had sent us). We were happy to revise our review by simply removing the pasted phrase. Airbnb wouldnt allow this. I dont know of any serious site that conducts such a one-sided arbitrary (and faulty) review process. This was highly likely the reason our nightmare airbnb host's feedback didn't feature anything negative - she uses airbnbs arbitrary feedback process to block reviews. So you can't trust reviews on airbnb.

2. airbnb see nothing wrong with renting out properties that have been stolen. Yes, you read that right: stolen. Check out the campaign on sumofus and other sites. Airbnb will rent you property that by international UN law have been stolen in Palestine.

Airbnb has an employee call us who, however, has absolutely no sense of urgency about the situation, suggests we find another listing, does not offer to help at all until I start screaming, I asked that they put us up in a hotel, they said of course they would not and I had to find two rooms just for one night (they were unavailable as the following day), where we all crammed together to give airbnb and ourselves time to find a replacement apartment. But there are only a couple of places within specs in Manhattan, one turned out unavailable, the other's owner would not respond, and in the meantime I could not start my vacation, waiting to fix the situation. After thinking it over we decided that we had better find a hotel somewhere, anywhere, even at double the price we would be paying for the apartment otherwise we would have wasted all the expenses and time off for the vacation we had planned months in advance. We felt completely ambandoned by Airbnb throughout this whole process, and the fact that they kept sending template apology messages does not cut it, quite honestly. So, no, will not trust them ever again and considering seriously claiming for the considerable costs we suffered.",1,“Stay away!”

He had a place, not in the area we would have liked, but being thousands of miles away, we had little choice. So the deal was set, we thought. We advised Burak that our plane would be arriving at JFK at 5:30 PM and we would meet him at the apartment at about 7:30 to pick up the key. He said that would be impossible because the key could only be obtained between 1 and 5.  We tried to explain that our plane would not even be on the ground then. He could not alter the rules. We called Airbnb but they told us Burak was the person with whom we had to deal. As a matter of fact, an Airbnb agent hung up on us.

The facts are as follows : The landlord can cancel the deal at any time and the only commitment Airbnb has is to give you back your money for the rental that you had already paid 100% in advance and there is no compensation for the time ( may be weeks or months) that they have your money for free and for the trouble they cause you like having to star over looking for an apartment or worse as in my case having started my trip and getting notice on the way that my rental in Lima -Perú-that I had already paid for was cancelled and I had nowhere to stay . If the tenant cancels the deal damages to the owner on an unknown arbitrary bases will be established but if the owner cancels the deal no damages are considered .

404,"My husband, 15-year-old granddaughter and myself had planned a trip to Europe in May/June. 
On March  >>>>  the US State Department declared a Traveler Warning for Europe, specifying that terrorists were targeting US citizens overseas, further stating that mass transit and tourist sites were likely to be the areas attacked. For the State Dept. to issue such an alert (with specifics) the state dept. must certainly have gathered enough information to deem travel dangerous for US citizens.
Therefore, we felt we must cancel, especially since we were traveling with our granddaughter. We had made reservations in 5 Airbnb places. We were required to pay in full, and four of the five owners would only give a 50% refund no matter the circumstances. Airbnb service charges ranged from $32-78 per reservation, which added up to a total for the 5 reservations at $272, all nonrefundable. The total we lost from the owners added up to $1,116, for a grand total of $1,388.
We cancelled on 3/25/16 and our arrivals dates were 5/31, 6/3, 6/7, 6/10, and 6/13, leaving the owners 10.5 to 13 weeks to rebook. 
Despite what they advertise, there was no way to communicate with any one at Airbnb, as I tried for an entire afternoon.

Apparently, the guests that stayed in condo before us burgled the other condos in the unit.  Nice.  Needless to say, there was nothing even close to what we had booked still available the day before we were to arrive.  I realize this is a first-world problem, but these trips mean a lot to us as a family.  I also realize that sometimes things do come up that truly are beyond people's control.  However, I also expect people to make some sort of effort to make things right when these things do happen.  The owner's response?  ""You can go to the airbnb site to find another listing.  Sorry.""  We tried to email him and did not hear back until 7 that night.  Airbnb contacted us a 9:30 that night saying they will get us our money back within 5 business days, but they would give us a coupon for $100 off our next airbnb stay.

The strict cancellation policy should be re-defined to state that cancellations made prior to 6 months in advance will receive 100 percent refund--not 50 percent.

As for the bnb itself Do NOT host for them unless if you have your landlord written agreement or you have HOA approval, lack of it you can get fine big time if you own and evict if you rent and once you get eviction in your credit you won't be able to get a place anywhere as it live in your credit for 10 years and bnb can't be anymore careless because they use hosts.

Also they have a total bias toward guests and have a department call trust and safety that never answer calls, they refuse to call, impose only to write and they write copy cat emails, almost like a robot. They never answer specific questions. The worse is, they don't have any departments above them, no manager nothing. I have hosted 40 of their guests and have 5 stars reviews all around and was called a superhost, all it took one lie form one guest who had no review and was a first time user, and they give full refund to the  guest  without my approval or even courtesy of email, even I have text from her who thanks me and she was happy and I'm the best, but one of those who go to store buy things use and then return to fetch refund and Airbnb never argue and always refund because they make the host pay and they just deduct it from my next booking. You can call and complain the neighbor make noise, the place didn't had tub and only shower or any lame excuse and they refund.all you need as a host to fall in one dishonest guest, bnb is with them at %100

If guest break or steal anything, as a host you are on your own. Basically they alway side with guest and abuse hosts.  I stop hosting for them because I don't like their bias and lack of appreciation. But it's good to be guest because you can just go like that guest did to me sleep three nights for free and call and make up any lies and they refund you. So to hell with free rides and bnb.

Second, if guests cancel even after they check in and use your property spending there a few days with their dog, they may cancel any time if they find an excuse and you will lose all your money for the exception of the few days they stayed at the property. 

I accepted 3 month reservation. My guest canceled because he found a cheaper place. He claim the property was not clean. I scrubbed it for 8 hours myself to be sure it is spottles.  AirBnB cancelled my reservation and I lost 2 month and 25 days of rent. I turned down all my other prospective clients in order to accommodate this guest. Accept AirBnB reservation ONLY if you have no other choices and this is your last resort. Also, you don't get deposit if property is damaged. Don't count to recover any of the deposit. I had a group of people smoking pot at the property. It was devastating. My cleaning lady texted me that it was so bad, she could not clean there without all doors and windows open. We had to cancel next guests reservation because they were a family with small children. AirBnB gave us $20 for air freshener after a lengthy dispute. 
Third, AirBnB charges hosts a processing fee of 3 to 4 % or higher depending on the transaction. They also charges guests a ""service"" fee.

FOR GUESTS: AirBnB charges outrageous guests fee. If you cancel you will not get your service fee back. Customer service is horrible. They used to be better when they were starting up. Now they are bigger than Choice Hotel Chain. I wonder if they go public as a company..",1,“STAY AWAY from AIRBNB: A Comment For Property Owners”

Recently, I was looking for a place specifically in Scottsdale. I ended up 25 miles away on the other side of PHX. OK. I could have looked closer at the map, however I would still consider this a ""bait and switch"" tactic. 
There's no direct way to speak to the owners prior to renting. It feels creepy and espionage like. Only through texts in which the phone number changes each text. It's hard to get a feel of a place or the owner without speaking at times.
Airbnb asked for your social security number in order to become a member. This is way out of line in this day and age. They aren't a bank or any other financial institution. 

The apartment was advertised for $65/night. I ended up shelling out $93/night. More bait and switch.
It was hardly worth the $65.

Not even 5 Minutes later I received confirmation of charges from my bank through text and email, however upon viewing my AIRBNB profile, there was no confirmation, no trip showing, or any other way to tell my reservation was made, aside from the charges to my card. Chatting and calling customer service got me no where in life  but aggravated and impatient since apparently the reps could not find my trip either, but magically had the last 4 of my card  number that was used on file, announcing it was a glitch/ one-off in there system and the charges are not normally applied until the host confirms. CSR Ricardo Barros emailed a statement informing of the error, as well as confirming to me that my refund had already been processed in full. Sounds lovely right? Seems like a rep will tell you anything just to get you off the line so it can be the next man's problem.  5 days later I am still not showing my refund released. I called to follow up and the next delusional rep said that AirBNB never processed it and I would have to log in to my trips to cancel. Now Obviously this bone-head did not do her due diligence to thoroughly read her notes for an IRATE customer because the trip not showing up in my profile is my reason for cancellation in the first place!

427,"We booked a house in a small province of Turkey with airbnb, thinking we could get away from the mess of the big city. 
We arrived at the house, and although we were a bit disappointed about the quality of the house compared to the price we paid (it amounted to the full month in a house like that- I checked afterwards), we left the place a bit relaxed after our visits to nearby villages and natural sites. 
The nightmare started as we got back. Although it hasn't been resolved yet, we are facing a damage claim by our host, 1600 Turkish Liras ( 500ish dollars) for burnt rugs and couches, broken tiles and old electrical heating devices that apparently did not work. 
We did none of the damage, the couches and the rugs were placed in front of the fireplace so we didn't think the burnt spots on them could be used against us. The host explained to us on the phone that the tile was broken already, and the electrical heating devices were so old and did not work, which meant we didn't even touch them after an initial try. 
These are issues with the host, it is obvious that she is after money and is trying to make us renovate her rugged apartment. 
The problem with airbnb is that, there is nothing we can do if they decide that she is right... I am not sure if the pictures of devices that seem to be off, and couches that are burnt, are enough evidence to prove we are the ones that caused them. But airbnb has no limit in the amount the hosts can charge, and we are apparently obliged to pay if the airbnb decides we have to. 
I am not sure how this can be overcome? Are we supposed to take pictures as soon as we arrive of every broken thing in a village house that is filled with broken things and burnt spots? What sort of proof could we have? Isn't the host responsible to prove to airbnb that we are the ones who caused the damage, instead of just proving the damage? 
Can I simply enlist in airbnb and make my future guests fix the broken things in my apartment?

The guests also consistently either lied or did not know how to use the Airbnb website, and would consistently put down fewer guests than actually stayed at my cabin. The DAMAGE CLAIM process is a JOKE! It is almost not worth it, as I yet to have a guest, even for a measly $50 say ""yes, we did ruin your bed sheet, and will pay you the $50."" Everyone of them are in denial, and just want to say they did not do it, instead of being honest. Customer Service is a JOKE. I STRONGLY suggest paying more and using VRBO/HOmeaway, as I have never had one bad guest, have never made one damage claim, and customer service is GREAT!

A single male would register for the studio, then I would hear two people in the studio (I was in another room in the same building) and two people in the bathroom, etc. Because I charged more for each additional guest because of the utilities I had to pay in the studio (water, etc.) this was a blatant ripoff. The original guest does the initial meet & greet then later let's in their girlfriend, etc.

The worst was when a ripoff couple invited at least 6 other people to stay for free, so I had 8 people in my studio and 8 people using my shower. Getting paid for one. When I confronted them and demanded being paid for 8 guests, they called the police! Who showed up and screamed at me! These parasites know what they are doing. 

Single males would expect sex! 

And Airbnb rates hosts on how many times they host whatever low lifes they send. This does NOT happen to males, it happens to female hosts.

Another couple showed up to sell illegal drugs out of my home (happens all the time, dealers don't want to use their own homes to sell drugs out of, so they use female host's homes to do it). They travel into Seattle to make drug sales. Airbnb did not care, as long as they get the money. So dangerous armed drug dealers in your home. 

Then Airbnb reduces the ""rating"" of the female host, if she refuses or kicks out drug dealers!
They do not screen people looking to stay, and they offer ZERO protection for female hosts. None. If you are attacked they still expect you to host.

I wrote the three MALE owners of Airbnb to protest this abusive drug and sex trafficing site. No response, they are millionaires and why would they care if you are raped or completely ripped off. 

Airbnb is a rape culture and drug dealing facilitating site. It needs to be shut down.",1,“RUN RUN RUN from opening your home via Airbnb” 
435,"When I first became a host for Airbnb I like to service I like the fact that I could decline any guest I did not feel comfortable with .
 Over the years their policies have changed so much that now if I decline too many inquiries even though they are people who are clearly not bothering to read the description rules and policies of my property they punish me for it by reducing my standings or even a listing my bed and breakfast altogether .
 Their customer service consists of the reiterating our policies and telling me why they cannot change them .
 I had had much better experiences with Home Away and flip key ,  as well as a VRBO
The only thing that Airbnb seems to worry about at this point in their business is making lots of money from everyone no matter what even if the guest cancels or if I have to cancel in any circumstances they always keep their share of the money for the reservation Airbnb never refunds their service fee to the guest!!!
 If I have to cancel an inquiry because clearly the guest will not be happy in my place since they did not read the description Airbnb penalizes me and refuses to cancel the guest themselves all they are looking for is there money 
 I honestly feel that they do not care about me as a host.
  Oh and by the way I have received a super host designation from Airbnb I own a legitimate licensed bed-and-breakfast and I go out of my way to make sure that all of my guests have a superior experience here at my property ,  that said I would encourage everyone to try to book on VRBO or trip advisor's flip key first use Airbnb as a last resort",1,“I have been a host for Airbnb for three years.” 
436,"I booked an apartment in Dallas Texas

Not happy that over $300 was kept by air b n b and they were not concerned about it.  I notified them within 30 minutes of leaving the apartment when I called kyle(the host) he said well I thought apartment was cleaned 
Lesson to all make sure place has many reviews if you are to even consider booking with this company",1,“Stay at a hotel” 
437,"If there were an option for no stars, I'd have chosen that. Worst experience with accommodations I have ever had. The person (billing himself as Tony&Eli) that advertised the place, completely misrepresented the apartment. From the pictures I received from my daughter it seems as though it's not even the same apartment that was advertised. I was paying the rent there for a month so she could have enough time to find a place of her own, near to where she wants to go to school. 
After driving all night from Georgia (and the night before from Virginia) my daughter arrived there only to have to pack up and go stay with family. It was filthy and moldy. She took pictures and sent them to me and took them to my mother as well. Unfortunately she can't stay with family for long as she has a pet and my mother is allergic.
The next day he offered to put her in another apartment but I advised her not to trust that person, to have no more contact with him and to see if the family could help her find something else as she is just moving to Florida to go to school there. Instead of the person just letting it go, he refuses to refund the money and I've had to take it up with my credit card. It seems as if he has more than one place and probably is using the same pictures for all the ones he rents. Even though I tried to contact Tony&Eli by both my personal and work email, and sent him all the pictures of the apartment, he did not reply. Instead he kept trying to contact my daughter and convince her that she should move into some different apartment he had and to call a member of his family since he lives overseas currently. I did not want him harassing her as she's only 18 and hasn't had to deal with this sort of thing before.
AirBnb has been no help at all and is considering it a cancellation.Unfortunately, they also went through my daughter and did not contact me. Even though  the airbnb person is in California and can only see the pictures on line they think that just because the owner offers some other place that should be ok with the renter. I don't see why a customer should have to continue to do business with someone that has bait and switch tactics and would pawn off such a place on some kid.
I will never use airbnb again and I advise anyone who does to, if possible, check out the place in person and don't rely on airbnb to help if something goes wrong. I would especially not send anyone that is inexperienced to possibly have to handle a situation such as this. They will be better off going to an Extended Stay America or Homewood Suites where the management is accountable.
If anyone is interested in more details or seeing the pictures I am more than happy to share them. Just PM me.
Their response was the following:

John, Nov 18, 19:19:
Hello,
I did get your pictures and a majority of it looks like it can be scrubbed clean. I want to go through all the pictures you sent and the concerns.
I am not sure how the door frame can be fixed, it doesn't look broken but old and repainted. A lot of building and homes in Miami are older but it isn't broken.
The broken tile can be fixed and is something I can request the host have fixed while you are there if you stay. The A/C filter can be cleaned out but I agree is gross.
The floor wall boards can be wiped and the floor better swept. Can you please send me a picture of a bug if possible and a closer picture of the tile mold.
I can't tell if it is tile grout or if it is mold on the tile, either way I agree it does need to me scrubbed and mopped.
The cabinets can be bleached but look like they have water damage from years of dishes being put away and not all the way dry.
Last is the bathtub, it looks like an old tub and similar to mine. Since my building is from the 1980s the tub will get old an impossible to get all the soap scum.
It is something that can be scrubbed but not perfectly, possible cleaned with comet powder or bleached also to get rid of some stains and soap scum.
Overall I don't thank anything is bad enough for an immediate cancellation and I also need a picture to consider a vermin issue.
I appreciate your patience and hope you get a good sleep tonight, I am sorry for this issue but want to make sure I make the best decision.

Apparently scamming college kids is a business practice according to some other reviews I've read. Why anyone would be forced to live in this situation, or continue to have to do business with someone that scammed them in the first place is beyond me. Especially, when the apartment was about $1650 a month plus a pet fee of a $150. Now they are simply ignoring the problem. I have made a complaint with BBB we'll see if that helps

Update: Magically after contacting BBB they returned the money. (even though they previously denied any wrongdoing to the credit card company and had refused to refund it) However, they still sent on a message to my daughter trying to say that it wasn't really their fault. One thing that was interesting was that the owner of the place is not allowed to substitute another place without the agreement of the renter so he should have returned it immediately. Then they offered her a $75 gift certificated for another stay which we will not be using. The Florida Attorney General's office did send a letter just last week, after the fact that they would look into it and they also had suggested contacting the California Attorney General's office but as it's taken care of, there is no need.",1,“Stay at a hotel or extended stay hotel”

When I tried to ask for help with this, I got no response to my email and ultimately my booking was cancelled.

After entering the former information I was asked to submit my complete credit card info, okay, time to pay, I entered this thinking that I must be done.  NO-- next is a screen stating the need for access to either my Facebook or Gmail account AND allowing them to use all of my contacts. After much effort I was able to find a way to communicate with someone at Airb&b, thinking there must be  mistake, anyone can see that this is unreasonable. Nope, without either of the latter, I can't rent from them. I am amazed that a company do this.

When I again explained the cancellation refund already processed has not been received the consultant kept talking over the top of me, raised their voice until they wished me a good day and hung up. It was awful and made me feel like I had done something wrong, which I hadn't. awful exoerience and terrible service.",1,“They don't listen” 
445,"Here's my airbnb horror story. For a year I used airbnb for almost all my lodgings, more than 30 nights total. I was very satisfied with every host and accommodation, with a few minor issues that always got resolved between me and the hosts. Everybody happy. 

So I had 5 upcoming reservations with airbnb, and a week or so before the first one, I get an email from airbnb that I need to be ""verified"" or my reservations would be cancelled. I'm an old dude (64) and don't do facebook, which is apparently the preferred verification method, but I followed the instructions for verification by webcam photo of my driver's license, and the airbnb screen said it had worked, so I forgot about it.

Four days before my first reservation, I checked my airbnb account and ALL my trips had been cancelled!! I called airbnb after I googled their phone number (it was nowhere to be found on the airbnb website).  The call center guy said he could see the problem but he would have to call special forces to fix it, then assured me it would be done within 24 hours and everything fixed. Three days later, after 3 more calls and 3 more call center flunkies with the same  script, I gave up and told the last one to just let the cancellations stand. I ate the plane tickets.

I still have not heard a word from airbnb. No courtesy calls, no courtesy. Zilch. I would frankly recommend to anyone considering using airbnb that it may look like a good deal, but you get less than you paid for, and just pray there's no trouble because customer service is an insult and a sham.",1,“Hung out to dry” 
446,"I chatted an Airbnb rep to find out why guests could not reserve my listing after I canceled on a guest for that particular weekend. (I now know, of course, that is your punishment for canceling.) My issue was that I put my ad live but forgot to set certain dates (Mardi Gras weekend; I am in New Orleans) at higher rates. Almost instantly, someone booked the Friday and Saturday of Mardi Gras at the regular rate. So basically, I was a brand new user and made a mistake and was hoping Airbnb would at least allow me to list the place for Mardi Gras weekend, to that same user at the correct rate, or to someone else.

The conversation was pretty brief, but she did take the opportunity to lecture me on business ethics:

Kat: Airbnb has a policy of only wanting people who are serious about keeping reservations to agree.  We cannot bend the rules just to make money. Are you still with me?

Me: Yes I'm just trying to figure out how they hired such an unfriendly person to be a customer service agent. 

Kat: I'm friendly enough sir, you just don't like the answer.

Kat: We cannot waive the penalties in this case because the pricing was not what you wanted. It's not fair to the guests you cancelled on.

Not fair to the guests....what about not fair to me? It's fricken Mardi Gras weekend! If I had accidentally priced my place at $1.00 when I meant to price it at $100.00, would it be ""not fair"" for the guest not to get the place for $1.00? It's called making a mistake, a**holes!

449,"Air bnb take the money from the guest and keep it for about 1 to 2 weeks after your guest has booked in.  I find this unacceptable, airbnb is taking the commissions and then still holding onto the money for up to 3 to 6 months, if a guest books way in advance, now i have had 5 lots of guest come and go, and i have not had a payout from air bnb yet.  

How do we as hosts and guest know what the owners of airbnb are doing with our money, are they using it to play the stock market, having grand holidays with our money, and living the highlife until they overspend and go broke, i am not very trusting of this set up anymore, and they don't say anywhere what they do with this money?

450,"I almost never post nasty reviews on a service unless I am compelled to!  So this is one of those times where my review must be completely negative!  BEWARE of Airbnb!

The short version:  From start to finish, Airbnb's customer ""service"" team was extremely unhelpful, impossible to get a hold of, and I never got a consistent answer from their team.  The actual service they are providing (home rentals) is a good concept, but if something goes wrong and you actually need to speak with their team, you're hooped.  You will have no luck in getting any sort of help from them at all!  Their website is poorly designed, and it took at least five minutes to even find a contact phone number.  Want to speak to someone else?  Nope, no way to escalate any concern you have.  They definitely do NOT want to talk with you or help you; they have taken every measure to avoid that.  Even after you call, they want email communication onlybut those emails bounce back!!  STAY AWAY from Airbnb.

And it's only appropriate to share that owner/unit information here as well... Haim Kovos, MGM Hotel Signature.  He owns several properties that he rents out in the States.  Staying at his unit started all this nonsense.

So, the long version:  This started back in October and has still not been dealt with due to a number of issues from the side of their customer service team.  After a pretty horrid stay in a Las Vegas hotel/condo (lack of cleanliness, ill-equipped room, shady behaviour from the host, even resulting in me leaving three days early), the host offered us a small refund.  As the severity of the issue was pretty bad and I had been charged for the entire stay, close to $3000, I called Airbnb's team, and they said we could escalate it in the Resolution Centre after a period of time.  I thought, great, we can get them the info, our requested refund, and they will help us handle this.  Wrong!  After giving them a very detailed explanation of our concerns about the stay, the only measure Airbnb took was a single email to the host, having told us they had ""reached out.""  Again, when we followed up, they told us they never heard back from the host, and the issue was ""closed due to lack of response.""  That was it!  The case was ""dismissed"" and the ""decision was final.""  How the heck is it my fault that the host didn't respond, and now I don't get a refund or at the very least an explanation... or even be able to leave a review about the host of Airbnb!?  I was not able to leave a review on the host, as I left three days early, and even though I was charged for all those days, they started the 14-day cutoff for reviews on my day of departure!  Great for the host, just ignore it and you don't have to fix your issues or give a refund when it's due. Huh?

After a few more bounced emails, calls, and frustration, I got an email from Austin, a Supervisor.  So managers do exist!!  Since apparently we provided no photos, Airbnb can't issue a refund.  Not sure how I'm supposed to send photos of essential items missing from in the suite that I had to go and purchase.  I was NEVER told in the beginning I needed photo evidence.  I sent them every possible email and text information I had, did all that I could on my end to at least get a reply from their team other than ""sorry, you didn't send us exactly what we wanted within the stringent time frames we never told you about, and since the host hasn't gotten back to our one email, we can't help you anymore""!  

The really frustrating part is that there is only ONE email, and ONE phone number where they can be contacted.  Yet that email keeps bouncing back our responses, and I have to re-explain every time I call and I get nowhere.  What could have been a very simple solution has turned into a giant mess thanks to their extremely poor customer service.  Then I go to my ""open cases"" in the Resolution Centre a few days ago, and it still sits there ""open"" when they tell me it's been closed.  It's unbelievably frustrating.  No wonder they're rated 15% on www.sitejabber.com.

So in short, stay away from Airbnb, because if you have a problem, it won't get resolved.

465,"Airbnb has the right to withdraw the security funds if a claim for damages is submitted.  They don't tell you upfront that this is a negotiation process between you and the renter and the renter has the option to refuse the amount, offer their own amount.  If you don't agree to the amount, which there is no incentive for the renter to agree to your claim, you can ask Airbnb to be the decision maker.  We did this and were ""awarded"" an amount 25% less than our claim!  Even with receipts and invoice of the cost to repair the damage, we were not rewarded the full amount.  Homeowners beware, if you have damage to your place, you WILL NOT be covered for the full amount.

467,"We've booked several places with Airbnb as we travel around Australia, some have been good, some bad and some downright ugly. The good speak for themselves....but if you are unlucky enough to turn up to one place like we did which was filthy, then dealing with the host and the customer service can be a nightmare. In our case, the whole apartment was filthy, so much so, we did not want to stay the night. It would have taken an army of cleaners to fix this, but apparently you are supposed to give the host time to do so before you ask for a refund. Our host got particularly snarky and in the end we left it to Airbnb to negotiate a refund for the 3 days we booked. Luckily, we had photos to prove a point. Anyway, we didn't get all of it back but at least some was refunded. As others have said, Airbnb make sure they cancel your booking and then you cannot write a review, warning others. Bad practice.
The second gripe I have with Airbnb is that we chose a place and asked to book for 10 nights. On the advertised page, it stated the night rate was $111 per night and for a week $700. They add on a cleaning fee of $50 plus $119 booking fee. When we were quoted, the price came out much higher than the total we anticipated. We queried this with the owner, who explained it was Airbnb pricing policy and we were charged more because the rates are higher in December. There was no info on the webpage to that effect. She accepted our booking so we were unable to cancel, so we asked why she wouldn't honour the $700 a week fee? She offered $50 by way of resolving the issue. My point being (and I took this up with Airbnb customer service) is that if a price is stated on the page advertising the cost at $700 that should be the price you pay. There is no mention of 'hidden extras'....but apparently according to Airbnb, the host can decide what they will charge and you have to suck it up, or not....but try getting out of a booking! Most other sites are transparent and you can see the daily, weekly or seasonal rate before booking....with Airbnb you cannot. Be warned....this site is not very user friendly. When things are good, then you might enjoy the experience, but on the whole, when things go bad, it can get damn ugly!",1,"“The Good, The Bad and The Ugly” "

478,"Awful.  You can't speak to a real person at Airbnb.  They don't know how to run a company.  They don't even know the definition of an ""owner"".  Be careful landlords -- your goofy tenants are putting you at risk -- make your lease air-tight, and pay attention.  Be careful ""guests"" if you are renting from a tenant and not a an actual property owner, you are renting from someone who has no insurance, no legal ability to rent to you.  This business model is a mess.  I have been on both sides of the transactions as both owner and a guest (legally known as landlord and tenant) using all of these: Airbnb, Homeaway and Craiglist -- my experiences with the other parties and the spaces have all been good (but I also am a mature experienced person who knows how to know what is actually legit), however Airbnb is without a doubt so super weird -- this company has little to no customer communication and they pretty much disappear if an issue needs resolution -- super slow to respond and not helpful in the end.  And there are no leases or contracts (Homeaway encourages actual rental agreements, and so will most real owners -- even for short term).  The kindergarteners at Airbnb got lucky with a good idea (there are some good elements to the concept -- I won't get into outlining them here), but they haven't a clue how to run a business at all.  There is a lot of liability involved in the rental business, so be careful everyone.  Expedia needs to buy Airbnb and clean up the mess.  When your are established an publicly traded, you can't get away with just setting up a ridiculous illegal cult that exploits other people's private property and call it a business.   Airbnb is temporarily getting away with it, but that is only because urban bureaucracies have unwieldy regulations that confuse the very people who are supposed to enforce them.",1,“Just terrible.

We had to get another person to sign up and book it in their name, which was accepted.

510,"Adam, who met us at the flat, was very welcoming. The flat is lovely in a great neighborhood. The balcony is larger than the flat and you can see the top of Notre Dame from there.

Upon a closer look, we were quite disappointed with the following discoveries:

There was a water leak from an air vent over the toilet. Water was accumulating on the floor. We didn't want to take our time to continually mop the floor or have water drip on us while we sat on the toilet. I believe I fixed the leak by turning off what seemed to be an a/c unit. Adam explained that the leak was from all the rain before we arrived. It rained every day we were there and it didn't leak again.

Upon arrival, we put in a good bit of effort cleaning the floors. It looked like they hadn't been vacuumed in quite a while. The long black hairs, dust and dirt in the bathroom alone was disgusting. We swept and vacuumed all of the floors. Hair and dust were throughout the apartment.  It was probably the long black hairs that caused the shower drain to clog. We could only run the shower for a minute or two, then let it drain. The last night we were there, it clogged entirely.

There were wet bed linens in the dryer, so we attempted to dry and fold them. The dryer doesn't dry clothes. After several cycles, we hung our clothes in the flat to dry. Adam explained how to use it. We followed his directions. The dryer simply doesn't dry clothes well.

There was no trash can in the bath, so we used the bucket holding cleaning supplies located under the kitchen sink. 

The toilet had soap in it, but was not cleaned. It looked as though the cleaning person left early.

My wife took one short, warm shower before the hot water was gone. My first shower after flying from Atlanta, GA was ice cold. When Adam came by to address the issues we found, he explained the water heater was on a timer. He didn't know what settings were used. Obviously it was a setting that doesn't allow much hot water. He changed the setting to continuous and seemed to imply he was doing us a favor.

The water pressure was barely a drip. Upon checkout, Adam told us a new shower head was coming.

There was supposed to be a book of information about the flat and things to do in the area that wasn't supplied until we'd been there a couple of days.

Such problems are surprising given the other reviews for her rentals. There were no reviews for this rental. After a long day of traveling, we do not expect to spend our time cleaning a flat, doing laundry or taking a cold shower. 

We asked for compensation for our troubles since the flat was paid for in full before we arrived. The last email we received said Veronique would get back to us about that. Haven't heard from her.  Veronique was great about answering our initial questions before we paid for the flat. Adam was on time to meet us and was very friendly. Overall, the customer service we received was sketchy at best. We checked in on a Saturday. Once we noticed the problems, we called, texted and emailed the emergency number provided, but didn't hear from them until Tuesday. I would not rent from these folks again. Our first rental with Air B&B was enough to cause us to use another service next time.",1,“Filthy apartment with lots of problems and terrible customer service.”

On top of all that to get an email after the verification process had failed and the booking cancelled to be told that my account had been debited and that there may be a delay in refunding it to my credit card was a shock to me.

I chose a place within a few blocks of her house (""Retro Retreat,"" host: Matthew).  After jumping through a bunch of hoops, including identification verification, I paid the amount ($767) through PayPal and made a tentative reservation (their words). The next evening I get an email saying that they were going to ""release' my payment because the owner, Matthew, hadn't responded within 24 hours. Huh? That's how they do business. The owner doesn't even have the common decency (or business sense) to give me a response, so I don't get to rent the place?  (I'm wondering since in the ""Tell us about yourself"" spot on the application I mentioned we were retired, there was some possible ageism involved.) Oh!  and the notice said that the ""release of the deposit"" won't show up for a week. Thank goodness I paid through PayPal and they hadn't deducted my money yet. And, we are flush enough that we could proceed to secure another place without having to wait for our money. I know that's not the case for everyone.  I would steer very clear of airbnb -- their business methods, in my opinion, are very shady.

523,"Airbnb does not pay out the hosts enough to make hosting a room on their website to random strangers worth it. You take a massive risk with Airbnb, as their insurance does not actually provide any useful protection or insurance. Even to apply for such protection in the case of an emergency is a massive headache and time sink that does not equate the effort it takes to apply. 

Airbnb takes 3% for their own cut, a standard 28% for taxes regardless of your state, and can randomly charge you all several additional penalties, such as $50 for any cancellation you might make, even if that cancellation is due to an emergency or because you feel highly uncomfortable with a guest. 

Realize that you are unable to interview a guest by phone or email before inviting them into your home. Communication through Airbnb is highly restricted and censored. So you're just hoping that the person's Airbnb profile is accurate. 

It's simply not worth the headache of hosting some stranger that you cannot interview before handing them the keys to your home with zero protection. Imagine if one of those guests who you so willing give your keys to for a measly payout goes an makes a copy of your key, and breaks in after their stay and robs your home--or much worse. 

I feel terrible for guests for getting overcharged on the room, and much worse for hosts who have to put their lives and property at risk for a second petty income. If you need the money so desperately, do something else. Walk people's dogs, pick up a random babysitting shift, whatever you want to do -- just don't host on Airbnb.

I assume that this is your request for Marc's listing. Please see price breakdown below:

Exchange Rate: 1.03
In CAD: $211 CAD (2*nights) + $59 CAD (Cleaning fee) + $31 CAD (Airbnb Service Fee) = $301 TOTAL
In USD: $204 (2*nights) + $57 (Cleaning Fee) + $31 (Airbnb Service Fee) = $292 TOTAL

The rates have been converted to USD, The exchange rate is just minimal and we round it to the nearest whole amount that's why sometimes it just equates to the previous currency.

After we were back from our trip, the host filed a claim for damages stating that we had infested her home with bed bugs. She alleges that the same night of our departure, she slept in our bedroom suite and woke up the next morning with hundreds of bites all over her body. 

Not one person in our party had a single bite. I even contacted the hotel we stayed at after our stay at the AirBnB home. They brought in professionals to inspect all the rooms, and did an extra examination of the two rooms we stayed in. They found no evidence whatsoever of bed bugs. 

I have been fighting this claim since we returned home. Thursday, August 20, 2015, I received an email from AirBnB stating that we were in NO WAY responsible for bed bugs. This morning (August 30, 2015)  I woke up to read another email from AirBnB stating that WE ARE responsible and they have already charged our credit card for the damages. 

I would like other to people who may want to use AirBnB over a hotel to understand the risks they may incur. We have no way of defending ourselves and proving that we DID NOT HAVE BED BUGS.

I ended up sleeping on a bunk bed in the laundry room and there was absolutely no privacy.  He accepted another booking and expected me to ""move"" into his room and his bed sharing his master bath while he stayed on the property in a camper.  He also expected me to maintain the property, care for his dog, and run his airbnb business so he could go on vacation.  Single female so my creepy meter went off.  I paid for 30 days in advance.

Last one was uninhabitable because it was too hot inside the premises - the host had all the windows locked shut. From now on I'll travel less, use budget motels and find hostels to stay at. For the amount of time and effort involved in securing a decent airbnb space it just isn't worth it. And airbnb doesn't remedy misrepresentations or properly refund guest charges when they should. They give you a number to call in the event of a problem but these people airbnb agents you talk to are apparently incentivized not to offer any solutions that would cost them $$ - they just like to talk. And agents contradict each other and don't follow thru on resolution promises.",1,“i used to like airbnb” 
549,"I used the airbnb website to find rental properties for my family vacation. We found several properties and tried to book them. Turns out that you have to wait up to 24 hours for the owner to respond, and in the meantime you wait and don't know if the owner will accept your proposal or not. Some of the owners declined, some of them did not respond at all, and one of them even accepted and later declined. In the latter case my credit card was charged. They sent me an email ""asking"" if I want a 10% discount on the next reservation, or if I want a refund. I did not notice that an action is required from my side. Only when I reviewed my credit card charges and saw the charge, I contacted airbnb who explained I have to ""request"" the refund in order to receive it. I got very angry. What if I did not notice the charge on my credit card? maybe I was never going to get my money back. In short, I don't recommend using this website. Better use other website where you can make immediate booking and not wait until owners respond, let alone take your money before the reservation materializes.",1,“Beware of using this website” 
550,"The web site is set up in a way that is pretty deceiving, so BE CAREFUL. When you select a property you are interested in, there are 2 big buttons to choose from. One says ""Request Booking"", the other says ""Add to Wish List"". Since I was interested in corresponding with the host and determining availability, I selected ""Request Booking"". BIG MISTAKE ... I am sure it is somewhere in the small print, but if you click this button and the host indicates the property is available, YOU ARE CHARGED! And good luck getting your money back!! I seriously thought I was sending an inquiry and once the host told me it was available I would go back in and do the actual booking. As it turns out, you must scroll way way way way down to the bottom and locate the tiny little button that says ""email owner"" if you are not ready to have your money stolen.

The customer service is AWFUL! The host was nice and understood what had happened. He authorized for me to receive a 100% refund of the rental fees, but Air BnB was still going to only refund $390.00 (out of $882.00!!). I am still fighting to get the rental fees refunded. I highly doubt they will refund the ""Air BnB service charge"" of $85.00.

553,"I was a first time Airbnb user, and was traveling to Los Angeles for weekend with my 2 teenage daughters. We were driving from a neighboring state, and mainly wanted a house with a kitchen so we could cook some meals, and save money on the vacation. I am a fairly skeptical and through person, and I read the amenities section very carefully. Unfortunately, this host, Kendra G, in L.A, only had one review, which was positive, but I would have preferred more.  I have since learned reviews cannot be trusted, that often people are afraid of offending the host and aren't honest, or that hosts even get friends to write fake reviews for them. (They can do this by booking the location, paying for a night or two, writing a review, then receiving the cash back from the host/friend for the ""reservation"") that in fact never happened I took a leap of faith and after a couple messages back and forth, I booked her 2 bedroom art-deco house in the Eagle Rock neighborhood, for it's seemingly decent neighborhood, and it's proximity to all areas of L.A County, for $129 per night.

The house had no AC, which she had listed on the property description.  However, it was during a heatwave in L.A, she only provided one fan, (This was for 2 bedrooms), and worse even, two windows had screens missing, one on the master bedroom, so those windows couldn't be left open at night to cool the house down.  She also charged a $75 cleaning fee, per reservation, yet when we checked in, the kitchen counters were dirty, and needed wiping, and the kitchen was also moderately dirty. For a $75 cleaning fee, you don't expect to have dirty feet after going barefoot for 10 minutes, or to find popcorn and other debris sticking to your feet in the kitchen. Her front door also had a broken doorknob lock, (working deadbolt) and the front door stuck SO bad several times during our 3 night stay, we had to go out the back patio slider, around to the front, and physically push our way in through the front door, just to leave the house.  It's a very unpleasant thing to do in 100 degree heat, in a sweltering house, as you're trying to leave.

Those were moderately irritating, but the worst was discovered as we opened the house up to cool it down.  A large window in the dining area not only was missing a screen, but the lock was also completely missing. NO lock whatsoever, not even a dowel.  The patio slider, (Very old, with plate glass), also had a lock that was completely GONE. Missing! It didn't even close all the way leaving a 1/4 gap, even when it was slid shut all the way.  the slider had a large dowel in it, but in fact, the slider could still be slid open 6-8 inches, allowing a slender person to possibly slip through and get into the house. Now, we're talking about a house in Los Angeles, not some country town in the middle of nowhere where you can leave your doors unlocked. It was a huge security concern, and we ended up fashioning dowels and adding some makeshift security measures, that made the house feel slightly safer to leave our valuables in. We didn't feel comfortable leaving our laptops, jewelry, anything! I emailed the host, who have a bunch of excuses, but bottom line, it was ridiculous to deal with that.  Of all the things you expect from a rental, door and window locks being present and in good working condition are an absolute MUST, and not a trivial complaint.  

Air bnb has a double blind review system, to keep people honest.  If the host and guest both write reviews for each other, they publish publicly simultaneously, to keep people from basing what they say on what the other person says. Once that's done, the host has one chance to reply to your review, however it's written. Kendra G wrote a pleasant review of myself, and my daughters, as guests. My review was very honest about the lax security, and the hosts blasé attitude about it. I was not directly rude towards her as a person, but I stated the obvious, no one willingly pays for a rental, even in a ""peer to peer"" community, with broken door.window locks, and substandard security for yourself and your belongings.  She was VERY unhappy, and wrote an extremely snarky response to my negative review.  Interestingly, she never denied that the doors/windows had broken locks and missing screens, she just used the public format and her degree in public relations to call me a poor guest, and say my dissatisfaction was ""unwarranted."" I guess it's laughable that she only had that to say, when she read my negative review. So, in theory, the double blind system is good, keeping people honest. However, the fact that other reviews can either be faked, or not really trusted, makes me leery of EVER using Airbnb again. I certainly would NOT use it if I was going to foreign country! At least, close to home, you can figure it out if your reservation goes completely wrong!
Stay away from Kendra G's L.A home, unless she's made those few small door/window lock and screen fixes, that would make her guests so much more comfortable. Other than that, be very wary going into a Airbnb reservation, and DEFINITELY have a back-up plan!",1,"“Used Airbnb once, and likely won't again..” "

555,"We tried airbnb for the first time.  We secured a Montreal downtown loft.  It advertised air conditioning.  When we arrived, it was +33 degrees C outside.  The inside of the loft was just as hot without air circulation.  The window air conditioner was blowing air, but clearly not enough to cool the place (either broken or simply not big enough unit).  We called owner.  Owner said it was too late to call technician.  He came over with a fan.  We spent one of the worst nights ever in an accommodation.  We paid $235 for one night of hell.  We could have gotten a decent hotel with air conditioning for this price.  The issues I have with airbnb is that you have no recourse if there is an issue.  If this had happened in a hotel, they would have put us up somewhere where it was cool, or they would have refunded us for our experience.  Other issues is the ridiculous cleaning fee they charge.  Isn't cleaning the cost of doing business?  If you need to cover this cost, then build into the price.  We left the place spotless except for 2 used towels and bedding.  It was stated on the site that renters remove all of their garbage before they leave, wash their dishes, and if shoes are worn in the apartment, renters will be charged additionally.  We were appalled when the property owner walked into the space with his shoes on.  With a hotel chain, you can usually know what you are getting.  If there is a problem, they will do something about it to keep your business.  With airbnb, your only recourse is a bad review.  We wrote to airbnb, and so far, we have received nothing back.",1,“Buyer beware”

The request was denied. I am betting the price goes up again today. 
Contacted airbnb and they said they can't control it and have no repercussions for hosts that raise their prices in this manner. Good luck with that business!

Airbnb offered an extra £100 towards another booking but with so limited notice of the cancellation any remaining accommodation in the area was either too much or unavailable.

The host requested that we should not make noise at night, so I always reminded myself and I did not make noise. However, they forgot to tell me that I could not shower after 10pm or the neighbors would be disturbed. After the host told me not to do so in the next morning, I apologized and he accepted it, and I did not do that again. And everything is fine until I left a good review on the host profile. She, the another host, accused me as a noisy guest and disrespectful of house rules, which I am furious about that. Why should I withstand this after obeying her house rules, or maybe because of her mistake to forget to tell me not to shower? Plus, she has a very bad attitude and being offensive when I asked her why she accused me in this way, such as saying 'are you normal or what', but every word I said to her is based on fact and show my kindness. I wish I can upload our conversation here so everyone here can have a clear picture.

So, I took it, thinking I could file a claim with Airbnb for the rest. When I called Airbnb the representative I spoke with agreed that I should get a refund, but when they finally got around to reviewing my dispute, it was denied, the reason was that ""I stayed in the flat."" Apparently Airbnb's solution for their customers is for the customer to leave the flat and walk the streets looking for a new hotel last minute.

564,"Terrible experience, the refund was denied by Aibnb, here is my complaint to BBB Business Review and my story:
I used Airbnb to book an apartment for a four night stay for a family vacation. The rental was advertised as accommodation for 8 people with 3 bedrooms, it tuned out to have 3 single beds in 3 bedrooms to accommodate 3 people maximum. One of the beds was small child's bed, smaller and shorter than regular twin bed. We never checked in as when we saw the apartment, it was clear we will never fit in, never got the keys or brought the luggage. The person that showed the apartment to us agreed that we can not stay there unless we sleep on the floor. The Owner has apologized, called around to see if he can get some extra mattresses and after he didn't succeed, he offered the full refund if we cancel. We had to book the hotel for just 1 night while sending requests for other apartments through Airbnb. We cancelled the original reservation through the website, but refund was declined. We spent 3 days talking to Airbnb representatives that refuse to give refund saying that the number of beds is correct we have no right to refund based on number of sleeping accommodations. All hotels are fully booked in Barcelona in August, Airbnb didn't refund $1000 and we needed a place to stay, we had no choice, but to try settle for this apartment even we would sleep on the floor. But the owner has already re-booked it. So we paid for it with NO refund and NO accommodation available that we were charged for. We never checked in or got the key. So we ended up with no money or apartment while the Airbnb and the owner got paid twice as they rebooked our dates.
I would like a full refund. 
The apartment was newly listed and had only 1 review, so I couldn't see if other visitors had found the accommodation capacity to be as misstated as I did. I contacted the host using the phone number on my reservation to ask about the refund or possible stay if there is no refund, but received no reply to my calls or texts for 2 days. Eventually he wrote to me that the matter of refund is out of his hands and up to Airbnb and the he re-rented the apartment to another guests for the days we booked it originally. So the ""host"" got paid twice and my family and I were left without the money $1000 and without the place to stay.
I began the complaint process with Airbnb immediately on the fist day and I was told to cancel the reservation formally through the website. Ultimately Airbnb didn't issue a refund, but instead offered a coupon for future stay in an amount less than one fourth of what I paid Airbnb for the rental. They denial of refund was based on the fact that the number of beds matter, not the number of guests advertised. Also, it was noted that I should have taken pictures of the issues I raised in my complaint. I was in the apartment only 15 minutes, never been given the key, the owner agreed to refund and I didn't think to stop and snap some pictures. Is my testimony and the testimony of my family not enough? Why would I lie about this? Would pictures of three tiny beds really add anything to the complaint? And now because I was advised by the Airbnb customer service associate to cancel the reservation, I am unable to post an honest review of the space and warn future potential guests to stay away from this rental. To me this is the most egregious trespass ** all since the whole foundation of the Airbnb model and the so-called ""sharing economy"" is the customer review system.",1,“Bad business practice by Airbnb”

Anyway, I've had used my account twice since creating my account in 2014. First time when I booked an apartment in Europe and second time when I booked another apartment in the States. On both occasions, I received great reviews from the apartments owners and I wrote great reviews back about them as well. Everything was going smoothly. Two months ago, I wanted to check apartments in Europe again, but when I logged in, it prompted me with a message telling me ""my account has been disabled please contact support"". I contacted support thinking it was a simple mistake. However, they replied, ""We've reviewed your account and determined that you have violated Airbnb's Terms of Service. As a result, we've decided it's in the best interest of our community to deactivate your account. We'll contact you if anything changes in the future, but until then, we won't be able to assist you any further with your account issues"".
At first I thought it was a joke, so I replied back and asked them to elaborate on how I violated Airbnb's terms of service. No one replied to my email. I emailed them again without any reply. So I decided to go on twitter. After my first tweet, they replied and said they are going to look into my account.

After booking and paying for my room some 35 days in advance I thought everything was set and cool.  At the last minute, practically on the eve of my departure, they suspended my account and canceled my paid reservation without explanation.  I only found out through a private message from my chosen host as I was packing to leave.  When I tried to correct Airbnb over the matter they demanded a copy of my passport, access to my Face Book and Google accounts and reconfirmation of my cell number.  I didn't want a last-minute derailment of my plans so I unwisely complied.  After all that, they wrote that my already 30 days ahead paid reservation was illegitimate and that my account was suspended. Attempts to receive a reason were ignored and I was repeatedly told that they didn't have to give an explanation and were not liable in any way for the mess. Subsequently I had to revoke their permissions, change passwords and accept their corporate hubris / insulting customer service as the ""final word"".  I am now very committed to telling the world of my wretched experience in hopes of sparing other trusting travelers a similar big steaming pile or Airbnb treatment.  The good news is, my money was refunded (they had no choice really), I didn't add to their profits and my host of choice understood and received me with a nice welcome. Beware of Airbnb.  They might jerk you around as you're in departure as well.  I am glad to say that already 4 other friends have now dumped their plans to use Airbnb and I will continue on a righteous mission to share my experience honestly as a cautionary tale regarding Airbnb.  The exponential result should make it worthwhile.  Choose wisely and seek accommodations elsewhere.",1,“Airbnb Experience... YUCK!   Buyer Beware!    Look Elsewhere!”

Curiously I checked the calendar for the unit and it shows ""Updated today"" (i.e., 8/4/15) and ""Minimum 13 night stay"".

Then tried to make a second booking and Airbnb indicated that I have to verify my account with a driver's license or passport. Not going to do that, WAY too invasive. Now my account is locked in the verify step and I can't edit my account or make any other bookings until it is verified with a government issued ID. The guy on the phone (after finding their phone number through a Google search) confirmed that the account cannot be used until the overly invasive verification step is completed. He said that nobody would see the ID! Huh? Why do they insist on having it submitted if nobody is going to see it? Unbelievable! Wow, they really don't want to work with real people and will never see any more business from me.
Here is the ""Part 2"".  We worked with AirBnB from July through September.  We continued to have a reservation showing as current for our daughter's wedding, but were still blocked from accessing anything on the website, including the details of our own, paid, reservation.  After numerous phone calls and emails (we wait days and days for replies) they finally said, ""verfiy or we cancel the reservation"". They claim that they have to know we weren't ""bots"" (um, you're talking to me) or a rapist (but they claim they don't do background checks). We cancelled. Found accommodations through VRBO, deal done in less than 24 hours.  I agree with another reviewer that the ""verification"" progress may be a way to allow hosts to avoid renting to ethnicities and religions they don't like.  I mentioned that to them and had a fairly hostile response.  Just saying.",1,"“Beware the ""verify"" step Part 2” "

584,"Airbnb has the worst host customer service I've dealt ever dealt with. My first Airbnb customer arrived 3 hours per our agreement. Forced/begged....even used her kids as an excuse to come in early before the cleaners had even finished. She arrived with 2 small children, 2 nannies, her husband, and herself. I allowed this because I have a soft spot for children and it was my first guest through Airbnb (Plenty of guests through craigslist). I wanted it to go smoothly. What was said to be a quick stop for luggage drop off and diaper changes quickly turned into an hour of the nannies going through every drawer in the house. It took my cleaners twice as long. That night, they still washed every single towel, pillow, sheet, blanket, etc in the house. The washing machine was on for 12 hours consistently. Everything had just been washed in front of them!! When they arrived there weren't even sheets on the beds! Not to mention, they hung every single article to dry on my wooden patio furniture outside. White on wood isn't a good idea right? I wake up the next morning to 80% of the windows completely open with BOTH floor AC units on. When they arrived the day before I went over the house rules verbally, one of which was, ""please keep the windows closed when you run the heating/cooling systems as they will become ridiculously expensive"". Her response was- ""Oh this weather is perfect, we wont be using them often"". The icing on the cake came when I found 3 broken crystal glasses in the dumpster and the ""dry clean only"" back pillows of the gray couch in the picture, washed and turned inside out on my patio furniture!! I then decided I would be nice and instead of making a huge ordeal, simply print out a small list of house rules. ""Use Eco friendly on washer, etc"". This did not go over so well with her and she passive aggressively cancelled a reservation she had over a month in advanced! Now here's the part that makes Airbnb an awful mediator and pretty much voids any type of protection for the host. When I first set up my account, I went through thoroughly and set everything I wanted, including my cancellation setting. When I received this inquiry (my first), I recognized my cancellation policy was still set to ""flexible"". Frantic, I emailed the preapproved guest and told her I noticed she could cancel on me within 24 hours. I told her since this is a month in advanced I would definitely like to know if the commitment is mutual or tentative. She agreed through email she was fully committed. Longer story shorter, she sends me a message the morning after I gave her a second set of keys and the house rules list saying her child is having a hard time with the stairs so they are altering their stay. I was sent a message to ""accept"" or ""deny"" request of which I hit deny. I had turned down 6 reservations for this time slot which I held for a month. I was sent an override by airbnb with no contact from their office. When I reach out through the help center, I receive an automated response not even pertaining to my issue. When I call I am directed to the Resolution center. This morning, I receive an email rejecting my investigation stating my cancellation policy was set to flexible. NO ONE reads into the threads. I recognized this from speaking with the guy on the phone, which btw good luck finding the number on Airbnb! No one truly investigates. They read the first page and find the quickest response they can that kinda matches, all of which are prewritten and they put their names on them as if they wrote it personally. I've spent more hours reexplaining this situation than I have getting it handled. This is NOT what I signed up for and I hope everyone realizes it can happen to you very easily. I will be sticking to my own lease agreement paperwork and security deposit from now on. It's worked wonders for me through craigslist. It is not worth the extra money Airbnb takes out of my stays to be a mediator when their best interest clearly leans to one side; theirs. Especially when they mention this great insurance policy yet they are telling me they have no power once they resend the money back to the customer.",1,“WOW.” 
585,Must be the worst company out there to deal with.  very unhelpful.  take your money for your booking in full plus their costs without it showing it properly on their website.  When you contact them and try to get a refund oh they will only refund 50% even though you have not taken the holiday.  Also they don't even pay the holiday owner until you have been.  Luckily we have been in direct contact with the owner now and all is ok but I would never ever ever recommend using Airbnb for anything.  They are rubbish,1,“Airbnb” 
586,"We booked a place in London and the host cancelled on us. Airbnb did give us some compensation towards booking another place, which we duly did.

This site is overrun with unreliable, unprofessional host who are dipping their toes in the water for a few extra pounds. 

When it suits them, they will accept your booking, when it it doesn't they will cancel your booking and the hosts don't give two hoots about ruining your trip and plans.

Not only that, there is no way to leave a negative review on an owner if they cancel your reservation so who knows how often this stuff is happening!

A refund and then a 10% discount if I would rent another apartment. A whole whopping $110. The apartments offered were not comparable to what I had rented.  I believe Airbnb should have found me a place equal to or better than I had rented and eaten any additional cost. Instead, they left 3 women, 3000 miles from home stranded.

I think it is telling that airbnb does not give me (or anyone else) the opportunity to comment on hosts who have cancelled reservations... in other words, there is no way for me to check whether a potential new host is 'reliable' or also prone to short-term cancellations.

Having never used Airbnb before I arranged the dates with the owner and emailed back and forth a few times.  Somehow he got direct access to my email.  Then I received an email different from the one I had used with the owner which looked like an Airbnb email address.  The email included an invoice which had the Airbnb logo, dates, confirmation number, photo of the villa, what was available at the villa, including the summary of costs and any extras like a cleaner and then bank details for a bank with an Airbnb account name.  The whole thing was very professional and looked like a bonafide invoice.  The money was paid and when I tried to confirm something, the supposed owner stopped replying.  By this stage the villa had been taken off the Airbnb website and it became clear that it was a scam as soon as we informed Airbnb.  This has obviously happened more than once and Airbnb when contacted did nothing.  They are very difficult to get hold of and didn't reply to most of my emails.  They don't want to take any responsibility at all and there is no compensation as I had not followed their terms and conditions.  Why do they not have warnings up of their procedures as you go?  I have of course learnt a valuable lesson but I have also lost my graduation holiday in addition to losing Euro1,900 and airline tickets.  I tried for 10 days to get a response from Airbnb and they don't seem to care that there is a sophisticated fraudster using their site to scam their customers.  They even had the temerity to say when we finally got a reply that they are sorry about our experience and I quote  'we hope you'll go on to have many positive experiences on Airbnb in the future.'

I paid $142 for the entire night and once I cancelled I only recived $35 back (this all happened within a 10 minute window when I submitted my payment and suddenly had to cancel) the rest of the $107 went to the Host, and Airbnb took $15. I contacted the host asking what to do to get the rest of my money back and she ""acted"" like she didn't know what I could do so I called customer service and they told me all of that money goes to her! I was furious because once I informed her that I was aware that she pocketed MY $92 her answer was ""since I booked the place it went off the site when other users could have been looking to stay""  which I understand but then she agrees to give me half, $46. So I gladly accept. She alerts me that she submitted the $46 dollars but to this day I have not received it!

619,"If you're in the LA area, do not rent from Erick R. through Airbnb!!! (1383 Hauser Blvd Appartment 8 Los Angeles, CA 90019) I should have known from the beginning it was not going to be a good trip because the host was unresponsive until I contacted Airbnb and let them know he had not reached out with check in instructions. 

I don't need much but expect the place to be clean. It was not. I came in from a red eye and was hoping to get some shut eye before a packed trip. My trip was only 5 days but each day was filled so I really did not have time to spare. First off, the parking is gated but off a busy street, meaning you have to stop traffic, open the gate, run back into your car, and park. When I first parked, the creepy neighbor downstairs peeked one eye out from behind the curtain to see who was in their lot. That's cool. I'm not easily scared. 

When I got upstairs, there were hairs everywhere when I lifted the sheets. Hairs of all sorts included pubic hairs!!! When I texted the host, he said there were replacement sheets in the closet. I unfolded the supposedly clean sheets and there was a huge brown stain in the corner with a few splattered spots. 

Furthermore, outside noise was extremely loud. I could hear their neighbors walking around in their homes, using the bathrooms, talking on the phones. 

First, I tried cancelling online. The host said he could not honor my request because he was losing money. I got on the phone with Airbnb and told the situation. I told them I already went ahead and made reservations with a hotel bc I could not waste more time with surprises. I explained this to the host as well and expressed my intense disappointment. 

Anyways, I get home to review the listing to find that I wasn't allowed to because I had canceled it! What a scam! The Airbnb rep said next time I should read the reviews (which I did). So, that makes me think... what about all those people that arrived, hated it, and canceled because they found pubs in their sheet too?! I would never know because they weren't allowed to review.

622,"This was my first time using airbnb and I will never use it again and never recommend it to anyone! I had a long term reservation (originally supposed to be 5 months) but experienced problem after problem.
1) My reservation was a long term and during it I occasionally traveled to other cities in the country for a few days, but would leave the majority of my stuff at the place I was staying in, thinking it would be safe. While I was gone, my host had put up a second listing of the apartment (which was two bedrooms, mine and hers) and rented out MY room to other travelers. She packed up all my stuff and would rent the room out to other people when I wasn't there. I only found out because I  came back early one time, all my stuff was still packed up (taken out of the closet and shoved into my suitcase) and someone had forgot their slippers in my room.
2) I contacted airbnb about how I could move out without the cancellation policy being enforced, and they told me to just put in a request to alter the reservation and then I wouldn't be stuck paying the 30 day fee for not giving notice. Later that month I was charged $400 from airbnb and they told me it was because my host enforced her cancellation policy and they couldn't refund me the money even though they gave me misleading information. 
Basically, airbnb gave me wrong information and I was penalized for it. They scam you out of your money!!! And to top it off I was living with a crazy person for almost 3 months!!

Over the last two weeks we have lost three customers because the website, especially the payment system wouldn't work effectively (it could have been four customers but one had the sense to contact me privately).  I spent an hour on on the phone this morning with their Customer Service (the number BTW is not on their website and I had to google it) and they said that they had fixed the problem. The CSR - who was extremely polite - said it was some sort of incompatibility between the e-mail I have on AirBnB and the e-mail on PayPal.  He also said that he would send out an e-mail to my potential customers stating that it was AirBnB's fault not mine.  Well the problem was not fixed and we lost another customer who got so frazzled she decided to stay in a hotel.

This is unforgivable.   I did a lot of work and shopping to get the place ready for the guests and I am out of pocket by about $1,000.

Why I chose them? Because they are SUPERHOST. I was tricked, really. 

When I checked in, I found the smell was quite strange but I didn't complaint to host because I thought it was reasonable and came from textiles. But then, I was tricked by hosts.

They did accuse me using a strong smell perfume with menthol smell which I never used. I also was blamed because that smell was stick on the textile. It's so funny that in fact I only stayed with them for 1 NIGHT ONLY! Yes, 1 night and most of my time was outside of their house because I was tourist to Sweden. What kind of strong smell you expect to be sticking on the textile and must put extra effort to remove it? Hosts even said that they need to buy new bed and textile! How come?

Also the fact that I hate perfume and NEVER use perfume in any occasions, it's something that I complaint to airbnb because that accusation is appeared on my public profile. Host waited for 4 days after I checked out to accuse me in fact they wrote on their house rules that they ALWAYS check airbnb (I took a picture of their house rules and sent to airbnb).

Airbnb didn't do anything, I complaint and said they can't remove that false review because it will break their regulations that built by trusts and transparency. What kind of trusts? Even they can't remove any disputest review and testimonials.

626,"I have been a Real Estate investor/landlord/agent for 40 yrs. I was contacted by Airbnb who found me on Craigslist 6 yrs. ago when they were just a few guys in S.F. renting out their couches, asking if they could list my rentals on their new website. I agreed. I was a loyal airbnb host for 6 yrs. I took total strangers from all over the world into my private Los Angeles estate guest houses, our Las Vegas vacation rental, and my famous W. Hlwd. Jim Morrison bldg. I accepted 1st time guests from all over the world who had no host reviews. I took their pets. I did this because Airbnb offered me a false sense of security, by holding guests security deposits and offering a host guarantee insurance policy which is currently $1,000,000.00. Yes, a million dollars!
Lets talk about the ""Bad"" guests. They ranged from irresponsible nuisances to shrewd con artists. There were the ones who broke or stole a few minor items, the ones who violated our common sense/common courtesy rules, or the ones who required ""special services"" but didn't want to pay for them after. The worst guests included necessary police intervention or major theft caught on CCTV cameras. There was the group of ""squatters."" They were wolves in sheep's clothing who came to me as short term vacation rental guests. Visualize ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" in a pickup truck with their dogs. They came off sweet as pie (landlord 101: beware of overly nice prospective tenants. No one is that nice! They are usually desperate people with bad credit, no job, who can't get anyone else to rent to them!) He even took on the job as handyman around the apt. bldg. They were able to drag out their stay, doling out breadcrumbs by paying a few days at a time. When it came time for them to check out, these predators who apparently support themselves by ""working the system"" refused to vacate the premises screaming ""permanent tenant rights"" in the grand scheme of things to con me out of $13,500 in re-location fees and to be able to extend their stay for one more year under the cities rent control laws!!!
As if this wasn't bad enough, I also got sued by the city who extorted me for nearly $16,000 in perceived TOT fees, which ended up costing me nearly $5000 in attys fees (who took my money and resigned from the case after doing nothing) before I ended up having to pay the city nearly $10,000 in fines. 
THIS IS WHAT BEING AN AIRBNB HOST COST ME. And what support did I get from airbnb?
Now lets talk about airbnb. They come off syrupy sweet, calling you an ""awesome Superhost."" They act like airbnb is all about ""sharing space"" and ""making friends."" If I were looking for friendship, I'd join a social club. Lets get one thing straight. It's renting out space. Real estate. Real estate is a business. Bottom line, you are in business to make money.
AIrbnb is in business to make money. They take it from both ends- their hosts and their guests. They block out parts of hosts and guests email correspondence if they suspect it includes sharing contact information. Don't let them kid you. They expect hosts and guests to trust them with total stranger connections, lodging, and finances, but they do not trust their own hosts or guests to be able to communicate with one another in fear they will get cut out of the deal. 
As airbnb & their # of hosts grew during the past few years (as did their negative reviews which began popping up all over on various websites) due to their mass marketing campaign, they appeared to care less and less about their hosts and guests. The 1st big scandal I read about was the host in California whose home was totally trashed by airbnb guests. That's when airbnb came up with their ""$50,000.00 host guarantee policy"" to provide panicked hosts a false sense of security. Most recently was the home in Canada that was totally trashed by airbnb guests. Airbnb upped the ante to $1,000,000.00. To be eligible for that type of host coverage, I suspect the entire family would need to be brutally murdered.
I am a professional, honest, trustworthy, ""to the book"" type host. I never once went behind Airbnb's back to try to cut them out of their original booking commission because I believe in karma and I believe everyone is entitled to their fair share of what they contributed. Also, never once did one of my guests ever make a theft claim while staying in our rental units. That speaks volumes for my honesty and integrity.
Many guests don't realize that when they book through airbnb, all payment is handled directly by airbnb. They never allow the host to be in possession of the security deposit. So when a guest commits damage, theft, violations of rules or requires special services, I exercised my host rights and filed a claim with airbnb under the guest's security deposit. To avoid having to process claims, airbnb will attempt to discourage hosts by running you through the hoops. Think boot camp! 1st you have to go through the ""Resolution request"" (asking your guest to pay you.) This link is nearly impossible to find on their site. Once you have found it, filled out the form, and sent it to your guest, the guest will usually deny the damage/theft, etc., get angry that you ""accused them,"" refuse to pay, then leave you a false negative retaliatory review.
If you don't hear back from the guest or they deny the claim, you have to mark your calendar to remember to contact airbnb to ""get involved."" (if you forget, you are out of luck on the claim as the deadline has expired.) In order to involve airbnb, they will require photos, witnesses, original receipts, and/or comps. As a real estate investor with multiple fully furnished properties in 3 locations in 3 states, I would have hire someone to pull dead files out of storage and spend days going through thousands of receipts through the years to find one for a towel, mug, pillow or whatever for the damaged or missing item(s) in question! Once you have completed the form & provided the ""evidence"" (they do not trust their hosts word, despite the fact the host trusted them to have these strangers in their home who broke/stole their personal property items!) you wait to hear back from airbnb. None of my claims were what I would consider ""substantial"" amounts of money. Some claims were processed, but as time went on they were either denied, reduced, or ignored. When a guest flooded my unit, I filed a claim for $2,500.00 for my out of pocket costs. This was my and only claim that came under the $1,000,000.00 Host guarantee policy. After I went through airbnb's claim ""boot camp"" process, they said they were only willing to pay $500 firm (20% of my claim,) Final decision, no appeal. 
Shortly thereafter, with no warning they deleted all of my listings and cancelled all of my bookings for the rest of the year. They told my future guests that it was I who had cancelled their bookings, so I had angry guests contacting me not realizing the truth, that airbnb had lied to them and that I was as much an airbnb victim as they were! 
I still have approx. 1/2 dozen minimal claims airbnb ignored and never paid over the past year, along with the one and only claim I filed in 6 yrs. under the $1,000,000.00 Host guarantee claim for $2,500.00 that I was never compensated for.

The next morning he ran the pump all day and the water cleared somewhat. He never cleaned the filter or the bottom or sides of the pool. The next day he didn't clean or run the pump.  The pool water was never clear and the sides and bottom were slimy. Our party  consisted of 12 adults and 4 little kids. All of the kids and some adults spent a lot time in the pool. One is suffering an ear infection..      While eating dinner the second night the owner's dog was chased away from the table by my husband. The dog left. After dinner we were sitting around the table and the dog returned. He received several pats on the back and my brother even removed several ticks from him because he was loaded with them. My husband whistled at him and he came to him. My husband petted him then the dog growled and nipped at him. He then left.  The next day the dog was running around and no problem. After lunch one three year old boy who was standing still by the table was bit by the dog with no provocation. The boy's father and my husband went after the dog. In the meantime Ezequiel (who told us the dog was his) stayed  in his house instead of getting his dog.  My husband caught the dog and was bitten several times before the dog was hopefully dispatched by him.

668,"DO NOT USE AIRBNB.  THEY HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THE OWNERS WHO POST ON THE SITE.  In August 2014, I booked a home in Parkland, Florida for 14 members of my family to stay for 4 nights over Thanksgiving weekend.  My family was flying in from all over the U,S.  This was my first experience with Airbnb.   I paid $3392 to Airbnb in August, the full price of the rental of a 7 bedroom, 5 bath home.  Last week, I received an e-mail that the owner of the house, Gary, has CANCELLED MY RESERVATION.  Airbnb was very sorry.  No reason was given for the cancellation. If I had cancelled at anytime, I would have lost 50% of my money.  Gary, the owner, was able to walk away.  The house is no longer posted on Airbnb, although it is on VRBO.

       As a result of the cancellation,  Airbnb gave me three links to other homes as possible replacements.  Two were in Miami which were geographically undesirable.  The third was a ""mansion"" listed at a price $1,000 per night.  When I wrote to the owner to see if the home was available over Thanksgiving, ""Richard"" said that it was but that the price was now $8,000 for the 4 days.   Because someone else showed interest in the house, he was reducing the price to over $6,000 since that was what he had quoted them. ($2,000 more than what was listed).  Supervisor, Elena G., offered me money from her ""discretionary "" account to make up the difference, thus encouraging hosts to gouge their prices.

  Airbnb has no control over hosts who can cancel at any time. Additionally, hosts can freely charge what they want regardless of what is posted in the listing,   Airbnb allows this to happen. I was not able to find a house for 14 people in time for Thanksgiving.  We are all staying at hotels and have not figured out where to have our Thanksgiving dinner at this time.  A supervisor at Airbnb did give me a voucher for $500 for my troubles after I asked for some compensation.  I was also promised my  refund of the $3392 which Airbnb had since early Sept.",1,“DO NOT USE AIRBNB” 
669,"In fairness to air b and b, I only have an upcoming stay booked but REALLY dislike their policies and wish that we had never booked through them. I further have an instinct that much of the appeal of this site is to make yourself feel cool and current using it.

In further fairness to the site, I could have personally researched their policies before participating in the transaction described below. I simply (and reasonably) assumed that we merely were booking a place for $X/night and would pay most or all the amount at the end of the stay. I also figured that there might have been some form of cancellation fee, but not that we were gambling roughly $1,000.

My travel (and life) partner booked a vacation a few months ago, and he advocated using air b and b; again to be fair, his experience renting places has been positive. I have not accompanied him on these trips.

The primary issues that I have with this service, which does not seem to even have a customer support email on its website, are that it collects all your money at the time of the reservation, does not allow cancellations for any reason, charges the person making the reservation a 10-percent fee on top of the 5 percent that it charges the homeowner, and does not even pay the homeowner until after the stay is complete. (I do not know if the homeowner gets the money if we do not go.)

I have no cause for complaining that my partner selected a place at the upper end of the price that we were looking to pay. I also accept the clearly stated cleaning fee, which likely will net the owner a nice profit for spending what surely will not be more than one hour of cleaning.

I would have shared concerns had I know that we had to pay the full amount at the time of the booking and that we would be paying a 10-percent fee on top of that. Not only does that make a pricey place a bad bargain, but I do not understand how air b and b can effectively assert regarding the five-percent fee to the owner that the company offers someone who rents a place for $200/night twice as much service as a homeowner who rents a place out for $100/night.

For that matter, the booker paying the 10-percent fee does not get any more service from air b and b for renting the $200 place than the $100 one.

I did express fairly strong concern to my partner on learning of the cancellation fee. I pointed out that we are out all that money in the event that weather, a mechanical problem with the plane, sickness, a family emergency, etc. requires not taking the trip, (Even the not-so-friendly airlines merely charge a large fee if we do not travel and seem to use some discretion regarding imposing that penalty.) 

I also noted that we could have stayed in a nice hotel with a location that is as good as our air b and b place, good amenities, daily maid services, and other perks (and would not have required paying anything in advance and would not have charged us if we had cancelled the reservation the day before) for the same total amount that we are paying for the air b and b place.

One suggestion regarding all this is that air b and b do a better job making its policies prominent; these terms should prominently pop up when you enter search terms and should require that you affirmatively click an icon to proceed.

I was promoting the service to friends in the process of researching a place but now am more vocal in warning people against it.

The final bit of fairness to air b and b is that the service may make sense for a family or two couples traveling together who need a full kitchen and/or two or more sleeping areas. It also may make sense for a long-term stay. It definitely does not make sense for a couple or a single person traveling for a week or less.",1,"“In fairness to air b and b, I only have an upcoming...” "

When I got to what I thought was the end? Well NOTHING! I got no confirmation that they had my information or that I had a reservation. Just nothing. So I went to FAQ which didn't help at all. I contacted the owner who said they had not received confirmation of payment and to maybe try tech support. I looked for Tech support but guess what? Nothing! I clicked on ""Contact"" but that took me back to the bottom of the page. To make a long, annoying story short, I kept going around in circles to no avail. I checked what I assumed was my status and it had ""Verify me"" still there as if I had not just provided  my life's history and information so I clicked it again and yup, you guessed it.Nothing. This went on for about 45 or so minuets while I tried to contact someone. I finally gave up and tried to call the owner back but no one answered the phone so I hit the big cancel button and moved on to another cabin that does not use this system.

Oh he said, sometimes that is a problem. I said well maybe you should say something at the beginning of your site about only chrome users need apply. He also informed me that the phone icon was for people with ""Real emergencies"".  I also informed him, that their site directly cost his client a four day reservation and that I would not book with any company in the future that uses them. It was obvious he couldn't care less.

Although we did book with a host from airbnb, the host forgot to mention that machinery and noise in the surrounding area of the Waikiki townhouse is constant and one is unable to get away from it for a moment. We had the possibility of a hurricane coming our way so were advised to leave three days ahead but our host simply said, ""tough luck!""....I would NEVER do that again.

675,"DO NOT book with AirBnB. I never do this kind of thing (ranting online about anything) but this NEEDS to be shared so no one else gets $#*!ed over like i did! i used AirBnB for the first time to book a few places in Europe in June (which alone was enough to never want to use them again, a lot of hidden fees etc, and a lot of issues including getting hacked twice, but with no repercussions - luckily...) and then did not use it since. Then about two weeks ago, apparently someone hacked my account and made around 5 reservations bookings to places in London! My credit card was charged over $8,000 (!!!!!!!) of reservations I did not make! Visa said that since i did 'originally' provide my credit card to them (in JUNE, for certain transactions THEN...), it was my fault and would have to be dealt with AirBnB. It was an absolute NIGHTMARE trying to deal with AirBnB, no one could give me a clear answer as to what was going on or the status of my 'reservations' which I obviously immediately wanted to cancel - i was lied to about refunds several times (""oh yes you will be refunded immediately, check your account in a few hours"" - HA.) and I had to BEG BEG BEG them daily to refund me (they finally did bit by bit) - absolutely terrible customer service, they are SO eager to hang up on you and clearly don't want to help. Calling them is a big inconvenience for them it appears (and have you noticed how hard it is to find their phone number?? I dare you, try to find it on their site.) The worst is that for the first 4 days (and me calling every day) I had to literally YELL at someone, and then they told me no one had even been assigned to my case yet but that it would be taken care of ""soon"" and I'd be contacted. I never was, not even once. No email, no call. I had to constantly be calling them and beg THEM to fix their $#*!ing stupid mistakes. Also - did you know that once you enter a credit card, it STAYS in the system? You have NO way of deleting it. I finally demanded my account be shut down immediately. I can't log in now, so I *think* it might be shut down but I keep getting notifications about bookings in London, so clearly they did not fully shut it down. So sketchy, and again, huge lack of respect for members. This site is an absolute $#*!ing joke and a mess, they are completely unsafe and offer no care or support whatsoever to members. ESPECIALLY in an emergency/crisis situation - instead, they choose the old 'ignore and hope everything goes away' philosophy. I strongly, strongly recommend never using this site!!!! If you think it saves you tons of money, straight up it DOES NOT. Just stay in a hotel - you won't have to deal with this bull$#*! unsafe sketchy site, you don't have to talk to or deal with any creeps (or 'hosts' as they like to call them), you don't have to pay random fees that they decide to charge you (""oh, you're not renting a 4 bedroom villa by yourself? We'll have to charge you extra for each guest plus, an extra cleaning fee then!"" - Airbnb), just BE SAFE, be comfortable, and me smart - stay in a hotel. Or hostel.

In September 2014, we rented a condo from Airbnb for 6 nights. . It was represented to us as a luxury condo with a view of ........ The price was $2,500

Here is a list of the problems we encountered during our brief stay.

1.  The toilet in the guest bathroom was running constantly. It never stopped the whole time we were there.  On the second day, the toilet bowl would not refill unless I took the top off and moved a few parts around.  Had to be done every time the toiled was flushed.  Maintenance came up and got it to refill but not stop running about every 45 seconds.  They said the whole inside needing replacing.  This never happened and toilet was running when we left.  The whole 6 days!!

2.  The light over the vanity in the same bathroom was out.  This was fixed 2 days later.

3. A table light in the living room had a short in it. I didn't fix it but got it to work.

4.  On day 4, we went to use the Washer only to find it full of dirty, stinky water that would not drain out.  When we entered the condo on the first day, we found 3 bags of dirty laundry on the floor of utility room.  It was removed and we didn't pay any more attention to it.  After we tried to use the Washer and found it full of the stale water, we figured out why the dirty laundry was on the floor.  Someone knew the Washer was broken when we moved in but did nothing about it. We were told it would be fixed but along with everything else, it was not.  We were able to use the small washer in a unit 9 floors up and at the other end of the hall from ours.  Had to make 4/5 trips to complete the wash. 

5.  Last but not least, The view out the bedroom window was of the roof level of the parking garage and the view out of the living room area was a continuation of the parking garage roof full of cigarette butts and garbage.  Looked like it had not been cleaned in years.

680,The first time I used AirBnB it was fine - we arranged a room at short notice and it all went smoothly. Since then I've tried multiple times and I've always been rejected by the hosts - despite having a positive rating. Hosts don't usually even provide a reason. I was hoping to use AirBnB instead of a hotel or hostel but that really doesn't work if it's unreliable.,1,“The first time I used AirBnB it was fine” 
681,"*****DO NOT USE AIRBNB@@@ Here are reasons why;

1. Airbnb does not do proper precreening or check up on condition of the rooms/places as they leave it to their ""hosts"" to provide rooms for their guests in whatever the condition hosts feel is proper. I once checked into a room where kitchen was filled with crawling maggots! My wife and I had to clean up the place we paid to stay for 4 days as Airbnb failed to help! She basically paid her money to Airbnb to clean the kitchen and rest of the stanger's apartment during her vacation!

2. Airbnb Customer Service Reps are almost nonexistent. You can hardly EVER get anyone on the phone. If you somehow ever do, person on the phone sounds terribly undertrained. No help at all other than keep aplogizing for their failures.

3. Airbnb will secure your payment FIRST then try to resolve any problems whilst holding your funds hostage. For example, if you ever try booking and transaction does not go through, it will still hold your money more than a month on a canceled reservation. You have to call and email them more than two, three dozen times, begging them, to give you your own money back. They admited they have some flaws in their payment system, but these flaws only come in play when it comes to refunds, not when it comes to taking your money.

4. Horrific verification process- even AFTER you log on to your own accout, have your reservation accepted and have your bookings FULLY PAID FOR, Airbnb will STILL demand you to enter your personal information such as last four digits of your SSN, date of birth, address and oh yeah, SCANNED COPIES OF TWO GOVERNMENT ISSUED IDs online. If you don't upload your IDs onto their website, they will LOCK YOU OUT from seeing any of your existing reservations, even ones you AREADY PAID FOR IN FULL. Sure, they ""promise"" their website is very secure, but don't they all say such until there is a major breach and hacked into? Can you REALLY trust them with ALL your personal information such as following?
1. Last 4 digits of your SSN
2. Date of Birth
3. Address
4. 2 forms of Government Issued IDs

Am I buying a house? I am just merely trying to rent a place to stay! I don't know any other travel website that demands so much of your personal information that should be protected at all costs, do you?

To try regain the booking I asked my daughter-in-law to make the booking for me.

This shows that whoever writes their web software is only interested in the 18 to 20 year olds with the latest technology.  The software engineer's manager should be informed of his narrow window of conception and operation.

Most websites manage to accommodate ALL operating systems without marginalising old fashion software platforms, or else their market would shrink.

Fully agreed with some of the comments given on this site - appalling customer service. One day out of the blue my account was disabled for no reason. I tried to call them to (1) understand what happened and (2) reinstate the listing as everyday of it not being active costs me reservations and $. Customer service line was always busy, and I ended up waiting on the phone for 30min for what must have been 10 calls to a US number within the course of 2 days (I am based in the UK). The reason why I had to call them 10 times is because half the time the person I was on the phone with was clueless about what was going on (more than one of them was adamant to me that my account was still up and running - and only after 10 minutes of closer look or so realised that actually yes it was disabled!). In addition, the whole process was hugely opaque - all they could do was to pass on your ""case"" to ""a specialist department"" to investigate. I never heard anything meaningful from this ""specialist department"" - they sent me back an email saying the account had been reinstated (without an explanation as to why it had happened in the first place) but when I checked it turned out it was still disabled. Appalled, I called back (and waited on the line for 30min again) to only find myself back in the original helpless explaining - waiting process. Nothing has been resolved or updated since.

Worst is the attitude of some of these call-centre people: When I expressed my concern that, because I can't even access my account and because the whole incident has been such a bad experience, I may consider delisting the place to avoid getting into the same trouble in the future, the lady on the line cheekily said ""you don't have to stay with us - but if you cancel your future reservations we will charge you penalties"". Helpful, isn't it? Considering I can't even *manage* my future reservations not being able to log into my profile. How am I to welcome my next guest in a few days when my account is disabled? Is it fair that they took down my business AND fine me for not being able to accommodate my guests?

But seriously, having thought about all the risks, the trouble of going through all of this again, and the appalling attitude of this company, the $200 cancellation penalty fee seems utterly small. I have decided that it's not worth it - so bye bye Airbnb, never again.

703,"Hello,
I'm replying to this forum Airbnb experience.  I went to this site based on previous recommendations from friends to book a rental home in Italy.  This was my first and only time booking on this service.  I emailed several hosts to find out further information on variety of properties before I booked. I wanted to be sure of the location information and misc details that they listed on their homes.  I received responses from everyone I contacted within 24 -48 hrs.  I chose the property that I was planning to book, which looked amazing on the pictures, and a great price.  Once I contacted the host, he replied back to me stating he was out of the country, and that I should contact his listing agent/consultant to find further details. He provided me with the email address which was ""someones name@consultant-airbnb.com).  I didn't think anything of it, and contacted this person to ask further details on the property and to confirm the dates I needed.  I received a response very quickly with the airbnb logo in the email from that email, stating it was ""team airbnb"".  He confirmed the dates availability and told me to go ahead book the reservation on the site, provide my cc info, and then he will send me a separate invoice for the confirmation with further details and instructions.  I followed this email and booked on airbnb with my credit card.  After the booking was complete, I received another email from airbnb stating the confirmation of the reservation, and that they would follow up with the host to confirm availability.  I then received the email from ""booking@airbnb"" also with response and instructions, providing me with an invoice of the reservation.  The email stated that they canceled my reservation, but not to worry, the property is still reserved for me, but since the owner doesn't take a cc, I need to pay in cash by wiring them the money to the agent that represents the property.  The agent will hold on to the money until 24 hrs prior to us checking in.  The instructions on the invoice gave all the bank information, along with a UK phone number to contact for any questions on how to wire the money.  I also had to pay an additional $500 deposit on top of my rental.  Total cost of the property rental including deposit was for $2729 (US $).  I didn't wire the money right away, since I was traveling on business.  I received an update email from ""airbnb"" stating that I needed to reserve the property within 24 hrs, and if didn't proceed with the wire, my reservation would be canceled.  Being unfamiliar with this site, and the typical procedures, I got nervous, and didn't want to lose the property, so I proceeded to follow the instructions, even called the phone number provided to verify I was speaking with an airbnb agent in UK.  He told me on the phone that he is an agent of Airbnb, and he works out of the UK office, even provided me with their location in CA.  He reassured me that all will be ok, once they receive my wire, they will further confirm the reservation and I will also get the $500 deposit back once we check out.  
Once the wire transfer was complete, I continued to correspond with the ""agent"" and gave him confirmation of the transfer.  He said it usually takes 3-4 days, but he did email me back and was happy to see that it took less time then that. 
Within a day of the completed wire funds, the listing ""disappeared"" from airbnb site, and I was no longer able to access the listing, nor the photos of the property.  Also all my communication emails were not on the airbnb site with the host or his ""agent""  The only email that showed was the initial one that I was told to contact another email address.  Also it did show the airbnb reservation as being ""canceled"".
This is where I started to get suspicious, and emailed the agent again, asking about why the reservation showed canceled? They responded with ""not to worry"" they are having issues w/their servers, and it will be fixed in the next few days but for me to be assured that they have my info and have my reservation booked.  
At this point I started to get further leary, and researched further properties in Positano, and found the same exact photos of the property I booked on other sites.  I of course got concerned, thinking that the home we rented was really not the home, and that the pics were being randomly copied and posted.  At this point, I still thought that I had the home reserved, but was just thinking it was a different home than the photos posted.  I contacted the ""agent"" as well as the host/owner on airbnb asking for the physical address of the property and asked them to email me pictures again.  I received a response 2-3 days later with the property address, as well as additional photos of the property, again with their apologies for delay in replying as well as stating my reservation is still valid.
At this time, I started researching reviews online on airbnb in general and came onto tons of scam alerts, as well as exactly the same situations and previous scams that I went thru.  
I did contact airbnb in CA immediately once I realized what was happening.  I spoke two different times to 2 different official Airbnb customer service agents, who were very nice, apologetic and assured me that they will investigate further into the matter.  Since this all transpired during a holiday weekend, it may take an extra day to get back to me.  I filed a case/claim with airbnb on Saturday as an urgent claim.  I received an automated email response giving me their anti trust/policies and scam alerts. This was not clearly stated on their site when I initially signed up for an account though.
In the meantime, I also contacted my US bank to do a wire recall to attempt to get my money back.  I'm waiting now for further updates from my bank if they will be able to retrieve any of the funds from the UK banks.  I'm also still waiting back from airbnb on my claim.

The long winded review, is  hopefully a warning to all reading this, and first time users of airbnb, to not do what I did, and do not wire any funds.  The emails are very deceptive, and they look very legit!  They all have some form of airbnb in the emails, also copied all their logos, and really are professional.  This to me looks like a sophisticated scam operation.  I am extremely distraught that I fell for it.  

If any one of you who is reading this, got your money back and was able to pursue this in legal matter, please please contact me.  I would love to hear any feedback or advice on this.

thank you for reading!

704,"So so disappointing!  Needed housing for the month of may in NYC. First reservation taken and paid but three weeks before move in received a cancellation with no reason. Made a second reservation and also paid in full, just received an other automated cancellation again,,  supposed to move in in 2 days. How can this be allowed. There is no accountability and no one to talk to and no cancellation reason given. This leaves me stranded in ny to start work on Monday. I can't believe a reputable place would allow this. I even had an appointment to meet a person to get set up in the room. Two days to find replacement housing.   Bad bad business!!
Will NEVER consider using or recommending airbnb again.",1,“So so disappointing!”

A few days after getting home i received an email from AIRBNB saying they have released my $250 deposit and it would show up in my account within a week. I never received it so i contacted airbnb and they claimed that it should be there and this is now my banks problem. I contacted my bank who said this was airbnb's problem. When i contacted airbnb again they were apologetic and said that they themselves had contacted my bank and everything should be fine, of course it was not! My bank NEVER received anything from them! I told airbnb this and they sent me some letter that they apparently sent my bank saying that they have in fact allowed me to receive my deposit back, my bank said they would give me a temp amount until they got the proof from airbnb. 
It is now APRIL! and i just got charged the original amount on my credit card again ($1620) which included the deposit!! because my bank never received proof that they were giving me back this deposit....i called airbnb to file a complaint and the guy i spoke with said hed have to send it to a different department because he cannot deal with something like this at his position and the department he's sending it to has NO PHONE NUMBER!!! NO PHONE NUMBER???!! A WELL KNOWN INTERNET BUSINESS COLLECTING PEOPLES MONEY AND THEY DONT HAVE A PHONE NUMBER?!? He claimed i will receive an email from them and i can tell them whats going on there...UM NO I DO NOT WANT TO TALK TO ""A PERSON"" VIA EMAIL, I WANT TO SPEAK TO AN ACTUAL PERSON AND FIND OUT WHERE MY $250 IS!!!! ....I DO NOT RECOMMEND AIRBNB!!! -TERRIBLE",1,“I booked a place in New Orleans in october for a stay...”

The place worked out  fine but when it came to getting our deposit back which they assured us had been done a day after checking out it has been nothing but hassle.  They charged my card the full amount and included the deposit and try telling me that they never charged the deposit to the card.  My credit card company said they had to do a credit , they couldn't just cancel the part that was the deposit.  I must of corresponded with 7 different customer service people who just did not get that concept.  It's over 4 months and still not received the $300 deposit back to my card.

I recently started hosting and had bookings almost every night. After a month of having herds of strangers going through my flat, washing sheets, cleaning and waiting on them  I still haven't had any payments released to me by Airbnb....
Many expensive calls to their US office later and talking to many totally incompetent members of staff all I have is assurances that they are dealing with the problem. 
In the meantime, I am forced to cancel all the reservations I have through them, which means that some of my potential guests will have no place to sleep when they arrive to London. 
I am fairly certain that nobody in Airbnb is going to help them, as in my experience ""24/7"" and ""local contact number"" are a myth - you can only really get to talk to a human on the US number, during US office hours, after 7-12 minutes of being kept on hold only to get to speak to some American kid who sounds a bit retarded.

If not an ordinary booking taking place - any slight modification on the booking request throw the whole thing in disarray. The customer service is below the poor. To reach them by phone - impossible, by email - upto 48 hours, and then you will get a kid giving you a lecture on how to operate their site. Then, after 6-8 exchanges, when screenshot being sent to them to prove that the magic button they sending you to is not there, they will say ""Ohhh"" and send it to the technical guys to sort it out. And that is endless with them. They take a pose to get upset with you if you are upset with them. They are polite, but mostly incompetent and will never admit to the site's malfunctions. And, finally, they take a big advantage of charging travelers 100% upfront and holding their money sometimes 6 months or more! Money should work. I think they are working only for Airbnb and not for the host. They are doomed. They are living their heydays, but they will not survive - this business is being re-arnged under pressure from governments and many hosts are seeking better representations, while travelers looking for more security.

I booked two accommodations for six of us (three married couples) traveling to Ireland in late August 2014.  Both of the reservations were accepted and I furnished payment for same in the amount of $2301.00 on November 15, 2013.  I think that bound both Airbnb & me contractually. The reservations I paid for was for a trip we planned for August of 2014. I was informed it was ""Company Policy"" that trips had to be paid for when bookedeven when that far in advance

On January 20, 2014, some two months later, I received an e-mail from the host of one of the accommodations through Airbnb, cancelling my confirmed and paid for accommodations in Dublin for Aug 28-30. She claimed some misunderstanding on the dates that I had requested.  She suggested another property and even went so far as to ask the host of that property to hold the space for us.  Upon investigation I found it to be unsuitable since it had only two bedrooms and a hide-a-bed.

Since then I have made numerous contacts withairbnb company by telephone and e-mail.  The e-mails were always answered by an automated response that made vague (& unfulfilled) promises of resolution. My telephone contacts, when I was able to wait long enough to get through the queue, were equally unproductive. I was often told that ""senior management"" was working on a solution and I would hear from them soon.  The latest contact I had with your company was with an employee named Mitzi on 2-14/14. She said that the company had issued a refund for the cancelled/paid for reservation. I checked my AMEX account and no refund from Airbnb was posted.  The representative then said that an e-mail addressing the situation had been sent. To date I have received no such e-mail. I asked for a mailing address for your company.  After checking with someone, Mitzi unbelievably stated that she could not give out the address and that I should Google it. I also told Mitzi that I was unable to respond to the automated e-mails sent by your company. Her answer was that I should change my browser which I found an astonishing response to a customer service question.",1,“I have a continuing problem as a consequence of a reservatio...” 
719,"Avoid - no safeguarding to hosts & poor customer support:
I am a host and listed my apartment. Very quickly it was generating enquiries.
Someone booked it, they wanted that day for a total of 4 nights. I followed all the procedures at Airbnb accepting the request. 4 hours later I met up with the guests and they moved in.
8 hours later I get an automated email from Airbnb saying the reservation has been cancelled by Airbnb as they believe this particular guest may be behaving fraudulently. Payment had also not gone through.
That left me with guests in my apartment on a cancelled reservation! I then emailed Airbnb basically asking for advice and what had gone wrong? I thought maybe it was just a mistake with credit card details or something?
I also raised a safety concern through the website again asking for details and advice.
The response to these was just an automated acknowledgement email with no other answers. Further to this, it is now 24 hours later and still Airbnb have not got back to me via either methods of communication.
 The ironic thing is it says on their website in big letter that they have 24hours customer services?!!!
Whilst it isn't there fault that the guest is possible fraudulent, they should of have contacted me much quicker via telephone rather than just an email at 5 in the morning the following day. They have cancelled the reservation which means you can no longer access any contact details of in fact correspondence of the guest. They should also verify the payment details of guests immediately when the reservation is accepted.
The result of all this was I had guests in my apartment that should not be there. I went round to see them and they fobbed me off. I asked for a cash payment and they hadn't got any money. I had a well built' friend to hand and luckily they left peacefully!

After we made payment, we got the address of the apartment. When I checked the address on Google Maps we I found out to our dismay that the building was located in a very narrow and dark street with bordered up store front and shuttered windows. The area did not look safe. Everything was covered in graffiti and the entrance was located across from a building where the trash cans were collected. We tried to cancel the reservation.

722,"I was recently scammed for over 1500 USD by a fraudulent posting for an apartment in London on the AIRBNB site. I share much of the blame for this as I went outside of the AIRBNB site to communicate with the prospective host.  But I am not inexperienced with AIRBNB, nor do I consider myself uneducated when it comes to internet buying.  However I felt safe with this prospective host and I feel that I felt safe communicating off-site with this host largely because of some conflicting policies and procedures that AIRBNB uses.   I am concerned that AIRBNB has become successful enough to be targeted by sophisticated scam artists who mimic the AIRBNB website, language and page formatting.  This included using the AIRBNB name in fraudulent email addresses and on fraudulent bank accounts.  Unfortunately, at least in my experience, I don´t feel that AIRBNB is doing enough to police it´s site, and to provide a safe and trustworthy format for connecting hosts with guests.  After more effort than I think appropriate in my circumstance, I finally was able to contact AIRBNB to first confirm that the reservation I thought I had made was fraudulent, and then secondly to lodge my complaint and concern over this event.  The response I received in both cases expressed regret for my experience but was focused mainly on indemnifying AIRBNB from any responsibility.  It is of course common in cases of fraud to blame the victim for lack of vigilance, but AIRBNB has been disturbingly uninterested in my experience, how I might have been led to feel safe with this posting, or how a multiple user might be confused by the policies of AIRBNB.  At this point it is my feeling that prospective users of AIRBNB must be extremely cautious with any connections that are made through this site.  Hopefully AIRBNB will place effort and resources into making their site safer for users.  I have been a very happy user of their site and think that their business model is very interesting, but with their success comes the responsibility to be more proactive to protect users from site predators.  It isn´t enough to claim to be a third party platform user anymore.  They need to up their game when it comes to user trust and security.",1,“I was recently scammed for over 1500 USD by a fraudulent...”

I stayed in an unacceptable hosting environment (there was no heat in sub-zero temperatures, in one of the coldest nights in history according to weather.com) and while AirBnB kindly refunded me, they also asked me to post a review of the host to ""keep AirBnB honest."" 

I hesitated, as last time I posted a less-than-favorable review, the host retaliated and posted completely false and damaging things on my profile. I was able to get it removed by removing my original review, and I see the host continues to do the same things to anyone who makes any kind of complaint on her property. 

However, the host seemed relatively nice/stable so I posted a fair but honest review of my experience. The host went nuts, calling me (as well as my friend who stayed with me) twice a day, harassing us to take the review down, and when I asked her to stop calling me, she sent me multiple messages via AirBnB, and even after AirBnB asked her to stop calling me, she continued to harass me. 

She then went the extra mile and wrote a false, damaging, and defaming review on my profile. I contacted AirBnB and asked them to take action, or at least to remove the review on my page. They responded in a fairly sarcastic way, saying that while they were removing parts of MY review because it referenced some of the actions of the AirBnB staff (such as the fact that they gave me a refund), they would not remove any parts of the host's review. Nor were they taking any further action about the fact that this woman was harassing me-- so I'm guessing she will have free reign in the future to harass customers who don't completely agree with the substandard conditions of her property. They ended the email with a snarky ""I'm sure you'll get great reviews in the future"" and basically put the blame on my friend and I. 

By the way, after some further research, I see that this host has done this with MULTIPLE people who wrote less than favorable reviews. She slandered them on their profile page in very similar language as on our page. So this is not a unique circumstance to us, yet AirBnB continues to allow her to do this. 

The fact that I am being harassed because I posted a fair and balanced review outlining the facts of a host that offered an unacceptable hosting situation and AirBnB chooses to protect the host tells you all you need to know. Sure, if you are in a good situation with AirBnB, you'll be fine, but the minute you need protection, you are screwed. Don't bother. It is not worth the headache or money saved.

However, there was one negative incident where the cleaner came into our room to ask us when we were checking out a day before we were scheduled to do so. Even though the review I left on Air BnB was mainly positive, because I mentioned this one negative fact, the host told the Air BnB community we had left the apartment in a mess and we should not be rented to. Strange that we have never had such problems in any cities in the world for the last thirty years or so. I am considering taking legal action against the host for defamation of character. What I do know is that Air BnB clearly has unscrupulous people like this that do not take valid criticism in their stride. Instead they lie to an international community of people to say you left the apartment in a mess and did not treat it well when the exact opposite is true and when additional items were left there at our expense for future guests.

After reporting a booking to them with a host that clearly violated their guest policy (she had listed her property with a fraudulent address - her building was across the street from the actual listing, was lacking amenities that she claimed to have and gave me a room that was cluttered and messy - the farthest thing from the photos on their site) they decided that a compromise was in order and gave me only a partial refund for my trouble. This was after they promised me a replacement room to make up for the fraudulent one I could not use.

739,"Do not use Airbnb. As you can read from other reviews, Airbnb provides no guarantee that the property you rent (or think that you rent) will really be available to you when you arrive, and provides essentially nothing to you when the owner does arbitrarily cancel your rental contract. 
A month ago, I booked an apartment in NYC, through Airbnb, for a long weekend in mid-December. Several days ago Airbnb notified me that the owner had cancelled the contract, with a 'sincere apology' and $50 (less than they charge for their service fee) available toward our next reservation tho only if we spend more than the current refund value. The property I had rented had a cancellation policy stating that I would only receive a 50% refund if I cancelled; Airbnb failed to provide or honor any such protection for me. When I contacted Airbnb, they refused to provide anything more than $50 in credit toward another reservation, and that only if I spent more than I had originally.
When I rent a place (and pay in advance, in full), I expect the property to be available. Sure, sometimes things happen and the owner will need to cancel, but Airbnb should then take steps to demonstrate they recognize the massive inconvenience and annoyance and make it right. Airbnb failed to do that. I will never use them again, and strongly encourage others to avoid them.",1,“Do not use Airbnb”

Users beware - be sure you know what you are getting yourself into when using this site. I have spent hours on the phone and via email with my host as well as airbnb (not to mention my host spent an hour on the phone with an airbnb representative.

To make matters worse, the website is an absolute nightmare to navigate. And 12% 'service fees.' That's the biggest joke of all.

At this point, I'm incredibly disappointed with the lack of transparency, clear information and ethical business practices of airbnb. I will never use this service again.

Any host thinking of renting their home would, under normal circumstances, take all sorts of precautions. Airbnb encourages a more relaxed attitude and offers some liability cover to ease any doubts.

Any guest booking from some random stranger via email would be very wary of handing over money. On airbnb you can be lulled by the community atmosphere into being less careful.

What airbnb really need to do is tighten up their systems to ensure hosts know what they may be getting into, and to guide guests in  way that makes it very difficult for the dodgy hosts and outright scammers to operate.

Since being scammed via a fraudulent listing on the site I've seen numerous reports and reviews from other guests and hosts with similar experiences. There are two common themes:

1. I thought I was safe - the whole airbnb experience encourages this feeling
2. Airbnb customer service don't care - maybe they do if it's a simple wrinkle to iron out but if you have real problems be prepared for overwhelming indifference

Personally I'm avoiding airbnb until I see evidence that they take more serious care how they vet hosts. If I were considering hosting I'd do some serious research on protecting my property and would probably go with a local property management company.

Unlike most retailers and services, there is no way to look up your gift card information.  Your balances may be eliminated without any compensation and you will have to fight to get this credit back.  If you use a gift card and the 1st payment is less than the gift card, you will lose the balance.  It cannot be applied to the 2nd payment  according to 2 different phone reps. and several different online reps.  You must select to pay a balance that is greater than the gift card.  Heaven only knows how difficult it is to be credited with a gift card balance in the case of a cancellation by the host, due to weather difficulties or ill health.

Check reviews and pay particular attention to past cancellations by the host.  In many locations, it would be extremely difficult to find an alternative booking in high season.  Sometimes hosts have the property for sale and they will cancel if it is sold.  Ask them, especially if it is high season and an in demand location.
The other issue is that the price shown on the location map will vary greatly from in season prices and actual prices for your dates.
Look for lots of reviews to give an overall picture of the acceptability of the property.",2,“Gift card users BEWARE and BE AWARE”

But I was unable to search for a room using the search function do I left the site. Apparently it's not for renting rooms anymore. It wased my time.",2,“can't find room on website” 
776,"The fastest way to know what kind of site it is your dealing with in my opinion is to go right past the welcoming page and straight to their help section.  I do appreciate not having to contact CS by having a quality group of FAQs but often times I seem to be the one that falls through the cracks and though I am diligent about searching FAQs (because I don't have a lot of faith in CS in the first place) ,   there are times when contacting CS is the only option. 
This proved to be the case with my experience with Airbnb.com .   I can't tell you how the rooms were,  although  I suspect that would be a place by place circumstance in this case.  The reason I can't tell you is because although I have legal state issued drivers license;  I was unable to get a photo of it which was good enough to satisfy their ID check system at airbnb.com.   Had that been just the case,  it would have been simply dropped from my mind as I continued my search to find a place to take a hot date I had been lucky enough to arrange.  I am also of limited finances which was the reason I didn't just get a hotel room in the first place but before I left airbnb.com I noticed there was a second option to arrange getting my room,  which stated that you didn't need to provide your ID to their system,   but the caveat was that you might lose your reservation to someone who had in the meantime went through their process of checking ID successfully.  I decided that sounds fair so I went through their process of taking my money and after having done all that I expected to be taken to a page saying when I would be contacted or where I had to go or something with instructions on what I needed to do next.  Needless to say I was less than thrilled when it took me to their ID cheeking system page once again and it stated I needed to prove my ID.  
Now the site had my money and I didn't have funds to just go on and worry about it later after my date.  So I contacted both the owner of the place I was suppose to be renting and airbnb.com,  this however only after going round and round on their website trying to find the link I needed to actually contact a human being.  

All together  I lost about  four hours time before I got a message stating that my money was refunded.    The owner of the property I was suppose to be renting did finally contact me that day with an oh-so helpful statement saying he couldn't accept my reservation until I had satisfied airbnb.com's identity checking system.

The only reason  I didn't give airbnb.com a lower rating is because I didn't want to scare somebody who might need lodging at a somewhat lower rate than most hotels,  because the truth is it might have been a wonderful stay had I been able to satisfy their ID check system.

This is fair warning to anyone that can't afford to have their money tied up or that might have any sort of special cause for contacting airbnb.com because I don't think you will get a reply in a timely fashion if at all.",2,“Another Hide The CS Link Type Of Site.”

778,"Travel Nightmare Extraordinaire.

My wife decided to run in the 2017 New York Marathon.  She invited several members of her family to join us in New York City for a family trip over the long marathon weekend.  With a total of seven people in our group, we realized we needed lodging that had five bedrooms, at least two (if not three) bathrooms, was conveniently located, and affordable by everyone in our party.  Thats quite a tall order, so our search began more than two months prior to the marathon weekend, at which time we booked this place through Air BnB.  Subsequent communications with the host were somewhat strange, as we heard from several different people on several different occasions, and in the days just before our scheduled arrival, we were given two different house numbers as the exact location, which we also found to be rather odd.  The host did, indeed, send an email to confirm the reservation on the day before our scheduled arrival.
While riding on a bus that was just a few miles away from entering Manhattan to begin our big family weekend, my wife received a phone call from someone (yet another different person) who claimed to represent the host of this lodging location.  Shockingly, she was told that we could NOT check into the apartment as scheduled because there are guests in there now who refuse to leave.  The man on the phone began to offer us some alternative locations that he claimed he had available, none of which were of a size, type, and location that was remotely similar to what we had reserved with them more than two months prior.  Since my bus was about to go into a tunnel to enter the city, I told the caller that I did not want to discuss this on the telephone, and asked that we meet in person.  He said hed call me back.
Less than fifteen minutes later, the other members of my wifes family had arrived at the bus station shortly before we did, and we all met inside the terminal and broke the bad news to them.  While doing so, my wife received a text messageless than a half-hour before we were supposed to check into our reserved apartmentinforming her that our host had cancelled our reservation.  Imagine: seven people standing in a bus station, all of whom had made plans months in advance and traveled from Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and Atlantic City, had arrived in New York City, only to learn that what they thought was a secured lodging arrangement no longer existed and we had no place to go.  This, on a weekend when many hundreds of thousands of people were arriving for a major sporting event, making available lodging a precious commodity.  Naturally, having yet to receive a return phone call from the man who telephoned less than a half-hour before, we then called Air BnB.  The agent was very nice, telling us that the host had to cancel our reservation because of a gas leak, an explanation quite different than the story we heard shortly before!
Sparing you the details of the multiple, long-duration phone calls with Air BnB, the agent was eventually able to acquire for us last-minute accommodations at a house that, while lovely, was in Brooklyn, fully twelve miles from our originally-reserved mid-town Manhattan location!  Air BnB graciously offered to pay for our transportation to the Brooklyn house as a bit of compensation for what we were enduring.
Picture seven peopleamong whom was my 82-year-old father-in-law with bad legs and other medical issues, and his wife who is battling the effects of ovarian cancer treatmentnow forced to take lengthy subway rides and long walks to do what they THOUGHT would have been done by easy strolls from a conveniently-located midtown Manhattan location! In addition, the added expenses in both transit times and money were significant.
Customer reviews of Air BnB lodging experiences are, for the most part, SUBJECTIVE evaluations provided by the guest traveler.  However, in this particular case, my review is NOT subjective! It is OBJECTIVE and FACTUAL.  Everything I have shared here is documented and can be verified by Air BnB and copies of emails, text messages, etc.  Overall, the weekend began terribly and was followed by many difficult challenges that were not anticipated by everyone involved.
We suspect that the host had found guests who were willing to pay more for the lodging than we had committed, and simply cancelled our reservation in order to make more money from a different party.  We cant be certain that was the case, but no other explanation seems plausible.  I share this experience to warn potential Air BnB customers that this sort of situation can not be prevented, and if it does occur, you have absolutely no recourse.  Air BnB may help you find other lodging, but they will not and can not compensate you for the loss of money and significant inconvenience.  
Air BnB has certainly provided very good lodging experiences for millions of people, but be forewarned: there is nothing in place that can prevent an incident such as Ive just shared from happening again to other people.  Unfortunately, in instances such as this, no compensation can be had, and no review of the host can be posted because the reservation was cancelled by the host and the stay never occurred.  The host reneged on their commitment, and there is no way of posting feedback so that other potential guests can be forewarned.",2,“Travel Nightmare Extraordinaire”

I think Airbnb should be illigal. You cant buy a house and advertise it as a hotel. Zoning laws exists to prevent this, it's unfair to those without homes as well as business owners. Nowadays you book an air bnb home and it's realy  an apartment some college kids are renting out, and business travelers have more money than the city folk do and price becomes so astronomically high one to one has to work 2 jobs 15 hours a day just to afford a roof for the night, hell you cant even buy a house real estate moguls are now even in for the steal.

782,"On the 11th of March, I booked an apartment in Poland. The response of the host was that the price was higher for the period (Christmas) that I booked. 

I filled a complaint at Airbnb stating that the EU Directive for Consumer Rights does not allow traders to change prices. It states: ""Traders are obliged to display correct and complete pricing information before a customer makes a purchase online"". 

Additionally, Article 7.12. of the terms and conditions of Airbnb for hosts states:""You are solely responsible for setting a price (including any Taxes if applicable) for your Listing (Listing Fee). Once a Guest requests a booking of your Listing, you may not request that the Guest pays a higher price than in the booking request.""

Nevertheless, Airbnb responds that no sales has been made due to the fact that the host provided me with an alternative proposal. Also, they mentioned that it is unfortunate, that no all of their hosts are aware of the ability to change prices a year in advance. 

My conclusion: the tools are their for the hosts, the terms and conditions clearly states that hosts are responsible for showing the right price, nevertheless, Airbnb does not protect it's users when hosts violate the law and their own terms and conditions.",2,“Airbnb doesn't protect the rights of it's users”

789,"I've used AirBnB four times.  
Two of those times were just fine, and two were awful.  What I particularly did not like, and why I'm blaming AirBnB is that it was their customer service that is awful.  

I can understand, with so many listings, and so many renters, that there will be problems.  But they should go out  of theri way to resolve listings that are fradulent or misleading, and help the stranded customer.  Instead, they have an unacceptably cavalier attitude that is not acceptable.

The first awful one was when I booked a room in Utreckt several months before a conference I was scheduled to attend.  Just by co-incidence, it happened to be the exact same weekend that the world championship soccer tournament was taking place in Utrect. Neither the host nor I knew this would happen when the booking was made. 
A few hours after I checked in, the host was downstairs yukking it up with his friends.  He  then entered my room to tell me that his uncle was sick in the hospital in Germany, he had to leave, and I did, too.  So now I'm stuck in a strange town, with no place to go.  I found a computer, but it was in Dutch, so I could not log on to AirBnB to see about finding another place.  AirBnB takes no responsibility when the hosts leave you in a lurch.  Since he cancelled, I could not write a review.  AirBnB gave me a $25 credit which expired a year after it was issued, so it  went to waste.

The last time I used AirBnB to book a room in Palm Springs, the room was not as it was represented.  I didn't have a thermometer, but the host looked up the temperature on the internet, and she said it was 88 outside, and the room, which had no air conditioning, was hotter than outdoors.  Her website said, ""Do not touch the air conditioning, it is set for 82 degrees.  If you want it colder, I will have to charge more.""  She has since removed the words ""air conditioning"" from her description, but it was there before.  She told us that if we didn't want to sleep in that room, which was tiny and stuffy, we'd have to go somewhere else.  So, 7 at night, after a day of travelling in 90+ degree weather, we have to find a hotel.  I told her I would ask for my money back, and she said she would call in the morning to find out what to do.  

When I got checked in to the hotel, I spend hours trying to find help on AirBnB's site.  I found a resolution center, where I filled in the form, and they said they would give the host 72 hours to respond, and to wait until  then.  Three days later, I went back, and they said that the host accurately described the room, and would not give a refund. I've received several emails since then from AirBnB.  I can't decide if they were computer generated by a program that was poorly written, of it they were written by someone who is semi-literate in English - they were rather confusing, and could not be parsed into exactly what they were saying.  Some said the matter was done, a decision had been made.  Others said, if you are satisfied with this, you need do nothing.  I think that's the jist of the emails - as I said, the writing was very poor - missing verbs and weird sentence structure.  So I wasn't sure if the matter was still open for discussion.  I didn't put in everything in the form I filled out, and if there was a place to add more info, and challend the decision, I wanted to do that, but I saw no way to do that, and earlier emails had said the decision final.

Then I got an email giving me a $97 dollar credit.

I tried this several times, getting the same message, so I waited a day thinking the web site was malfunctioning.

I finally called the Airbnb customer service (had to do a Google search for their phone number since it wasn't anywhere on their web page) and explained my frustration.

Airbnb's customer service is almost non-existent. People are nice but have no idea how the business works. It always takes a lot of time to get any issue resolved becasue they have no experience or the power to resolve the issue (in comparison, VRBO's customer service is much better).

Airbnb is obsessed about the security or, I would say, secrecy. They never share, even after the booking is confirmed, emails or phone numbers. At the same time, they allow booking with a guest that has no name, just a ""user"". How in the world a host should let somebody stay in their property of significant value if the person doesn't even has a name? 

It used to be that if somebody contacts (not a request for booking, but with a question) me via airbnb's conversation, I can reply or do pre-approve (my choice). Now, I don't have a choice: there is no ""reply"". I can only do ""pre-approve"", or ""decline"" or ""make an offer"".
It bothers me because it's rude not to give me a choice and the company comes through as only caring about the bottom line (big fees) and not for their clients.

Then got to the ID verification.Makes sense. However, 1st it could not verify even though my info was in fact accurate. Finally resolved the site said the glitches were due to what they said was site server issues. Check. it then asked to check via access to either facebook, google or LikedIn as an additional verification. I thought ok that seems fair. Looked at what they wanted access to and know enough about data delivery and value of big data accumulation for investor valuations and saw they wanted access to my contacts. Bingo. 
For those who do not know, there is no way that is of any verification or security value. That is simply a fake and ineffective excuse for a pure DATA grab. It is heavily frowned upon and there is a stark division between so Internet based companies that do this kind of data grab cloaked usually in security or verification and those who do not insist on getting access to contacts. 
Let's be clear what that means and why it is such a NONO in the internet business etiquette. It is basically saying you have to give a 3rd party access to the contact info of a friend or business contact of yours WITHOUT their agreement. That is the ethical issue here. 
So I paid for the place that said it was available. Hours later and only one day before I had to arrive, I get a note late at night saying the place was not in fact available so had no other options in time. Hotel started to seem really good... 
Regardless of their current valuation as a company, these two points will eventually cause the company to lose market share. There is no need to require access to contacts. It's a fluff argument giving false  sense of security. Second the turn around process is deeply flawed and unprofessional.

804,"So I just signed up with Airbnb. Requested a condo. No reply, so request got cancelled. I figured maybe the host just didnt have time to reply within the 24hrs. So I requested the same condo again. Luckily, they accepted the second time. Few days later, I received an email and a txt message stating the condo wasn't available for the dates I wanted anymore. I logged onto the Airbnb site and noticed I didnt have any notifications stating it was not available. So I messaged the host through Airbnb and they claimed that the cancellation was false and the request is still valid on their end. The host didn't have any reviews s I had nothing to fall back on. I wanted to speak to an Airbnb representative but its almost impossible to find a number to contact them. The site needs to make it easier to reach help instead of going through all these obstacles. We'll see how it goes when the day comes to check in. All this seems so sketchy for me since its my first time.",2,“Not a great start”

Luckily i book one month in advance and was able to dispute it with Airbnb/PayPal who I use to pay for this booking.

809,"I have been a host on Airbnb for approx. a year and for the most part haven't had to many issues with the company.   Recently,  I had someone who reserved 2 days on my calendar even though he has not passed Airbnb's screening process yet.  Airbnb allowed him to book anyway and they held up these 2 days all the way up till the evening of the first day of his reservation.  These 2 days was the busiest days of the month if not one of the busiest all year in my city due to a big event that happens once a year here.  All of the hotels downtown was booked and the nearby hotels was almost booked. There was no way that I could open these days on my calendar because Airbnb blocked them.  After many phone calls and emails to Airbnb, and when they realized that the person who wanted the 2 days wasn't going to send in his information, they finally agreed to unblock the 2 days on my calendar,  but they didn't do so until 4.30 pm in the afternoon on the same day that it was open. That being said,  those certain 2 days was never booked simply because they had it blocked for someone that was never screened through their company.  I explained to Airbnb that because they blocked those 2 days and didn't open them back up till the day of and day after,  I lost money.  The response I got was ""Well you never know,  someone may book them.""   I also explained that I think it's just terrible that they will allow anyone to book even though they have not gone through the screening process.  The response I got is ""This is what could happen since you have it on instant booking.""  Nowhere on this site does it explain that this could happen if a person is not thoroughly verified beforehand.  Obviously the person who blocked my days did not have adequate qualifications to book yet Airbnb still blocked the 2 days anyhow instead of checking him out beforehand.  Needless to say,  I no longer allow instant booking.",2,“Do not allow Instant booking” 
810,"airbnb stands the old gold standard for business, ""The customer is always right,"" on its head, as no matter how dysfunctional its user-unfriendly host site, it's the HOST who is either ""using the *wrong* browser (*right* browser, per airbnb, is Google Chrome) or having ""a PC issue."" I've repeatedly run into the problem that my calendar listing of ""unavailable"" changes to ""available"" unexpectedly, through no action of my own. I find this out only when I receive a prospective guest's request for renting the room. I then have the awkward task of declining the request, explaining to the guest that airbnb mistakenly displayed my space as available when it wasn't. When this happened yet again a few weeks ago, I called airbnb (you will not find a single phone number for the company on its website, though it inexplicably proclaims that it can be reached by phone; you will have to Google ""speak to a human"" to come up with the number). The customer ""service"" rep wanted to impress on me that the problem was obviously at MY end -- either due to some PC problem that I must be having or, more likely, to my personal preference not to use Google Chrome. (Perhaps airbnb gets a kickback from GC for each caller whom it browbeats into switching?) ""Service"" rep advised that I ""can call tech support"" whenever I want to change the room's availability status. (Convenient, right?) Subsequently I found other airbnb users, on reddit.com, who were experiencing the same calendar dysfunctionality as I was. I e-mailed the ""service"" rep to tell him this, only to receive a boilerplate response that there ""must be an issue"" at MY end. There are two good things about airbnb: (1) it performs a useful service for both hosts and guests and (2) it pays hosts very promptly. However, the customer service is virtually nonexistent, and what it does provide is permeated with an arrogant, not-OUR-problem attitude. To describe its customer service as abysmal would be massively overpraising it.",2,"“""The customer is always wrong""” "
811,"My recent use of airbnb for a hotel stay turned into such a disappointment that I will never use the service again and would not recommend it to others.  First of all, know that the map locations of many of the host sites are entirely wrong.  In fact, for my Bangkok search, I found virtually all of the locations to be significantly wrong, making a hotel location preference difficult and unreliable.  Second, know that certain hosts are listing the same hotel/apartment building as multiple sites in different areas.  This is deceptive, if not fraud, in my view, and airbnb does not seem to check such things.  Third, many of the hosts misrepresent their properties, including descriptions of their walking distances to popular features that clearly contradicts measurements on any google map.  Fourth, airbnb's cancellation policy is far too stringent for any long term reservation.  For example, my 3 week reservation for a Bangkok studio costing $40 a night ended up costing me $185 when I checked out the next day and cancelled the ""flexible"" policy reservation.  I was charged $80 for 2 nights, $90 for the non-refundable adm fee, and $15 for cleaning.  Airbnb's moderate and stringent cancellation policies are even worse.  And finally, airbnb does not allow reviews on any reservation stay that is cut short.  This virtually guarantees bad properties not being called out - which helps airbnb's booking fees of course.  For example, I booked a 3 week reservation for a 32nd floor view studio in Bangkok's Sukhumvit Suites, located on Soi 13.  Through prior emails, the owner assured me of its location and access details, its cleanliness, and its definate lack of bugs.  He lied on all accounts.  The place was plagued with multiple problems, but my finding and killing 11 cockroaches the first night is what prompted me most to move out the next day.  Now, it's bad enough that airbnb screwed me out of $185 for a ($40) cruddy place that was misprepresented.  But, I cannot do a review on the property - because, as per their policy, any reservation cancelled negates the option for a review.  How convenient for them.  Travelers, realize that airbnb's bad lodging reviews are being suppressed by this policy.  In summary, their business concept may be excellent, but their unacceptable management policies make it unsuitable for the knowing traveler. You may find a good deal on airbnb, but its not a business source to be trusted - in lodging information or booking policies.",2,“Good Business Idea With Hidden Problems & Unacceptable Policies” 
812,"I agree with others here - some apartments are listed truthfully and others are a flipping nightmare! I booked 4 AirBnB's during our month trip across Europe. The most inconvenient part of the process is meeting the host and getting the keys! It was frustrating - received numerous texts of when the host would meet us (I failed to consider the costs of international data plan), and still we waited. It's easier to book a hotel, especially when you consider arriving at an apartment that isn't fit to stay in AND a piddly refund of $24 for a $350 booking when you have to cancel (because the apartment stinks like sewage!)

When I complained the owner offered 10% back if I left immediately. When I refused he called the police. AIRBNB cancelled it so I could not review it. Another place in Paris was even worse but I couldn't find anywhere else so I stuck it out for a week. All the reviews were glowing for this place but my review never made it on the site. Very suspicious.",2,“Be Wary” 
814,"I think Airbnb can thank you medias which only talk about the glamorous part of Airbnb. In real life, there are issues related to the fact that hosts aren't professionals. Many people who use airbnb must be aware of that. Some hosts don't answer right away or don't answer at all. Some hosts want you to change your arrival date. Plus, there is the same issue as for shared accommodation when you decide to rent a room. There are so many things that can go wrong due to host culture, habits, disease... For instance, you may go to a house where hosts smoke or get up at 5am in the morning or listen to music late...etc..etc... None of that is considered by Airbnb. Airbnb makes you believe that the services of those amateur hosts is like hotels but that's not the case. 
Also, in many destinations, it is overpriced. For instance, in East Europe, many airbnb host offers are overpriced. They think that since customers are German, Austrian, French, British or American they can rise the prices. When one week rent in Slovenia is equal to twice the average local monthly income, you understand there is an issue somewhere.

This happens as they go off duty and hand  the case onto another case manager.

Me and my boyfriend recently booked an appartement through air bnb, traveled all the way to the destination, just to get a message from the host that she is very sorry but she can not let us in the appartement, the landlord had exchanged the locks on the door and she could not get in. Okay, not cool but can happen. So we called Air bnb, convinced that they would sort us out with something else. Nope! We spent over half (!) of our day on the phone with air bnb to sort out a place where we could sleep that night. After a lot of hesitation, she finally agreed to book us a hotel room but when she sent us the details, we realized it was 45 minutes out of the city where we were staying. Great! Anyway...no choice, we drove and stayed there for one night. The next day she had sorted us out another appartement, so we were happy and thought our holiday could finally begin. Nope! We got to the appartement and the host was there to give us the keys. She said she would leave in a few hours and we could have the flat from 3 PM onwards, she would take all her belongings with her. Sounded good and when we came back at 4 PM to ""move"" in she was gone. Unfortunately she did not clean up anything and the flat was quite dirty. Also she did not have a douvet and proper pillows, all in all it was very strange and not enjoyable at all. I understand that she was probably just trying to help out but air bnb you should do better. I was very disappointed by how the situation was handeld by air bnb and it made our holidays not really enjoyable and relaxing!

My first and only less-than-positive rental review was not published as the host did not review me in time. My most recent experience included an apartment which hadn't been cleaned prior to our arrival due to a cleaning service mix-up; the host didn't respond until the next day.

I had already booked another male guest who was emailing me with inappropriate requests and gave me the impression he thought this was a dating site. I cancelled five days before he arrived because of my previous bad experience. The guest phoned me begging to be allowed to stay with me. It was desperadoville.

I tried again and got a reply from someone called Lily who was very polite and continued to send me information from the site, but ignored my request for a refund.

827,"Airbnb has done a really slick PR campaign in the UK recently, making the concept of the ""sharing economy"" sound so great and noble. And to be fair I do know a couple of people who have made successful bookings with them. But from my own first experience I would only recommend using this site whilst exercising EXTREME CAUTION and a healthy dose of SCEPTICISM. Don't get swept up in the trendy PR message of  ""we're all one big, happy, caring-sharing family looking to break the monopoly of the evil hotel chains"". The company is currently valued at 10 billion dollars, it's a monster money-making machine in its own right and seems to have less integrity and accountability than many of the large hotel/letting giants.

I haven't actually made a booking with them yet (and probably never will) but my user experience on the site was pretty dire. We were looking for an apartment in Palma de Mallorca for a few days ... I hope this rather long review will give potential users an overview of why Airbnb may not be as good as it seems on paper.....

The very first property we considered clearly had incorrect information on the listing - ie, the title stated, and pictures showed, that it was a large 5 bed villa in what looked like an out-of-town location, BUT the 'blurb' underneath then went on to say that it was a small apartment with only 2 bedrooms and was in the centre of town. I clicked on the 'Contact host' button rather than the 'Request to book' button, since I wasn't requesting to book, I simply wanted to clarify the issue and give the host the benefit of the doubt that it was a one-off mistake. However, in my private Airbnb messages, I just got an automated reply saying Declined'. How can a booking be ""declined"" when it was never requested in the first place?? If they meant that my request for information was ""declined"" that's kinda even worse. It left a sour taste, ie, no personal response from the host explaining why their listing was wrong which it very, very clearly was

A second property we were interested in looked like a large villa in a beachside location . The response to the enquiry via the Airbnb message system requested us to contact the supposed host's ""wife"" via another email address (cunningly disguised to look like an offical Airbnb email)  this is a scam. DO NOT contact anyone from Airbnb if they suggest you communicate with them directly outside of the site. I got an automated email from Airbnb about 24 hrs later saying that they had detected a potential fraud and not to contact the host again. Which is good on the one hand that they spotted this (although I noticed 3 days later the fraudulent listing was STILL up on the site) but bad in that in only our second enquiry we had come up against a scam on their website, a property that clearly didn't exist for rent (Looking back, I think the scammers had just cut-and-pasted some photos from another website).

The one saving grace was an interaction with a host on our third enquiry who seemed genuine and was very polite and responsive and lovely. Thank you Richard of ""Huge Old Town Modernist Apartment"" listing, you were fabulous (and the only reason I've given 2 stars rather than 1 star overall).

However, the next couple of listings we looked at  showing on the Airbnb map as being separate properties, a mile apart, and listed at different prices - BOTH HAD EXACTLY THE SAME PICTURES!! I didn't bother contacting the hosts as I was fed up and disillusioned by this point.

The upshot of all this is that, honestly, you cannot completely trust the listings. 

And don't necessarily be lulled into a sense of security if the property you book has great reviews. I'm sure many, many reviews are genuine, but out of curiosity after our poor experience, I briefly trawled through 60 property listings in a search of ""Palma de Mallorca""  don't you think it's a little suspicious that I only found ONE review out of more than 130 individual user reviews for different properties that was less than 4.5 stars out of 5? Compare to TripAdvisor, which isn't perfect either, but at least they seem to actually allow people to post negative reviews and the customer can then take it all with a pinch of salt, read between the lines and get an overall balanced view. I cannot believe that all 60 of those Airbnb properties in Palma are SO marvellous that noone had posted a less-than-glowing review. Are they somehow blocking negative reviews from the site to make it look good? I would not be at all surprised.

Just take huge care when using Airbnb is all I'm saying, there are clearly lots of genuine hosts and happy customers, but the increasing popularity of the site has inevitably opened it up to large numbers of commercial agents looking to flog their inventory (rather than individual property owners trying to make a bit of extra cash from their beloved home, which is how Airbnb markets itself) as well as outright scammers and charlatans. Certainly the majority of listings we looked at in Palma were handled by agents, not owners, as evidenced by their multiple listings. Which makes it no different to booking with any other villa/property rental website.

It sounds like this company has become a willing victim of its own success  what started out as a great idea has been overtaken by financial greed and an inability to keep pace with the dramatic growth in terms of security and customer service. It sounds like it's become a numbers game for them  ""OK, so xx percent of our customers/hosts are really dissatisfied, but there's always a bunch of others to take their place, so we don't need to worry too much about keeping the complainers happy!""

Be aware that Airbnb does not vet the properties offered, or ask for any proof of ownership such as a utility bill or whatever, they take the host's descriptions/photos at face value. And pretty much anyone can register as a host, despite all the guff about verification' etc. Also be aware that your booking is not guaranteed  the host has the ability to cancel at very short notice, leaving you stranded. Plus if you have a problem, the small print on the Airbnb website (which I studied in detail) pretty much guarantees that you will have no comeback. Once you pay for your booking, they can effectively wash their hands of it and claim that it was up to you to check things out before you parted with your money. 

You may get lucky and have a lovely time with Airbnb, but PLEASE at least consider the potential pitfalls, of which there are many, and go into it with your eyes very wide open.",2,“Airbnb has done a really slick PR campaign in the UK...” 
828,"Beware of fees!!!  Booked three nights and had to change reservation.  Now, a $170 night reservation ($510)  has cost $120 in AirBNB fees.  Will never book through this agency again and will avoid hosts that utilize this service.",2,“Beware of fees!!!” 
829,"My husband and I are long-time Airbnb hosts and have had, with one exception, only positive experiences as hosts.  We've only been guests once, and that was somewhat negative.

I'd like to set the record straight regarding a number of complaints made by many on this review site.  And then I'll offer my own positive/negative thoughts about Airbnb.

First, as a host I have spent countless hours answering questions from potential guests who DO NOT read the listings.  If they'd only do that, they'd see that their questions are already answered.  Yet over and over I have to repeat what I've already written in clear, precise English, with correct grammar and spelling, and with bulleted lists of the amenities offered.

Second, before posting a listing, the host must choose their own cancellation policy, from a choice of three.  They range from a) allowing the guest to cancel at any time with a full refund (although I'm not certain if Airbnb charges some fee), to b) Moderate - the guest gets a refund if cancelled with five days of the arrival date, and finally c) Strict - there is no refund at all even if cancelled long before the date of arrival.  Airbnb does not set the cancellation policy; the host does, and it would behoove any guest to check a host's cancellation policy BEFORE making the reservation.  If you don't want to get stuck, don't reserve a place that has a strict cancellation policy.  You can even set this as one of your search parameters, and you won't be shown those listings.

Some of the reviewers here obviously didn't bother to read or understand the cancellation policy of the particular accommodation they booked, and then faulted Airbnb for not returning their money.  As I said, guests do not read the listings.  They should.

2) Other reviewers complained about Airbnb not keeping calendars up to date.  That is the full responsibility of the host.  When a guest looks at a calendar for a place they're interested in, it will say clearly when the calendar was last updated.  It is up to the guest to contact the host to determine if the required dates are available.  Some hosts never bother to update their calendars.  But that certainly isn't Airbnb's fault.

One reviewer urged guests to book a place that only has photographs done by official Airbnb photographers.  That can be very misleading.  I'm no photographer, but my unaltered photographs happened to come out great, so I did not use a photographer that Airbnb will supply free to hosts.  And I included some long shots that give an idea of the relative space.  However, our one rental experience DID use an Airbnb photographer.  When we got to the apartment, it looked exactly like the photos, except for one minor detail: the apartment was a dollhouse version of the photos.  The pro zoomed in on the sofa, then the kitchen, and finally the living room.  There was no way of us knowing that all three were contained in one tiny space smaller than our bedroom closet.  Nor did the photos, which showed a clean apartment, give us any hint of the grime imbedded on the windows and every surface that wasn't part of those photos!  There was no long shot in the bathroom we couldn't tell that it wasn't big enough to lay the bath mat down flat.  Claustrophobia was the name of that game.

After returning home, I wrote a balanced review of that place, with a few positive statements, but mostly negative.  It was not removed, nor was another completely negative review that was posted after we'd booked it.

But I am no apologist for Airbnb, even though as hosts, the company has been mostly very good for us.  Airbnb's non-existent customer service, lack of transparency, and inability to keep its website or app functional will be its undoing.  It is disgraceful to have to hold the phone for up to 45 minutes before speaking to an untrained and powerless C.S. rep who has no answers and doesn't have a clue how to deal with anything.  It is disgraceful that there is no way to escalate a question or problem to a supervisor, let alone anyone higher up the food chain.  It is disgraceful that one has to spend half an hour before finding an email address or a phone number to reach a company whose business model is an online business only.

Our one bad experience as hosts concerned a threesome of Asian exchange students on Christmas break from a university in the midwest.  I didn't realize that I could have set certain requirements for our guests in advance, because Airbnb didn't make this clear on their website until after we were in the throes of dealing with the problem.  The three guests, due to limited English, misunderstood our listing and thought they were renting an unoccupied house, rather than our guest rooms.  They expected us to hand over the keys and leave the house.  They had been planning to sneak in four more people, plus their two unhousebroken puppies, which I had told them in advance they couldn't bring.  We didn't learn this until the day after their arrival when, we found that the puppies had been left in their car overnight in the cold of winter.  Second, when we called Airbnb to report them (they did bring in a fourth person - not part of the original rental - because they obviously couldn't leave HER in the car overnight), we were told that someone had just left a negative review of them.  Seems they had come to us from another state (the first part of their midwinter party vacation), and totally trashed that house, leaving a trail of damage from the dogs and the seven people who were discovered occupying the place, which they had booked for three.  They were supposed to stay in our home for a week, but mercifully they left as soon as we confronted them about the dogs.  I guess they realized the jig was up and their plans had been thwarted.  But they did manage to cancel the rest of their reservation and get a partial refund, much to our dismay.  I added my own negative review to the previous host's, and they are both still there to this day, six months later.  But, and this is a big but, I implored Airbnb to boot the girl who was the account holder of record off the site.  These two negative reviews, and the damage they inflicted to the previous host, who lost a long-term rental from having to repair her house, should have been enough.  But she's still there, and still able to cause nightmares to any host not savvy enough to read her reviews.  This is a cautionary tale, and one of the many factors that I suspect will cause the downfall of Airbnb.  When a company does not value customer service and the customers it serves, but values money above all else, it is doomed.  Maybe later rather than sooner, but doomed nonetheless.

My sister and I used airbnb to rent (what appeared to be) a cute two bedroom, two bath place in the California wine country.  In addition to the daily charge, we paid a cleaning fee.  We arrived to a locked door, and no key where we were told it would be.  The house not only looked as though it had not recently been cleaned, it looked like it was never cleaned.  There was long expired milk in the fridge, filthy floors, broken fixtures, etc.  I could go on and on.  The place not only looked dirty, it smelled dirty.  We swept the floors, dusted, cleaned baseboards and kitchen cabinet doors and counter tops, and washed the sheets before we dared to sleep in them.  The interior looked nothing like the professionally taken photos in the listing.  The most baffling thing of all is all of the positive reviews for the property!

Last October, in London, the room I book had been given to another and I got something much less than I expected.  No apology from AIRBNB.

I recently booked an apartment in Copenhagen.  The host gave a non-peak rate, but AIRBNB tacked on a hidden fee to this rate.  When I asked about it, the reason, they said, is due to a currency conversion fee. The AIRBNB site posts US Dollars - and I paid in US Dollars. When I ask what the currency fee is about, nobody can explain - yet I still have to pay the fee.

There was even a picture of a flat screen tv in the ad for this apartment and the tv amenity had been checked off on the site.  The description of the apartment was generally misleading.I tried to sort it out with the host, but it wasn't working and I decided to cancel my reservation.  I raised a dispute with airbnb.  I've rented successfully on airbnb a bunch of times, have good reviews and enjoy the human element of it, But this one time I had a problem and actually needed help from Airbnb, they really seemed to side with the host from the beginning.  Before the dispute I was prepared to just pay for the nights I was there and really expected them to refund the entire balance, since the listing clearly violated the policies and standards they listed on their website.  But they said a cancellation fee of $50 a night would apply to every night I had booked, which I may get back if the host rebooks.  The host sent me a really rude email blaming me for treating him like a hotelier and saying I should have double checked if he had tveeeerrr yes.  Airbnb seemed to think this was reasonable.  
I really like the idea of what Airbnb is doing, but this experience gave me an uneasy feeling.  Their approach seemed more about a policy decision to keep hosts at all costs, even when they violate the Airbnb policy. THey kept the whole fee I had to pay based on a 28 day booking, even though I cancelled that booking and they will collect new fees during that period of time.",2,“My experience was similar to another recent review”

One place we stayed in was tiny and pretty old (it had cockroaches, the toilet gurgled every 20 minutes and sounded like it was going to explode!, the bathroom smelled of something unidentifiable but definitely gross, and the water heater was over the kitchen sink and leaked constantly into the sink.). But the pictures taken by airbnb photographers made it look like a large and new/clean place. The reviews were numerous and all positive (which makes me feel like airbnb deletes negative reviews because this place was definitely more than disappointing. And then when we went to our second airbnb place in another city (already booked, or else we would not have used them again), many of the same things happened (place much smaller than in pictures, not new or clean like in pictures, many issues like no curtain on window, smelled like mildew, tiny, many things didn't work in the apt.)

2011: AirBnB is great in theory - rent from or rent out your apartment to travelers who need a couple days to a couple weeks of housing in a city. The site also looks fantastic, especially as compared to Couchsurfing, which feels like a dirty forum. You find the place you want to book (making sure the host looks like s/he's not going to murder you, selecting the accommodations that are to your liking, etc.) and then you wait for the other person to respond to your request. Your credit card isn't charged until after the fact. 

However, what you end up getting is this - the people who are more likely to respond to you are charging up the wazoo for their place. One woman wanted $3400 for the month that I was looking to stay in NYC. Then there are specifications like you have to stay a month or you can't stay longer than 5 days, so it gets tedious dealing with their little conditions. The people that you are interested in won't respond to you at all. Terribly annoying.",2,"“Edited 12/31/14: Since my original post in 2011, I've...” "
839,"Airbnb is a great concept: people who have spare rooms in their apartments and houses (on a regular basis or when they're out of town) can rent that space to other people who are looking for a place to stay. This allows occupants to make some money and the people renting to save money or perhaps stay in a better location or room than what they might find at a hotel. 

That said, there are some issues. I'm sure problems will arise around safety, insurance, logistics, etc. My particular experience was that the web interface for renters is made to look a lot like a traditional hotel travel site. You input the dates, location, and other specifications of the accommodation you're seeking, you get back a list of options with prices, and you click ""book it"". Unfortunately the similarities between a typically hotel site and Airbnb end there. I tried to book four different apartments for a weekend in Boston, and none went through. I had to wait days for occupants to get back to me, and when they did all of them said either their place wasn't available or they decided not to rent it (although they were all very friendly). Net net, the site seems to have inaccurate information on availability and does not have proper incentives in place for occupants to adhere to their listed proposals. I would try Airbnb again, but only as a last resort, until they clean up their service.",2,“Airbnb is a great concept: people who have spare rooms...”

I have zero cancellation rate as a host; all my apartments are exactly as shown and cleaned by professional crew.

Recently, a guest attempted to hack (!!) the building router that produces wifi for the all other tenants by installing his personal password on it. We prevented it, sending a technician. The guest left a review saying ""apparently wifi was shared and others in the building didn't like it"". What kind of a person expects NON-SHARED wifi nowadays and, after not receiving it, writes a negative review??? Wifi by definition is a shared facility, even in Marriott or Hilton.

I don't know what hosts will soon remain on airbnb, but their reviews policy is clearly encouraging scams like that to put down good hosts.

878,"I really don't understand all the poor reviews for Airbnb here! I have used Airbnb around ten times over the past few years. I am currently staying in an Airbnb apartment in Buenos Aires, and a few weeks ago my partner and I were in a lovely Airbnb house in Brighton.

It's definitely worth taking your time choosing where to stay. I tend to avoid places that lool like a company renting out multiple properties. I also only go for places that have plenty of good reviews (for me, good reviews are as important as a good location, and defintely more important than great photos).

I much prefer the experience of staying in an Airbnb property compared with a hotel. You tend to get more space and more interesting experiences.

Having said all this, I have never had any problems with the hosts or properties I've stayed in, so I can't comment on how good Airbnb is at resolving difficulties.  Also I wish that Airbnb allowed you to sort the search results by price on their site.

879,"We stayed in Prague for 5 days, Lake Como for 3, Pistoia for 4 and Greve in Chianti for 4 with very good accommodations via AirBnb. The apartments were as described and the hosts met us every time. The communication with AirBnb and the hosts was excellent.

 Our last apartment in Rome didn't work out as well as the others. The host met us and was helpful but his toilet would not function properly. He fixed it once but the second time it stopped up and would not flush was too much for us and we left for a hotel. The host offered other accommodations but we were done.

My real disappointment is with AirBnb. They pestered us as soon as we left one city for reviews. We did them. It was easy to be positive. Their  tease is that we could read our hosts' review of us once we completed our reviews. We really had little concern for our hosts reviews of us but we did read them with no surprises. My wife and I are in our sixties so we are not much trouble. However the last review was half positive (our host did try and we liked the apartment next to the Vatican) but the plumbing failures were too much for us and a negative narrative in the review. AND it has not been published a week after I wrote it. The positive reviews that I wrote were published quickly.  I hesitated to write a negative review but i felt I owe more to my fellow travelers than to my host. I am disappointed in AirBnb for not publishing my review quickly!",4,“My AirBnb experiences were mostly good!” 
880,"Ive been renting out 1 room in my townhouse for nearly a year.  I think it helps that im home a lot so that keeps guests respecting my house.

I personally havent had any major issues with guests. Definitely some disrespect at times though.

Heres a list of the good and bad.. Judge for yourself.

Good..

You get extra money whilst still having many nights to yourself.  Im not getting as much as i would with a tenant though.

On your holidays you can keep the house to yourself 

You get to meet people from all walks of life.  You get to hear some very interesting tales.

Bad..

A serious lack of common sense in some guests. Things you think are obvious and a given, wont be understood at all by some guests. It will surprise you. An example, 1 woman left her electric blanket on every day and night of her stay.  Guests will leave lights on day and night whether theyre home or not.

As a single woman ive had an issue with a pushy aggressive male who stayed.

Guests may not be honest about what they damage but ive been pretty lucky.

At first they were terrible - customer service was nonexistent, hold times were forever and their agents were extremely unqualified and very rude!  However- they have improved over the last 12 months. We rent an apartment out to others and have easily rented it more than 50 times. Hold times can still be long however their agents are much more professional and even friendlier.  They still have a monotonous verification process and the main issue now is their systems must be awful-their website has always been awful and extremely difficult to navigate they have changed the looks of it many times but it has never been a good website and totally surprised -based in Northern California you would think this would be easily under control.  They never seem to have the notes from when we called in prior as to who is authorized on the account. We are constantly repeating ourselves to get this done. Whoever the CTO is must be replaced and this will be a premier site. In the 50 rentals  3-4 were an issue and needed their involvement all worked out in the long run.

895,"I just had my first bad experience when my host canceled a reservation I booked months ago for a place near the beach the week of 4th of July. Just be aware that when this happens to you, you only get the exact amount you paid back as a refund. They will give you a credit of 10% of what you paid toward another AirBnB location IF you can find another place on AirBnB, but maybe your experience would be like mine, where 2 weeks before the 4th of July, the only (one!) other place available in the area is 4x the price of what I rented. Even the hotel room I was able to find is more than 2x the price. 
It does not make a difference whether the cancellation policy is strict or flexible, that policy only applies to guests, not the host. They have assured me that the host did have some serious personal reason for having to take her place down, and it's not just because she wanted to stay in a great place on the beach that week. 
I'm not going to trash AirBnB because I've had a few successful stays with great hosts and places that turned out to be exactly what was described. Also, their customer service is good. When this type of thing happens, it's a bit lame that you can't talk to someone by phone, but the email back and forth has been prompt and informative, and they kindly gave me a coupon toward a future rental in the next year since the 10% credit policy wouldn't apply.",4,“Generally good but be aware the host can cancel”

 So far all my reviews have been published, but the last one in Fes ( Morocco) still has not come out. I still gave Airbn top credit as company, but I lowered to three points the Fes accommodation just in relation to amenities. This, due to the low standard of the cooking area and not caring for safety.  Otherwise I gave top credit as the apartment was a very well presented and arranged with gusto.

899,"I used Airbnb for my trip back in May and I stayed at over 5 listings across Europe, namely London, Paris, Nice (2 listing), and Amsterdam. Reading the reviews somehow made me feel wary although I had a wonderful time at all of these listings. It was understandable at some of the listings the internet are a bit off and a few dusty cupboard. But all in all it was not bad at all despite it being my first experience.

 I was declined for a lot of listings too and despite some of them personally replying me saying that the dates are not available which is nice but I would still get it too if they just decline because every query requires one to provide number of guests and date of check in and check out. Them sending us an automated declined would suggest that our dates/number of guests did not match their listing. 

As far as being first time users and not being reviewed thus the rejection, I feel that it is important that you create your profile with complete profile of yourself such as your intended trip purposes and a photo. (as much as we are afraid to trust the other person they are also afraid and have to thread very carefully even more so as they are allowing us into their homes) 

I was never a host but at all the 5 listings I took time to ask the hosts their experience as hosts and they positively described their experience as host and 1 of the host was even a Super Host on Airbnb. 

As I am sure with all other Bnb's or accommodation everyone is worried they might be scammed and we are clueless to know whether or not a particular contact could be a scam thus I suggest taking extra precautions for all payment transactions and personal infos released. Airbnb is definitely and interesting concept to me as they allow me personal contact with locals and give me better insights to their own city.

Alternatively, you can rent a completely self contained space, too, and have all the comforts of home for less than a hotel.

Whenever I have had a question or require additional information, Airbnb representatives return my call or answer my emails in a timely fashion. My deposits have always been returned and, twice, I received $25 bonuses. Not a single host has complained about dishonest or disagreeable guests. In fact, several of the hosts have become friends. One make-up artist wouldn't let me leave the flat without doing my make-up. One host sent me to Wales, to stay in his flat without charge, and another took me to Italy, to stay with his mother in her villa. I'm 65 years old and don't enjoy the isolation of a hotel.

903,"I've been a host now for about 9 months. We have had almost all positive experiences (except for the one lady who begged to bring her ""well behaved"" dogs... but I digress).  I am fine with the way the reviews are set up, I think it keeps people honest. A couple of suggestions for folks using Airbnb: (1) don't wait until the night before your visit to try to book a room. Even a usually conscientious host can forget to check their email. (2) ask questions before you book. (3) book a place where the pics were taken BY Airbnb, that helps reduce the chance of scamming (and if you're a host, at least last year it was free). 

My only real complaint is their claim that they ""can't"" transfer the money to you over the weekend; so if you have someone at your place Friday - Monday, you probably won't see the $ in your acct until Tuesday. We are in a 24-7 financial market, I'm sure they could fix that if they wanted to. 

I for one hope that (a) the # of negatives reflects the fact that people are more likely to share those than take the time to share positives; and (b) airbnb does address what seem to be some fixable situations so that I as a host can continue to meet and host folks from all around the world.",4,“I've been a host now for about 9 months” 
904,"I Hv made a last min booking w host Willy Li (mother Kitty Liu) in Hong Kong at airbnb Thru Airbnb in end of november 2013. Before booking, i saw some bad comments on Airbnb thru other webpage. However , I  still proceed to book w one of the host , Willy Li n mother Kitty Liu. Kitty Liu entice me with discount if i book last min w them. after a few qns n exchanges of emails abt our requirement, i presume everything in order, i proceed to book w 'Wil' = Willy Li ( rabbit biting red carrot)
After reaching Hong Kong we (3 adult 3 children) were place in an apt - 2 bedrooms, 1 hall, 1 kitchen , I toilet at ladies mkt (as per my request) but very old bldg. Willy Li met one resident n was scolded for renting illegally again. Later he told us we Hv to shift out 2 days later cos this is not the units for us, ( he had many such units) but wanted to gv us 2 seperated tiny units run down n stuffy rooms at prince edward rd ( an apt partition into 5 units w toilet- but he call it studio apt- my god, so misleading) . We do not agree to it after viewing. immediately on the  first night, I wrote to airbnb to complain our situation n the  next day, the host came to talk to us again saying airbnb told them to settle our issue. They are confusing us w many reasons. Willy Li n Kitty Liu told us no need to tell Airbnb as they won't help us n difficult to get refund fm Airbnb etc n try to act kind to us but end up we pay them additional HKD750, as we do not want to be bothered w accomo ( also very blur n confuse ) .The mother Kitty Liu is adamant that we Hv to move out on 4thday ( actual book 5days) to the tiny rooms, despite we Hv paid them additional HKD 750 to stay for 3 nights (2nd day to 4thday) which they claim we are compensating to the guest who book the units we are staying ( my husband is sick, we are tired, confuse n con by them) . Also we are there to travel w kids, we temporary agree to their suggestion n paid. It is stressful for the past 4 days. We taught our kids to learn fm dis experience. Made them involved n help to look for accomo online( difficult as most hotel fully book or either too small units or far away) .

Willy mother , Kitty Liu is experience n tough woman, despite on 4th day we appeal to her to extend 5thday n ask for alternate accomo cos my husband is sick, she after collected the money, changed face n said we can book hotel if dont like the tiny units,  So is Willy Li, he became heartless n unkind.
At 4am of 5th day, I found one big ,spacious ,cosy , clean n nice condo like unit, my children loves it, n we pay very high rental ( also book thru airbnb) . we are happy n worth paying it and Had a good sleep n rest in dat apt. I later found out Willy Li Hv 10 units in hand, n 1 unit available on the 5th day but refuse to offer us (advertised in  travelmob.com - his ad he put name as  Wil w a rabbit n carrot pic at Airbnb webpage)
After we return home, 2 days later after a good rest, I wrote to Airbnb to complain our experience n ask for refund, but Airbnb offer to refund the HKD750 which we pay the host additional in cash at Hong Kong. Anyway, i gladly accept it n thank them for their help n did not argue further. We are happy at least we got back some money as Airbnb is able to help get some refund fm host n offer a USD100 discount for our next booking. the greedy hosts Willy n Kitty Liu did not got his bite, so they must be very angry n hopping up n down. Ha ha, to us if money can buy his pride, why not? Willy Li claim to be a  Curtin U graduate, shame on him, mummy's boy, n for having low self esteem. We pity Willy n Kitty for hving no standard in life. 
In fact, after we return, we saw another review on his page that Willy n Kitty also try to cheat another guest Lim but the guest did not gv in. 
Wonder why they must resort to such tatics n make themselves popular w bad names. They Hv so many units, earlier preview were good but misled us. If can made so much fm rental, why still want to cheat n be greedy? To Wil n Kitty Liu,   Money is not everything. Like the guest Lim said to Wil n Kitty Liu:  wat comes around goes around. 
To those who want to book online, ask many questions ( even silly qns) to test the hosts patience, if they sound rude, don book, n click the unit's picture u want to book ( anyway dis may not be true, as Wil sound ok when I email him) overall, Luck also plays a part , (as the 2nd unit, the host delay replying to my qns, ( but she is nice after meeting her) but I am desperate to get out of the situation, I proceed to book, u got to be prepared to lose out money n Hv guts to do so) I suppose.",4,“I Hv made a last min booking w host Willy Li (mother...”

927,"How many times can you afford spending 2-3 hundred dollars a night when you go on a vacation? That 2-3 Hundred dollars a night can be used for entertainment purposes, which helps the city businesses. Let me explain more. My wife & I now can afford to take vacations. If it wasn't for Airbnb. We would not have the money for a plane ticket to go anywhere. We would not have money to go out during the vacation to the local restaurants, or concerts or clubs, or shop at the mall because all our savings would be going towards the Hotel fees. So before we learned about airbnb, we decided not to take any more vacations. It's a waste of money and we did not have any fun. Now that we use airbnb, we take vacations so we can visit the world. We go out during our vacations and have fun. Spend money for good food, shop at the malls and just enjoy having a great time with the money we saved. Not only Airbnb has helped us take vacations. We are also host, which airbnb helps us to pay our bills each month. Living off two jobs that don't pay that much is really hard in a economy where the city charges so much on taxes. Who can afford to live these days? Who can afford to buy homes or a new car these days? Who can afford it? Now we are hosting, we can afford our home. We can pay our bills. We can live in a better life style without worrying if our bills will be paid next month. Thank you Airbnb for making our lives better. Thank you airbnb for making the city and the citizens lives better. Thank you airbnb for showing us that you do care. Thank you airbnb for allowing a better way to live. I am a proud host and traveler who says join Airbnb, you gotta love it & you will love it.",5,"“Airbnb, You gotta love it.” "
928,"I don't really understand all of the bad reviews. First Airbnb tells you of any cancellation policies so it is clear going in if you have to cancel you may not get a full refund depending on the policy. I have used it once to stay at a great place in Cabareta, Dominican Republic at a place called Casa Luna. The hosts went above and beyond in being great host family to my bf and me. We had a great time and would never have met them if we hadn't used the service. I would recommend using this site and I will use it again.",5,“Had a great experience” 
929,"Airbnb is like no other. They did do hotels, what Uber did for the taxi business. They protect both the renter and owner - most sites favor one over the other. Not these guys.

941,"I had a terrible interaction with an extremely greedy property manager using airbnb to get occasional guests but mostly long term tenants. They refused to waive the almost $200 cancellation fee when I tried to cancel my two day stay, more than 3 weeks ahead of time, due to jury duty. Messages deteriorated into threats and name calling.And I repeatedly told them to stop messaging me. 
I canceled despite the fee and filed a resolution request. The next day Darren at airbnb told me he read the messages and wanted to hear what happened. He listened intently, and then told me he was so sorry that this had happened.He explained how Airbnb appreciated kind vibrant people like me and my family. He said people like the host I dealt with were the exception and that he'd handle them. He added that Airbnb valued us as guests and hosts. He also refunded me for the entire stay and offered a $100 voucher for my next trip. 
After the very kind and comforting conversation, I received a personal sincere email just as nice.

Yes, in order to use AirBnB you do have to send them a photo of your ID, verify your email address and phone number, etc. But this is just due diligence on their part, to ensure a minimum level of safety for their hosts and their guests, and I would not use their service without these basic precautions.

Perhaps most of the AirBnB reviews here are negative because most people don't bother to seek out a reviewing site unless they have had a bad experience.",5,“Nothing but Good Experiences with AirBnB” 
943,"Update: Just stayed at another awesome five star AirBnB. This stay was a week in the Netherlands. Amazing hosts, gorgeous big light airy loft with a kitchenette, dining space, balcony with cafe table, and a view from heaven! $90 a night. These were gold metal, top rated hosts, and they totally deserved their rating. I repeat: look for the raves reviews and ONLY book those hosts. ONLY
I spent two wonderful five day stays in Europe using AirBnB. Perfect places, awesome landlords, great experiences! After reading all these negative Nancy reviews I just had to put in my two cents worth here. 
Simply put, this is all on you renters. You have the INTERNET. Awesome tool this thing. Use it and do your research.  When you find a listing that interests you, for cripes sake read ALL the reviews. Judiciously. Bad reviews? Don't book. No reviews? Don't book! Google map the place. You can look at the street view and area. Safe? Dicey? Easy access to where you want to be? Consider those pictures on the web site. Gorgeous view? Old building? No lift?. Ok, you are looking at a 5 floor walk up with luggage. Know that. Does everyone rave about the landlord being helpful and available? Good sign. All five stars? Good sign. I've had nothing but wonderful experiences with AirBnB, but it isn't idiot proof, and of course nothing is perfect. Use your head and it can open the doors to some amazing adventures. I LOVED my experience, and my hosts. They all had numerous five star reviews. I gave them two more!",5,"“Wonderful site, just use your smarts...” "

946,"We have been hosts with Airbnb for more than 2.5 years.  We rely on guests' ""verifications"" by more than just a phone number ( 1 verification) because we live here and don't want to find ourselves greeting more guests than we agreed to host, or people intending to engage in criminal conduct from the guest room of our home.  And we submitted to the, ""whole boat"" of verification so our guests know they haven't reserved space in the Bates Motel where mummified mom will be in the basement.  We didn't have to take a video of ourselves, but the questions were pretty intrusive and they were obviously being validated while we were answering them.  
         Our reviews are consistently good because we only rent our guest house or our guest rooms with freshly cleaned bed linens and towels, vacuumed carpeting and fully equipped kitchens and bathrooms with clean plumbing fixtures.  Again, we live here.  So we're not attractive to people whose hunger for privacy is for doing things they're ashamed of or fearful of being arrested for.
          I agree that Airbnb seems to be trying to replace formerly one-to-one phone calls to customer support with FAQs and emails ( the endless effort to increase profits, evidently).  It's also clear that 'hackers' have tried ( and maybe succeeded ) to invade the email communications between hosts and prospective renters.  A couple of times there have been really odd inquiries from travelers requiring inappropriate lodgings ( an inconveniently long drive from the locale of their planned activity ) or asking coyly if we're ""really secluded"" ( or asking to negotiate lower rent - although our rates are much lower than all the local hotels and licensed, commercial bed and breakfasts.)  Or asking about availability for a long period of time in which they don't state their planned travel time.  (query would this be somebody looking to book our space and rent it to 3rd parties at higher prices?) So, we ""deny"" those requests, we don't make a reservation and then cancel it when somebody more attractive wants those dates.  The former is prudent, the latter is greedy.
      All that information demanded by Airbnb from hosts about their accommodations and neighborhood and rates needs to be read.  People used to choosing which ""they-all-look-alike"" motels don't want to really compare what's on offer - just the prices.
       It's so hard for some people to grasp the major differences between dealing with individual homeowners and booking a bargain-priced ""special"" room rate at one of the big chain hotels that look like they're always clean, because the in-house cleaners are expert at making it look like the fixtures have been cleaned and the bed linens have been changed whether or not that's actually true.
        I'd like it if Airbnb would create another category for the ""multi-unit""  property managers in the bigger municipalities.  If people are having bad experiences with them I prefer that their dubious business practices through Airbnb not be the reason that the Airbnb guests we want to accommodate are not being discouraged.  The rest of us scrub our sinks and bathtubs and launder the sheets and expect to be treated respectfully by travelers as we strive to accommodate them.
        I'm annoyed by the young couple who reserve one of our two guest rooms, ""text message"" that they can't check in before the performance they have tickets for and will not arrive until after 11:00 p.m., and then texts at 11:30p.m. that ""something has come up"" and they'll not arrive after all but will return to their big city home that night.  Wait for it . . . then they want a refund because they cancelled long after the announced deadline to cancel.  
         That's one reason hotels cost so much more.  They have to refund the last minute cancellation.  Airbnb rates are lower because, in part, last minute cancellations don't get refunded.
         We love Airbnb, but I hope they improve ""support"" access and response, and read these complaints to mean that verification procedures need simplified and improved ""how-to"" helps.
          And in this marketplace, there is no perfect option: certainly not HomeAway and subsidiaries. 
          In almost five years, the Home Away group has raised their prices to homeowners and pressured us forcefully to give them access to the money collected to hold reservations and to our banking information.  They ""punish"" owners for holding on to the process of making reservations and holding advance payments and security deposits rather than giving that whole financial aspect to Home Away.  And this year they're charging a percentage of the rents to renting travelers.
          So, our experience as hosts has been, we're fair and square with our guests and with Airbnb and we've been fortunate to have no problems with Airbnb guests.  And very few problems with guests from word-of-mouth referral or the VRBO/HomeAway group.",5,“It works like it says it does for us for over two years” 
947,"We recently rented a room in the in the SOMA neighborhood of San Francisco, and were excited about the ""Spacious bedroom w private bath"".  Unfortunately, when we arrived the situation was not as advertised.

The kitchen was an untidy mess, with fast food containers and dishes laying about.  We ended up leaving instead of cooking the planned meal.

The bed had clearly been slept in, there was no top sheet, and when we turned the bottom sheet inside out discovered that the bed had blood stains.  Needless to say, gross!  The bed was also rock hard.

The floor, windowsill and desk were all dust-covered and strewn about with items.  There were no towels in the bathroom.  The room mate's SO provided a couple of threadbare towels.

We contacted the host, who was not present at the time, and essentially received a ""this is not a hotel, it's how I live, so deal with it"".

We then reached out to Airbnb, were assigned a case manager (Tiago), and after providing documenting pictures then were granted a refund of the base price of the rental.  We've stayed with Airbnb hosts myriad times and this was our first negative experience.  Airbnb smoothly turned things around for us.  They also reached out to the host for a discussion regarding rental standards and communication.

954,"Hi

I'm an Airbnb host, and came across this site looking for a solution to a minor technical glitch with my listing. I simply don't understand the reviews i found on here at all... when you book somewhere through airbnb you are booking with a host, not to stay with the actual company itself. I take immense pride in providing a clean, high standard room-in-someone's-house accommodation and go well out of my way to be really helpful to guests... mine arrived late tonight, i made them supper - i don't see anyone writing a good experience on this site, but i sure as anything know alot of people get good experiences using the airbnb service - it's a service, they don't own the accommodations, like the reviews on this site seem to imply. Sure, tonight's guests said their last experience was not a friendly one, but i generally don't hear any bad stories, only good, and plenty of them. Basically it's like a homestay, so why are people comparing it to hotels? Read descriptions, and ask about locations because obviously airbnb aren't going to allow you to see a precise location of a property - you might turn up unannounced pretending you have a reservation.. and burgle the place or squat in it. In short, I love airbnb, and will continue to travel the world by having the world come stay with me rather me go anywhere.

P.S. since reading the other reviews on here, i notice an awful of people claiming to have been scammed... and grumbling about airbnb not sorting it out for them, all these people appear to have not actually booked through airbnb but willingly circumvented the actual airbnb booking process and tried to book direct with a host... and then complain that they are just referred to airbnb's t&cs. Surely if you want the support and backup of Airbnb you must realise you need to book through them, not circumvent them... i'm amazed people would actually think they would still be protected when they complete their booking outside of the company. Airbnb is about connecting with hosts who have a unique place to offer, not some cheap long term rent that you book outside the company, and logically, finding these unique places to stay, is through the company and yes they take a commission and you get a service, and security to a point in return. Of course, the 99.9999% of excellent experiences aren't reported here, they just left a good review on airbnb's actual website and got on with planning their next trip, or some other positive aspect of their life.",5,"“A fantastic experience, unavailable any other way!” "

Having backpacked before, I was used to this in hot climates, so a couple in the bathroom wasn't an issue. 2 days after our arrival, there were many in the bath and under the bed, so we told the host. She was amazing and offered a full refund. I didn't even have to contact Airbnb as they had been informed and sent the refund straight to us, not only that, but as we had to move into a hotel for the remaining 3 nights (which was considerably more expensive), Airbnb offered to pay the difference and were very good in answering our questions via email whilst we were travelling.

At the end of the day we really appreciated coming home and jumping into the big beautiful swimming pool.  But what I really liked about staying at Carols was how close I was to nature - with the house sitting at the top of a ridge we were able to observe a variety of wildlife, that sometimes I felt like I was sitting in a tree house.

I would like to reply to this thread. It was issue with specific person dealing with my case at that time. My issue was resolved by another manager assigned to my case, who dealt with it very diligently and helped me through resolving all issues. He reassured my trust back in AirBnB. Thank you very much

ISSUE Before: 

I booked an apartment in London and found various issues with cleaning. So i decided to call AirBnB and give them feedback and ask for suggestions, this is how they handled my situation : 

1) I was told at the starting of the call that cooker is being used by me as she can see in pictures that it is hot - She wasnt even looking at right pictures. She was looking at ""Siemens touch stove"" rather than cooker - which she didnt want to agree to me and was telling me that if its not clean then its because i have used it. Then without listening, she said lets move to next point.

2) Mentioning for more ""general amenities"" for 10 days is not to be called as an issue - on which i explained that i have clearly mentioned that in my original email -""Doesnt really matter but SERIOUSLY?""

3) She said she can get the cleaner and that's all she can help with.

4) I asked if she is ok with my family staying in apartment where flush doesn't work for next 10 days- This didnt sound an real issue to her. I would like to know ANY person who would have paid 1700 for 10 days and you let people aged 60 live in apartment where flush doest work for more than 24 hours, to answer how good they feel about this?! - But as per tone of agent at AirBnB this wasnt something to be concerned about. - At the end of that ""argument"" - she mentioned she will let host look into it.

5) She kept mentioning, i cant get refund and stuff. To which i replied i dint ask for refund at first place when i called first time about issues to AirBnB. I was told if issues that i mentioned are there, that means i am not happy and i should look for another apartment in same range and can get refund. - So, i clarified that i was told by AirBnB and it wasn't me asking for refund.

6) On point of kitchen shelve being broken, i was told, this doesnt seem to be an issue - I WOULD like to let you know, my family is stayin in that apartment that i booked through AirBnB for 10 days, i dont think i would like them to stay in apartment that has broken shelves where glasses can be crushed because of upper shelve falling off because off no hook.

I tried explaining agent at AirBnB that what she is in video is after i have put a hook in the hole to let shelve take support of hook myself, otherwise when my parents opened the cupboard, it was diagonally aligned on glass cups - but again, she was reluctant to accept that this is even an issue.

--- In my defense - 
a. if I would have been paying small amount, i will expect these things but not when i am paying way more. I COULD have easily booked AMAZING HOTEL rather than booking apartment through AirBnB and would have costed me less. 

b. I would consider this also as a fact that i have seen this on first day and shelves are in this shape, i dont want to wait until something falls apart and injure my parents.

7) On point of utensils not being clean and stained - after resending pictures of what i was talking about ( Point number 1 mentioned) - I was told, well, base of utensil is clean but may be not top part so its ok. not a big deal. I would like AirBnB agents to be more careful and sensitive to what they are saying and talking to customers. Agent basically asked me to go ahead and cooked in half dirty stained utensil because according to her its fine. Seriously?

Overall, i am very unahppy with booking, host and top of it, AIRBnB. I have been staying in apartments my friends book through AirBnB from last 1.5 years, across the world. After this experience, this is last time i have booked through AirBnB and wont book through AirBnB again.",5,“Horrendous on call experience - EDITED : [After my stay finished] -> From 1 star to 5 star”

968,"I had a 2 months reservation for Romania, the host seemed friendly and understanding, and everything was going great and shiny. Just until the moment I had to cancel my trip, because just 1 week before the flight my passport got stolen. 

To be honest, when I filed for refund and applied for extenuating circumstances, I didn't expect much. Just ""hey, it can't do any harm, right?"" attitude. 

You can imagine my surprise, when one of the support team guys contacted me and went through length to get all the details of the situation and give me the best deal possible!

As a result, I had a partial refund AND a voucher for the next trip. But, most importantly, Taylor was incredibly HUMAN in understanding the situation and her actual support. 

You could feel that you are not talking to some automated response human machine on the other side of the globe. That's what was really precious. 

Thank you, guys, I will definitely travel with you again!",5,“The best company support I've ever had!” 
969,"I have read positive and negative comments on this site. All I can tell you is that airbnb is for the person who would like to save money and experience something other than a hotel and it also is good for the person renting who has the extra space and can earn some income. It may not perfect, as hotels/motels are not either. But if you are adventurous and want a place for less than you would usually pay for a hotel/motel, then Airbnb is for you. Do Not expect the Ritz Carlton if you are paying a minimal rate. This company is an A  in my book.",5,“I think this is a great site” 
970,Airbnb gives you a unique experience to travel around theb globe for cheap getting a great feel for each city you stay in by staying in a very different atmosphere than a hotel. I give it 5 stars!,5,“Airbnb is a must if you are a traveler”

972,"Relatively easy to use and navigate. Not perfect but I gave it 5 stars because I found it by chance looking for a discount lodging site. Within an hour, I was able to get a bid on a place to stay that was 1/2 the price of a local motel 6 and looked twice as nice.  Since then, I've used it 4 times, all with positive experiences even when I had to cancel. Highly recommended so long as you choose the right location & communicate with landlord in advance. Will definitely use again if on tight budget or looking for a personal touch like a B & B without need for a breakfast.",5,“Relatively easy to use and navigate” 
973,"Airbnb is a wonderful company with great ideas. However, sometimes people can become frustrated especially when dealing with people across various time zones. Travel is a messy business. That being said, most of the problems come from the hosts, and not Airbnb itself. For example, my first experience with the company involved my host canceling just days before my arrival, based on the status on my age (Airbnb standards state you have to be 18+, however she wanted 21+)... Obviously I was frustrated. She had my money and wouldn't let me stay in her home. Airbnb quickly cleared the air, refunded me my money, and gave me 20% off plus an additional $100 for reparations and funds for my next booking. Often times its easy to blame the whole, when really it is simply the disorganization and miscommunication between host and guest. I encourage everyone to use Airbnb and support locals!

974,"I just love this site. I travel now almost exclusively with Airbnb since I rather stay in apartments than in hotels. I also have my own apartment spare room in Airbnb. However this is not for people looking for the safety of a hotel. Using this site, you are going to people's houses. You need to check first your host to see that he/she is reliable and then book. The same applies to hosts. Take a look at the reviews of a person before accepting them to your house. It's common sense. Only negative is their high cost. They charge 15% on top of each reservation for their service. It could be 10%.",5,“I just love this site”

Host had a serious problem with their place, we moved out, host was being unreasonable on our request for a refund, but within a few hours of calling airbnb and providing photo proof of the problem, a full refund was issued.  I couldn't be happier with airbnb's customer service (and especially the efforts of Holly at customer service, Patsy at Airbnb trip experience, and whoever else was on the team that handled my case).  I've dealt with hotels, airlines, all sorts of institutions where problems sometimes arise, and I've never before seen such a fast and fair resolution.",5,“Customer service as a guest was great”

We could walk or use public transportation along with our rental car.  It was everything and more, especially paying attention to every detail.  I would recommend anyone to stay at this location.  Superb.  Thanks you Patrick Porter.  Sincerely,  Brian, Jeff, Wayne, and Gary",5,“Our host Patrick was delightful” 
979,"I have been hosting now for about 9 months on airbnb with nothing but positive experiences; I have so far received just under $20,000 in income from a single apartment on airbnb alone. Some of the complaints here are fickle and/or knee jerk reactions to experiences that airbnb.com may not have been able to control. The verification system is actually quite reassuring, and it is up to the host/guest to make a judgment on a case-by-case basis. We have accepted some guests with no verifications whatsoever and we have still had no bad experiences or instances of fraud. There will always be fraudsters, especially on the internet, it is up to you to be vigilant in any of your interactions and transactions when doing business with anyone. There is a reason why airbnb urges you not to communicate outside of the website, and it is not just so they can secure their commission - it is for security. If someone asks to communicate outside the site I immediately flag them. I also read a review about receiving funds on weekends... if you have paypal you will receive the money about 24hours after check-in; if you are set up to receive your payments via bank account, then this is dependent on your bank being open on weekends, again something out of airbnb's control. Again, I have been nothing but pleased with this listing service... it's definitely the best I've encountered on the internet. HouseTrip also seems like a nice site, but it's not bringing in any $$ for us yet.

UPDATE (Year 3 - October): $80k earnings on year 2, $100k and counting on year 3. More than 90% of bookings made on airbnb. I have had no major problems. One guest damaged something by accident and agreed to pay damages from the deposit. Don't know what I'd do without this service, and I'm still confused by the overwhelmingly negative reviews on this site. I recently used the website to stay at an apartment for the first time as well, and I was very happy with our host and the quality of her accommodations. She could have dusted more, but I also understand that I was staying in someone's apartment and not at a hotel. The price could also not be beat for staying in downtown Chicago.",5,“I have been hosting now for about 9 months on airbnb...”

I have used airbnb.com successfully more than once, and each time I've met friendly hosts who understand how to help their clients.

I think if you want to have a bit more privacy and more accommodations than AirBnB is the way to go. 

For the host, it is an incentive because you get a small compensation from having people in your home; using your water, gas, power & sewage. Utilities add up!
