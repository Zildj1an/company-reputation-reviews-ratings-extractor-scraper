My credit card company did what the refused to do. Bottom line. Don't let these companies take advantage. They try to robo charge your credit card after they get your credit card info and provide little to no help after the robo charge when you try to dispute it or cancel whatever the charge was for. Always report it to your credit card company as a fraudulent charge",1,freelancer.com
1,I big on several projects. I was awarded several projects. To date only one amounted to anything and I have yet to be paid for the work done.,1,freelancer.com
2,"First, let me qualify myself by sharing that I'm a fulltime freelancer and that I use other sites and have extraordinary results. I am a top provider with hundreds of satisfied clients around the globe, so I speak from experience. I found Freelancer.com to be entirely useless, ineffectual and a total waste of time. When I closed my account, these gypsies continued to bill my PayPal and help themselves to MY MONEY; and they had the gall to act clueless for a MONTH as I endured a half-dozen back and forth email exchanges. As I tried to get these brainless airheads to return the money they took from me, I got the feeling that they may be trained to drag out the return/credit process as long as possible in order to hold onto the funds. Basically, Freelancer.com, from my perspective, offers ZILCH value for a legitimate fulltime freelancer. The site is antiquated, unsophisticated, and very unprofessional; and from my experience, I have no trust or faith in Freelancer.com. (*Also, take note of others' complaints that the site holds onto freelancers' money for a long time before remitting it. Had I seen THAT before, I'd have never bothered to explore the site, in the first place.) It's just my opinion, but I suspect that we'll see this site will fall on its face and go away before long. There's no way such a poorly-run, unprofessional, desperate business can sustain itself --",1,freelancer.com
3,"After several attempts to cancel my free trail. I contacted online chat support and was told at the beginning that it was still showing active. I was given a link to use to go cancel it again. the link took me to the same place I had already been each time. I asked support to cancel for me and send me confirmation. she then directed me to a more specific area in the link that still did not show the trial having been cancelled. I'm told to disregard to invoice. After this went on for to long, I closed my account. I've never had a company not give me any type of confirmation that a subscription was successfully cancelled.

5,"Why do you have a lot of fake reviews? All has the same content of words. Are you hiding flaws and issues? Anyway, this is a big joke. There are A LOT of fake employers and projects. Around 60% are fake. They have FEE for both employer and employee REGARDLESS if you get paid or not. My first project on freelancer, my emoloyer insisted to submit the work first before the milestone. The milestone should be created once awarded to avoid these scammers. You get ridiculous fees and you are the one to pay for the fees in sending. Imagine paying a $5 project fee with a pay of 30$ then you get another $0.42 because of the transaction fee.

7,"Simply because 99% of these 5 star reviews are fake reviews!  If you enjoy getting DOUBLE scammed, join up to freelancer, they will find ways to charge you for stuff you did not order and with the double chance that you will also get scammed from some freelance user.  However, If you reside in some 3rd world country, you can always get a job with freelancer that pays 15 cents/hour for writing fake reviews!  They also make you go through hoops to cancel your account. If you have a credit card or bank account listed with them, cancel asap!",1,freelancer.com
8,Another funny platform to break your head. recently i was awarded a project on freelancer.com and i completed the work within three days. To my surprise client deposits $5 and closes the project as Not Satisfied. there was no update from freelancer.com about the status. client got the work 100% completed for $5 and disappears. I reach the dispute forum and they say client is not satisfied and he closed the project. who the hell will judge what i have done and what is pending.  These people just need 5% that's it. my suggestion to my friends never apply for jobs who don't deposit money and on allotment of project request full amount as milestone and then start the work. We need to alert working with these freelancer.com they don't bother of your safety then why they charge 5% as frees.,1,freelancer.com
9,"I bid for project, employer gave the project created milestone. After work marked the milestone completed, after that I found that his profile got deleted because of some violation and freelancer reversed all payment. Because of such payment reversal process by freelancer, fraud people get ground to create violation of policy to get there money back, result in employee loss. And freelancer think them-self superior by removing profile and reversal of paid money. Actually freelancer is giving fraud people chance to have fraud with other working people.",1,freelancer.com
10,"In two words - STAY AWAY from these guys. I paid for their recruiters service and an NDA service a total of USD 30/- I posted a very descriptive job on their site explaining what I wanted. Their recruiter Giselle didn't even spend one minute reading it, and gave ignorance away with the Qs she asked me and her assessment of my requirement. This put me off immediately but now that i had paid them I had no choice but to continue. She then said she is scanning appropriate profiles but why dont I also start looking at the Freelancers who had applied. I told her, if this is what I wanted to do then I wouldn't have paid freelancers.com USD 30 to help in the recruiting! Finally she came up with ....drumrolls please...ONE freelancer. I thought I would get at least 5 to 6 names....anyway...I then asked her to recommend a few more as I needed to assess at least 3 profiles before making a decision. Furthermore, when I requested to TALK to her to explain my project requirements she decelined and said that I could TALK / SPEAK (this are her words) to the freelancers. I had made it clear to her that I needed a conversation with the freelancer before I made a decision to recruit them or make any further payments. Now, it so happens, all the freelancers I shorlisted - all have been unable to talk to me over skype as they claim it is a violation of some terms online. This is fine but my problem is why then did you not inform me of this? I specifically mentioned to Giselle the recruiter at Freelancer.com that I will need to talk to the short-listed web developers. Anyhow, Freelancers.com might have had a good idea one time of hiring recruiters to help people like me, but along the way they have totally lost it. They treat their clients like criminals who are out to rob them of their commissions.Im not saying this doesn't happen, but they should then be able to provide a phone link on their servers (which are only accessible when you award a project implying you make a payment to the freelancer) so that we can talk under their umbrella and calls can be recorded. People like me who are willing to pay for their premium services would infact like the added protection. As of now, I have requested a refund since no one has bothered to reply to any of me texts sent today. I will update this post once i hear back from them.",1,freelancer.com
11,Cam here to test their software and got banned in five minutes. Asked one the applicants for an interview and quickly found out it is against their terms of service for you to interview freelancers.  A very unreasonable and demanding bunch. Worst company I have worked with. surprised a company like this can survive. Felt extremely disrespected and confused. I have never been treated more inconsiderately by a company. I suppose it would be a great place if you are willing to hire a picture and text to work for you. Sounds like a great company to recruit a scam artist !,1,freelancer.com

Or the customer is told that he will not not get the code or the documentation if he does not give a 5 star rating.  Also If you reach freelancer for these issues they ask you to resolve these issues amongst yourself. We will not mediate is what they say. Typical responses on issues from Freelancer Support team. 1. I did not get the code - Sorry connect with your freelancer for this. 2. My project is not moving, the freelancer is not working - We do not mediate. That is not our role.

Of the other jobs I've bidded on, only one has been awarded and all the remainder have expired. Freelancer charges for everything. They charge for testing, they charge you for additional bids, they charge you if you are awarded a job, they charge the employer when they award you a job, they charge to sponsor your bids, they nickel and dime everybody for everything.

Besides that experience, you have the option to take a competency test based on the type of freelance work your searching for, like a writer would benefit from taking the English test. Each time you test it cost $5, and you need to be quick about taking the test because you'll run out of time. Whatever results you get will be visible on your profile and clients will be able to view them.

28,"Dear readers and fellow freelancers I was attracted by the freelancer.com reviews, most of which holding 5-star rating and nice narrations from other users (which are mostly manufactured by freelancer.com's paid review writers). at the beginning I found the site user friendly but with the course of time in the name of web development and facility enhancement for the users though the freelancer.com authority introduced some extraordinary ideas, within these they also set up the horrible plans of squeezing the users.  the site owners only give advantage to the clients and project advertisers and never help the contractors if their money is stolen by dint of malicious practices. I was robbed of my earned project fees even though I completed all necessary precautionary steps. so it seems to me there is some sort of connection between the ill motivated contractors and the freelancer.com authority.  since it is a virtual world and a contractor has very limited ability of raising a complain to legal authority so the freelancer.com takes this advantage. though it is their obligation to check and verify each and every contractors financial background but they don't do that as a mandatory practice. they allow everyone to launch a project in their site and those scrupulous clients get easy chance of cheating the hard earned contractors' money. whenever my money is stolen by a client the freelancer.com support team only indicated the reason as the client used an unauthorized payment source so his/her money is returned back. what a joke, who has to check whether a client's payment source is legal or illegal, do this falls on the responsibility of a contractor??? but what happened to my sorrow in the last two years is whenever money that I received in my escrow fund and then it is again sucked out from my account and diverted to the client, the freelancer.com team just advised me to be more vigilant. I am vigilant since the first incident of loosing money two years back occurred but I cannot control things which are under the only authority of freelancer.com team. the freelancer.com authority is straightaway linked to cyber crime, this authority must be brought under legal procedure otherwise many more innocent contractors will face financial demurrage. so it's time to raise voice against all illegal operations of freelancer.com and be alert about their dishonesty.",1,freelancer.com

(Your employer also has the liberty to cancel the project at any time, whether you've done the work or not.) - Is filled with scammers who waste your time (at best) - Is extremely difficult and complicated to use - Charges you a fee to accept a job (!!!) (A $5.40 fee for a $12 job, in my case) - Does not explain things well (I accidentally reported a perfectly innocent user because of an unclear button (typical of Freelancer) and spent a good amount of time trying to fix it, only to be brushed off by customer service after complaining that I was notified ""Action has been taken against the user you reported."" This is NOT the only time a non-explained button or process got me into trouble.) - Lets you work really hard and finish a project and THEN notifies you that in order to get paid you must ""verify your identity"" through a complicated process wherein, among other things, you take a picture of yourself holding your drivers license and a special number they give you, plus you must provide a proof of residence (they say a utility bill or a bank statement(!)), neither of which I have since I am 18 and live with my parents. Tough luck! Long and short of it, I was not paid on my first project (which, by the way, is also my last.) - Is full of low paying gigs that pay anywhere from $2.50-$5 per article (except for the rare high paying gig, more on those below) and these employers want you to work twelve hours per day on this laughable wage. - Does have nice employers who post projects offering decent wages--but in order to take on these jobs, you must have a LOT of reviews (from toiling away for the slave-labor employers, of course!) AND you might even have to upgrade your membership to get the job! - Made me get feel like I went gray overnight. - Told me I had 107 bids I could make--and then when I'd made less than fifty, it said I'd run out and couldn't place anymore. (?) - Is not a place where skilled, professional writers should expect to make money.

34,Title I provided is based on my experience yesterday when I was trying to bid for a project that was about providing IT support. To be able to bid it said I need to pass level 1 US english test. I dont know if job poster wants bidders to get certified or if it is freelancer itself making that decision. Note that one has to pay about 6$ to get certified. Test is on freelancer site itself and I believe is designed by them. The test questions are quite simple for anybody who has done English at school but I still ended up failing. The reason for failing I believe is tester gets 5 minutes to answer a ridiculous number of simple questions and it is designed so that one can't finish it in time. Basically it is designed so you retake the test and pay for it again. This company is definitely dodgy as I had similar experience another time where I just got charged a fee for clicking a link on my email to view the job request.,1,freelancer.com

47,"People come here to find an income, but it is common thing to pay more that you are hoping to get. I am a freelancer with several months experience, and using this site brought me a bit of grey hair. Most of ""employers"" are really speculators. They pick a project for, say, 300$ and search for a starving programmer who can complete it for 30$ or even 300 INR. The worst thing is that they find such people successfully. One disappointing trait of them is awful communication. They treat your as a slave (as ""talking instrument"") and command to you in impudent tone, ignore your questions and sometimes don't bother making payments. Such people/companies hunt for higher-price project on this site too, and shamelessly put their project with the same description once awarded. Another kind of employer is an obvious crook. They lure you into bidding and promise you a lot, but you should complete their job first (or even a ""testing task""). No need to say a scammer disappears as soon as he gets what he need. I have to say, there are bright stars of real, first-hand, promptly-paying and well-communicating customers too. Consider yourself lucky if you find one. In any case, the site takes its 10% fee as soon as you accept a project, no matter if you get paid or not. If the project owner is one of such crooks, you are at your own. Their support treats you as a human garbage. Don't expect even a response to your ticket after your account has been messed up by them! Generally, they turn their face to scammers and the opposite body part to honest workers. They have a strict ""walled garden"" policy, and openly persecute people for their attempts of direct communication. Freelancers, I mean, because an employer is a person of a higher sort, and he just receives a warning. There is no way for freelancers to communicate between themselves, and we cannot warn each other about a known scammer. It takes a lot of effort to maintain a good freelancer profile. It takes nothing for a freaky employer to leave you a worst rating for a completed and polished project. You have a finite number of available bids, and you have to pay if you need more. Any freak may just close a project you and others have bid on, and create it again hoping to get a lower quote. I am amazed to see a zillion of positive reviews. But most of them are equally short, dumb and full of uncertain buzzwords. Seems their support is working hard to make a false positive image of this cesspool. I've ever seen the same profile images for people pretending to be different. Their attitude takes so much of your nerves that terrible technical problems appear not so important. The site is painfully slow. Your stats become calculated wrong (as in 10 + 20 = 5). Your 5-star rating may just disappear, as do a part of your profile/reviews. The system may take a piece of your already received money just because there's a full moon. And you are at your own, because no matter what you do the site takes profit of it. And because everyone else is your competitor.",1,freelancer.com

89,"TLDR: Freelancer.com support agent single-handedly ruined my life. Freelancer.com is ruining my life, and the lives of thousands of contractors, it's not to be trusted nor used. My review is long but worth reading and will show you how no one in their right mind, should use it.  I've been a member in this platform for over 5 years, I'm in the top 0.5% of contractors, I have 57 reviews, and 56 of them are perfect 5 stars. I only mentioned all of this, to show you that if they're treating me this way, then imagine how they would treat other users. I had an issue with the website a while back, which I'll spare you the details of, that lead me to escalate the matter to get it solved, which I did. Prior to that issue, the website was placing a 2 months limitation on my account which stopped me from being paid or getting work, and after I resolved that I issue, I must have stepped on a few toes, because the day after, my account was placed under limitation once again. I contacted the website asking for an explanation, and the support agent rudely told me to stop asking questions and do my work, and they'll remove it when they feel like it. They didn't use these words, but it was the gest of it. I'm a proud person, and would never beg nor plead but i was put in a corner. A few months back my father passed away, and just a couple weeks later, i was in a bad car accident which left me in a bad shape and had to use all my savings to pay my medical bills. Right after that, the account was limited for two months as i mentioned earlier and i was barely getting by. But once the issue was resolved and the new ""open limitation"" was placed, i was desperate and strapped for cash. I had $3600 in my account which freelancer refused to allow me to withdraw, and at the same time I had bills piling up, so I contacted them appealing to their humanity and explaining that I did absolutely nothing wrong to deserve such treatment. I'm a well-respected person in my industry yet I was being treated like a criminal. It became clear later on that this limitation was placed by a support agent which I apparently angered during the first issue, and that the website had no basis nor reason to limit me. The first time I asked for the reason I was told that there's no reason and that I should keep working, then I was told that because a client complained, and in another occasion, i was told something else that I can't quite remember. At the end, they stopped making excuses and told me that the limitation will be lifted on the 4 of November, the date in which I'm writing this review. And I was told so on 5 separate occasions which I luckily have documented and asked for the Chat ID's (which is something you should always do when dealing with freelancer). A one-month limitation was hard and I didn't know if I can make it, but I basically had no choice, and they knew it. But a few days after this, the support agent that has something against me contacted me letting me know that she will only remove my limitation once I finish all my open projects, i tried to explain to her that this can't be, and that as a contractor I have no authority over clients to close projects, they can take forever with edits and improvements and new features, or just leave or any other scenario which I have no control over. I explained that my work is my life, that I will finish my work regardless because I have a responsibility toward my clients, and that how do they expect me to survive until then if my account is limited and I don't even have access to my money. And over our conversation that lasted a few weeks, i kept contacting freelancer and asking about the limitation and all the support agents assured me that it will be removed on the 4th, but she insisted that it won't, and apparently she won, because today I woke up, and indeed the limitation is still here. A support agent, that had something against me is ruining my life, is pushing me to depression and shortly homelessness. Last year around this time i was a successful business owner, and due to a series of misfortunate events, I have been reduced to this. Being treated like a thief or something, and constantly being threatened and told that my account can be suspended and deleted at any time. I gave 5 years to freelancer, I wholeheartedly trusted them, and one of their support agents basically ruined my life because I stepped on her toes. I'm at a loss for words, I don't know how I should feel, what I should do, the only clear thought in my mind is that I should warn people about this platform and tell them to stay the hell away. Whether you're a contractor or an employer, they will screw you mercilessly and you won't have a leg to stand on. If they did all of this to me, imagine what they would do to you...  PS: I heard of many cases where users had their accounts suspended after complaining about this platform. I realize the risk, and I'm taking it for you good people, so you know who you're dealing. And if my account does get suspended, I'll update my review and let you know.",1,freelancer.com

After the contest has ended, I asked Freelancer to give me a full refund because I couldn't find any logo that I like. * from Freelancer keep telling me my account is limited so they are not able to refund me.

I paid $80 with the idea that I would have at least a few decent designs to choose from of the 30+ they said would be submitted. RESULTS: 79 entries submitted. Of the 79, 23 had blatant copyright infringement (Minions and Pink Panther). Of the remaining 55 entries, 54 of them were either just writing or had nothing whatsoever to do with the theme (Example: a drawing of an astronaut, with no writing or anything to tie it to the theme. Another example: A quote about ""Me and My Best Friend"" with absolutely nothing to tie it to the provided theme.) I was left with one theoretically acceptable design, that I am now obligated to choose due to contest rules.

104,"Neil M Dallas, TexasMember since October 2017 Reviews | Comments | Account Settings | Bookmarks Reviews Youve Shared (1) Freelancer.com Horror Story This is absolutely the worst experience of any company in general that I ever had. I pay for the premium freelance service - 60 a month, to place unlimited bids. Out of nowhere, I receive an infraction claiming that it's because of the bids I'm making. Even though I literally pay for unlimited bids. Once the 24-hour infraction is lifted, I go back to bidding, obviously with more care this time, and elaborating further, to prove that I am a legit freelancer, and not spamming. Lo and behold, the mobile app will not let me bid, and claims that my app is restricted. For two whole days, support doesn't understand the problem...literally not reading my messages then replying ""ah, sorry, I answered my own question"" (I can provide screenshots)...because they are claiming it is ""general issues"". But I can bid from my laptop...and my mobile app is saying my account is restricted. A 3 year-old can determine that it is not ""general issues"". So now, unable to bid on the mobile app - I receive an infraction, this time they claim I posted my email address. The only time I posted my e-mail address is to clarify a dispute that my employer made for $111 after she released a milestone. Freelancer immediately froze me out of the money for the dispute, putting my account in the negative...which led to me bidding to more projects, which caused this whole chain reaction. So now, I have two infractions I shouldn't, and I am out $111....all while paying $60 a month for their supposed premium service. Contact me at @transcribing247 and I can recommend plenty of services other than freelancer.com. They will take your money, and then they will play dumb, as if they don't understand, when it comes to support. The support is literally so dense that I had to point out that one employer was trying to commit felony forgery by asking for my driver's license with responses like ""Maybe they just want to know where you are from"" Another time I told them about a racist message and they suggested that I ""not take it seriously"". This company is absolutely insane. I wouldn't recommend this company if they gave you a free membership. Bottom Line: No, I would not recommend this to a friend",1,freelancer.com

107,"Though I had been working both as freelancer and employer for the freelancer.com site and I have done many successful projects in both profile, recently my posted projects are getting fewer and fewer proposals as i myself realized i also hardly bid on projects due to their introduced repressive feature 'bid quality score' which has hardly any legit reason for determining the bid quality. I Myself take my bids on projects seriously and complete as much of the information that I understand. If nothing, I know my skills, and I don't apply for anything I am not qualified for and many employers send me messages after i place a bid for discussion on the project, but they keep on lowering my bid quality score- may be they want me to spend money to sponsor the bid or something. And for my posted projects too i can clearly see the response is getting crappier as i always welcome new comer freelancer to join a project if he/she has the skill. But after introducing this feature less freelancer are bidding and i am having to search for a suitable candidate for my project outside freelancer site. If this is a business strategy which is causing harassment for both freelancers and employers by the freelancer.com site then this is really disappointing and sad.

108,"If you check all the reviews before July, 2017 then you will find out real review from real clients. All the reviews that you see with 5 rating in a long series then be 100% that these are fabricated reviews added to sitejabber.com by its team. Freelancer.com has a team of content writers whose reposibilities are to produce fake and false postings whether it is be the projects listed on freelancer.com or 5 rating reviews on sitejabber.com or posting good image of their business on facebook page of freelancer.com, etc. Freelancer.com uses these content writers to do all the fake postings and this is why number of projects that you see posted on freelancer.com with ambiguous or very short or funny project descriptions are also posted by the same content writers team in order to trap sellers and buyers both. The world of freelancing.com was much better before this fraud and cheating world of freelancer.com acquired all the other good, honest and reputable freelancing sites like getafreelancer.com, vworker.com, limeexchange.com, etc. Matt Berrie's Freelancer.com has turned this whole freelacing industry into a complete fraud and scam due to one man's OWN greed, lack of vision, treating employers and potential service providers as his money making slave machines. Certainly freelancing business on the above mentioned marketplaces platforms was the reason of millions of families to earn their bread and butter which this goon, cheat, dishonest, thug, low character and low esteem guy has turned into a money snatch platform for buyers through imposing unjustified fees and made it slavery for employees who will always be doubtful whether they will get paid for all the hardwork they did or the money their client has released to give to them. Freelancer.com is doing fraud both way. It make unjustified transactions on employers card and try every possible way to find reasons of not paying hard earned money which a service provider has earned from his/her client. We wish and hope for a new platform to come and emerge on the model of vworker.com or getafreelancer.com so that we all good freelancers abandon this titanic who is continuously sinking from past 4 years every since Matt Barrie and his characterless and useless team is deployed to manage it all. Freelancer.coms acquiring of vworker.com, scriptlance.com, getafreelancer.com and limeexchange platform has caused us a waste of 15 years of time, efforts and life spent in this industry and business. The best revenge is to abandon and boycott the site and create a lack of good sellers or service providers which were ultimately result into lack of interest for the buyers to even think of this platform for quality and 100% successful project.  Also if we do forensic audit of the database of sellers on the site then I am sure that more than 80% are student sellers as most good sellers have already left the place and moved to other platforms like upwork.com or new emerging freelancing sites, etc. Stay away!",1,freelancer.com

116,"The company now boasts to have connected employers and freelancers globally from over 247 countries, regions and territories.  But talk to many freelancers who have used the site and a very different picture begins to emerge.  A cursory look at independent consumer review sites reveals an abnormally high volume of complaints about fraudulent activity conducted via the site and a lack of support when users get caught out. On the popular consumer review site, Sitejabber, Freelancer garnered only 1 and a half stars from almost 1000 reviews.  In the last month alone, 34 one-star reviews have been posted, with comments that make for sobering reading.  Freelancer took my money Moris N. Please sign the petition to save others Scam Its a similar story at Reviewopedia and highya, where Freelancer has garnered only 1 star from 127 reviews and 1 and a half stars from 131 reviews, respectively. At Trustpilot, freelancer.com received a Bad rating (2 out of 10) following 142 reviews. Complaints board an independent consumer news and database of rated complaints submitted by users is also littered with Freelancer.com grievances and details of scams being run via the site. These claims arent new to Freelancer and the company has attempted to deflect attention from security issues in the past. In March 2013, the Company placed a link its Facebook page entitled, Don't believe everything you read on the Internet: Lies, Scams and Freelancer.com the link now returns to the homepage, with the article apparently deleted. It is not difficult to find numerous articles, dedicated websites and even a change.org petition criticising the site or calling for action. Why all the smoke, if there is no fire? Stopping short of admitting a problem but seemingly aware, the company this year announced on its website that it was taking steps in its fight against fraud. Were serious about protecting all of our users from fraudulent transactions, and we are constantly working to ensure our site remains the safest and most secure place to hire or find work. Today were introducing a new weapon in our fight against fraud - the security period. Effective January 18, 2016, a small number of transactions will be locked for a security period of between 7 and 15 days. Special Investigation: Having briefly trialled the site following its debut on the ASX, I completed a couple of projects and developed a 4 and a half star rating before encountering fraudulent users. I decided to return to see if the companys new security measures had provided improved protection for freelancers.  I paid to complete some site-based exams to improve my profile, uploaded my portfolio and set about bidding on jobs.  Before long, I received a system-generated email: Congratulations Nick Ashdown saw your profile and wants to hire you directly!  Ready to start work? Don't wait too long, accept before Nick Ashdown offers it to someone else!  The email link took me to a job listing where I had previously placed a bid. A chat window was already open and Nick greeted me in second-language level English.  Nick was a clean-cut male in the photo (a small flag indicated he was currently based in the UK), with a credible profile blurb about being a graphic designer. English wasnt his first language (he said he was European) and he needed someone to professionally edit a technical document in English. His account was indicated with a large green-lit tick, directly underneath the employers details with the words verified. Hovering a cursor over the symbol indicated that the user had made a financial deposit. To a new freelancer, the listing provided scant warning to suggest that the employer had not been in some way secured. Only that he was new to the site, with a high-value project and no reviews, which is far from unusual the site. For all intensive purposes his biography, photo and the project itself, looked genuine. He was verified financially by email and phone. Only under closer inspection (hovering a mouse over a small icon) does it inform that the employer has not completed profile 100%.  To the uninitiated however, the general impression is certainly one of some kind of security. Milestones Within its FAQs, the company recommends Freelancers request a milestone payment before doing any work. Only the employer can create a milestone payment and make the release.  Requesting a milestone would certainly limit the possibility of being defrauded but for many new freelancers, it also limits the possibility of being hired.  Many employers are understandably wary of working with freelancers with no record. Lacking a developed profile with ratings and reviews, new freelancers are at an immediate disadvantage.  They are also more likely to forgo requesting a milestone payment upfront out of fear they will miss out on the work. Anyone arriving at a job advertisement from a system-generated email will also be encouraged to accept quickly, to not miss out, and the default milestone is set at no milestone (100%). Verified Nick Disappears Nick and I began a discussion and agreed to a rate of $200 for editing the technical 2000 word article.  I decided to proceed by accepting the project and after completing it, sent it to Nick in the chat window who gratefully received it and told me he would check it and get back to me shortly.  That was the last I heard from him. I returned a few hours later to find the project had been cancelled and deleted from my work history. A message on my timeline simply read: Your project has been deleted by your employer Nick Ashdown. This project can no longer be accessed or showcased, but your feedback can still be viewed from your profile. What happened to my work is anyones guess. It was possibly submitted to a genuine employer on Freelancer.com or elsewhere and likely passed off as the work of whoever Nick Ashton was. Seemingly $200 out of pocket, I contacted Freelancers Live Chat to see what options the company presented to me.  As the employer had the green verified tick and other verifications, I assumed there would be some course of action I could take. GF: We have deleted the accounts and the project due to their issue, Gary F told me.  GF: They have violated our Terms and Conditions. Thus, we have closed their account.  Me: But the account was verified. And the work I submitted? GF: We can no longer return the payment. Me: Well can I speak with a manager? GF: We do not have any manager (sic) available.  Not exactly going the extra mile, but Live Chats Gary F was quite right.  Once the company deems a user has violated the company's Terms and Conditions, the user's account can by closed at any time.  Scant comfort for a new freelancer, who is encouraged to bid on expensive project, have it accepted and a fee deducted, only for it to be deleted without warning, leaving the freelancer out of pocket. Only Freelancer.com will not be out of pocket it seems. Project Fees Freelancer.coms project fees are taken irrespective of any accepted project, verified or not, real or not, deleted or not. Freelancer.com clearly states, for fixed price projects, if you are awarded a project, and you accept, we charge you a small project fee relative to the value of the selected bid, as an introduction fee.  The fee for fixed price projects is 10% or $5.50 AUD, whichever is greater, and 10% for hourly projects. When Nick awarded me the project and I accepted, I was automatically charged the introduction fee and it wasnt returned when Nick Ashdowns profile and project were abruptly deleted for violating the companys terms and conditions. The fee was also deducted despite having no money in my Freelancer account - my account was now sitting at -$22.  I contacted Live Chat once again where Jeri F confirmed my suspicions.  The project fee is generally non-refundable because it serves as an introduction fee to freelancers and employers for using our site's services. Expressing dismay that I could be charged a fee from a fraudulent listing on their site, she eventually offered to forward a refund request for the project fee for that project.  I have since been refunded for the fee on that transaction, but Nick and the $200, have gone forever.  It is clear that in the event of a freelancer accepting a project from a fraudulent employer, the onus is on the freelancer to identify the fee and chase up the company for its return.  This is despite potentially being already out of pocket from a fraudulent user, who was free to post a credible looking job listing and profile on the site. Unverified I later bid on a high-value project, this time from an unverified employer requesting a ghostwriter.  He awarded me the project and engaged me in discussing details. I accepted (was charged the project fee) and he then tried luring me to Skype - something Freelancer.com quite rightly doesnt recommend.  When questioned, he disappeared, leaving the project open. The project fee for the unverified project remained debited from my account and my balance is now sitting at -$91. It is questionable as to why you would even allow unverified employers to list on the site in the first place? It makes for a dangerous place for a new freelancer to try and ply their trade and build a name.  A look through the projects listed on Freelancer.com, reveals a large number of new, unverified and partially verified employers with high budget projects. The higher the budget, the higher the commission freelancer.com receives when an awarded project is accepted. The fee structure also sees the Company benefit from the highest volume possible of projects being accepted. If the Company draws revenue from any awarded project being accepted, it begs the question of how serious the company is, about purging suspect projects, before they are accepted. After all, the company does boast to being the largest of its type by total number of users and projects posted.  Nothing to See Here Freelancer.com is a site where many legitimate employers and freelancers from all over the world meet and successfully do business.  During my months on the site, I successfully completed a few projects and had some good experiences with genuine employers.  However, in over 20 interactions, I encountered nearly as many suspect or clearly fraudulent users, as I did genuine ones. I also had three projects abruptly and belatedly cancelled, after I had accepted the awarded projects. Freelancer.com may well be the worlds largest freelancing and crowdsourcing marketplace by total number of users and projects posted. But how many of those are genuine is open for debate.  If only a small proportion of users are not genuine, it calls into question the Companys numbers when claiming to connect over 16,183,045 employers and freelancers globally. On the site, the company also declares it is a community that values your trust and safety as our number one priority. If that were true, wouldnt the company automatically refund the project fee they deducted from the freelancer, when they belatedly delete an in-progress project from a fraudulent user? Leaving a potentially defrauded freelancer to chase after a project fee, from a project that shouldnt have been listed in the first place, does not sound like a number one priority.  What is clear is that any freelancers considering using the site, need to be very careful and do extensive research before or posting a project. Freelancer.com CEO, Matt Barrie could not be reached to comment on this story. The Companys head office phone number is not listed on the site or on his personal website. I did, however, receive a response from Freelancer.com support, with the company continuing to deny there is a major security issue. We keep our site safe for both freelancers and employers. We have security measures to ensure that only quality bidders can employers can transact on our site.  We expect our user's capability to discern every participation, negotiation, and any agreement they will enter into one other. Once again, the onus is on the freelancer to protect themselves and clean up the site by reporting any violation not that it will do the Freelancer any good in recouping work already lost. Last month, Freelancer.com announced it added two more Webby Awards to its name, now having a total of 10 in five short years. We are redefining employment with the Internet, creating a secure marketplace that empowers employers and freelancers from around the world by helping them connect with each other, Matt Barrie, Chief Executive of Freelancer.com said in the statement. But if you ask many freelancers who have used the site, Freelancer.com is anything but secure and could do with living up to its claims. Australian investors would likewise to be cautious in investing in Freelancer.com until the company can demonstrate a marked improvement in on site security.",1,freelancer.com

131,"I am an old Freelancer with Freelancer.com. Though freelancer is providing a lot benefits to it's users but Freelancer.com is Money Eating Engine. Their vision is only to Earn Money through good or bad, not with the vision of helping the community. I did a project with an Employer (client name is hidden due to privacy agreement) on a project. She released a payment for the project. We delivered them the project and after sometimes, it was observed that payments in my account are locked total of $2400. I received an Email from Freelancer that it will be unlocked if dispute is resolved in your favor. I kept following up with their support and they said that we are waiting for employer to resolve matter with their account. After some days I received email from employer stating that dispute is done in Freelancer.com favor and she didn't want to contact me or Freelancer anymore because she said I am done. Now where is that MONEY ? In Freelancer.com SCAM BOX ? This is not the first time. If employer make a charge back, and freelancer does the dispute and inform their freelancer only once that dispute is being handled. But later we never know even if dispute is won in Freelancer.com favor they never inform you and keep that amount with them. This is their best strategy to screw the users and they talk about Terms and Conditions. Unfair ways.

I am fighting to get my money back and once I succeed I will delete my account forever. This couldn't be worst!",1,freelancer.com
139,"What is going on with Freelancer? It really seems the longer I am with this site the harder it becomes for me to find work. I'll elaborate. 1) My biggest issue recently; the new bid proposal system. Literally this system is the worst change I have seen to Freelancer since I have been with the site. Why is it I am only allowed to type about 2 sentences for my proposal for complex projects like webscraping where every site and the challenges it presents are different? It is becoming literally impossible for me to stand out from anyone else because all I can put is ""I am an expert in webscraping blah blah"". I can't elaborate on how I would accomplish the project or tackle its challenges or why my work would be superior/unique. Please for the love of god revert this system. 2) The changes to chat have the made the site a LOT slower. Everytime I load up a page it reloads all my chats and the javascript takes forever to complete in addition to the actual chat boxes lagging when I try to type. This makes it take longer for me to scan the site for projects and place bids and reduces my overall efficiency. 3) The new bid sponsor system is terrible and I never use it because now it costs me $30 to sponsor a bid when it used to cost a few dollars. This is money I DO NOT get back if I am not awarded the project so why would I risk 10% or more of the actual project payout in an attempt to stand out. 4) Why am I charged when I deposit funds into my Freelancer account when I am also charged a high % on milestones I am paid? Honestly I don't know if its greed or a need to change for the sake of change but so much of what has been done in the past year has hindered my success as a Freelancer with the site rather than help it. I am thankful for the Preferred Freelancer program but everything else that has been done is awful and might look nice on the surface but does not help the actual Freelancer at all which is surprising considering the sites name. One simple change I can think of that would be amazing is let Preferred Freelancers initiate chats with employers. None of us are going to spam the employer we would simply say ""Hello I am X and I am very interested in your project. Here is how I would complete it to your satisfaction, etc"".

This situation lasted about 10 months, then I received an email stating that the amount was reversed to my client's bank due to fraudulent activity. Who made it? I don't know. Furthermore, my client's account was blocked and I can't contact him. I asked FL to give me his contact details, but did not have any support. At the end of the day, FL charged me all the losses associated with this fraud. I was completely dissatisfied with this approach, as a top-rated reputable freelancer here...

Why? Because they lie. They could even say and display the url, but it's not always them who did it.

181,"Everything started when I opened a claim against them on Paypal, due to a service not being provided properly and also they weren't responding to my complaints. After escalating the case to Paypal, they straight away kept in touch. Foolishly, I cancelled the claim and here is where my nightmare started. My account has been limited since then and every time I tried to communicate with them, they just didn't reply. Due to the account limitation, I had money locked on it, projects already paid which I can't download the files and the worst thing: they are chasing one of the freelancers whom worked for me a while ago and trying to play dirty.  Basically they have limited his account as well and the money he had on that time. And now they say that the only way to recover his money is if they convince me to speak directly to them. This won't happen at all. Now I am only using paypal resolution center to communicate with them. I can see that they don't give a damn about paypal (they never post messages there), but I am taking this very seriously. The feeling I have is the same I've seen everywhere else: they just want to make a huge profit and not worry about doing their obligations.

There are no options to talk to the employer as they once were. There is no possibility to send a file to your employer as an example when you bid.After bidding, there is a ranking of freelancers bidding on ""abilities"" but I can say it's a mess.

Seven good years of my life went down with this company.  Before then, I signed up with script lance site which later sold to them my info was transferred to freelancer.com by chance( I didn't just find myself there intentionally considering the circumstance) The first few months, I discovered their non-refundable commission policy which they use to scam both buyers and workers. They can collect lots of money from your account without explanations. after a task is done, they will still collect money and when an employer files a chargeback from the bank, they won't investigate the issue but claims 50% of the charge & give the employer 50% whereby encouraging work without pay while they accomplice the employer to steal from you. Most case, if you get a new employer who didn't know anything about freelancer.com tricks and weakness, you will get paid but once you meet their partners in crime, you're screwed for good. A lot of stuffs are going on there that I wonder why the crime investigation team on the Internet haven't shutdown that site. The latest scam plot between freelancer and the employers is to claim that milestone is released to you while the employer file for a chargeback from the bank and recieve a total refund and you lose your file to them.  I have struggled with this issue for months now and an employer I worked for 4months ago with good review given to me, didn't file a chargeback but there is an issue of chargeback filed by freelancer on behalf of the employer. How did I find out, I talked with the employer and he told me clearly that he didn't have any issues with me. Infact he still appreciates the task I did for him. I asked him to contact freelancer.com and he did but they asked him to provide vital government based info with other credit card details and he sensed the fradulent plan and refused. The employer replied to me with this comment ""That site is evil"" he encouraged me to use other platform but I wanted to get to the root of the matter by contacting freelancer.com customer service who claimed that the employer refused to further verify his identity. I asked them what that has to do with the chargeback claims (because it's obvious the employer didn't file dispute and the task I did 4months ago. Till now this people haven't replied, they took 350 Australian dollars from my account and refuse to give me back my money.

However, it is better to remove the contest that will cause liabilities to users and to us even if the contest is Guaranteed.

199,"A PURE SCAM SITE - WAVE YOUR MONEY GOODBYE I have been hiring freelancers for at least 5 years now. I have tried and used all the websites out there which provide services of this kind. But let me tell you what I have experienced at Freelancer.com 2 weeks ago I posted a job on Freelancer.com. I then uploaded money to Freelancer.com, in order to pay one freelancer for a completed translation job. However, Freelancer.com DID NOT pay out the money to my freelancer. No - what they did, was to follow their usual routine of trying all the tricks in the book, in order to hold the money on their account. My freelancer had to face a myriad of various verifications, unreasonable and even ridiculous requests and requirements - but even though she complied with them all, money WERE NOT PAID OUT, till this very day. My freelancer finally wrote to me, that she had lost any hope to get the money from Freelancer, and that she will rather let Freelancer keep the money. However, I have conscience, and cannot let someone do the job without getting paid - so I encouraged her not to give up, and now took the matter into my own hands. I submitted a support ticket, in which I clearly demanded Freelance.com to either pay my money to my freelancer, or to return the money to my credit card. 2 business days have past since then - no answer whatsoever - a complete silence. What I can tell with 100% certainty, is that Freelancer.com staff has a very clear set of instructions, set up and given to them by the very top-leadership of the company. Since the majority of freelancers come from the 3rd world countries such as India and Pakistan, Indonesia etc., this scam site Freelancer.com knows that an average person from these countries, with poor English skills and zero knowledge of relevant laws, has no chance to fight back and force Freelancer.com to pay out the money. So what Freelancer.com does - they gladly allow freelancers to sign-up and immediately participate and place bid on the projects. They also gladly accept money from the hiring parties, such as me - no verification needed. Just send the money, man! But once the money are uploaded to their account - oh boy - that's when the party starts. Suddenly they become very concerned with security (allegedly - your own security!) and now need to ""verify"" both the freelancer and the hiring agent. Again - they didn't need any verifications in order to accept your money. So - after they receive your money, they immediately create a ""Wall of Verification"". First they demand an ID copy (which, by the way, is illegal under both Australian law, and law of the most countries - private companies HAVE NO LEGAL RIGHT to demand copies of one's ID, as long the customer does not ask for services or products in credit). Now, if a freelancer from Pakistan or India complies with the illegal demand, and indeed sends their ID copy, Freelancer.com starts to demand for an ID in English letters - despite having the many years practice, and despite already knowing very well that IDs from these countries are only issued in native script. Then they ask for bank statements, and if a freelancer has no bank account (for example, a teenager or a woman from Asian countries) - sorry, we can't give you your money. Then, if by a miracle a freelancer somehow manages to satisfy all they demands, Freelancer.com then starts from the other end - starts ""verifying"" the hiring agent. Now, if the hiring agent has some understanding of the relevant laws, and refuses to send any sensitive IDs - they will simply keep the money. Like I said - all of this is done deliberately, hoping that freelancers, especially those from 3rd world countries, after many unsuccessful attempts will finally lose patience and hope, and give up on their money held by Freelancer.com. Because, as in my case, if the payment is around 250, then the chances are slim that the average freelancer will ever get enough projects to generate the same amount in form of fees. And even if Freelancer.com is finally forced to pay out the money ( I guess 1 out 20 Asians probably manage achieve this), most often Freelancer.com will have kept the money for significant amounts of time, without paying the money owner any interest. In practice, this means that they daily get massive free loans, which, very often, are not even paid back. I assume, this startegy alone generates around 50% of Freelancer.com revenue. So now, as of today, Freelancer.com official excuse to hold my freelancer's money, is that they are ""reviewing"" my - the hiring agent's account. They asked me to send them a copy of my ID - something that no private company can demand. Of course, I am not going to send any copies of my IDs or other sensitive douments, because of 2 reasons: 1. such request is simply illegal - IDs are highly sensitive personal documents, and only official state institutions can demand for it - not private companies as this one. 2. at least ninety percent (90%) of Freelancer.com customer support are outsourced to namely India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, etc. This means that their customer support is based in these countries. Any documents that you upload to Freelancer.com, can be accessed with one click by hundreds of 3rd world nationals, who can (and will) easily abuse and forge your ID and use it for financial crimes or terrorism. Like I said, I have been hiring freelancers for many years, and I know these tactics in and out. However, I must say that Freelancer.com scores highest, as the most fraudulent site of them all. I am going to draw their criminal practices into the daylight. If you are a freelancer or a hiring party, remember, that I and my freelancer are not the only people whose money have been literraly stolen - Google up ""freelancer.com scam"" and read about them in Wikipedia. A pure scam site. An update will follow.",1,freelancer.com

201,"So I've had my account for a few months but I wasn't active until about a week ago. Once I was active it was a pain in my rear end. The first offer I got told me to email her and basically wanted me to work off the site (and what she proposed sounded a lot like some kind of money related scam) the second offer was someone who wanted me to sell stuff on ebay (he used what he called a 'disposable account' and deleted it right away)  here's where it got sticky. I pressed the link in the email that said 'view and accept your project' thinking it would take me to a page that I could accept or reject but in reality kt automatically accepted the project. This left me with a dummy project and a $25 charge on my account. The customer service rep was nice enough, she seemed to misunderstand me a bunch but after some time I got her to withdraw the charge.  I immediately closed my account. It's basically a site full of scammers run by people who are not fluent in English. They make bank on the non-refundable charges and do not care if the account that offered was closed before the offer was accepted.

The problem is that you find these so called companies over in India that uses different names, different profiles, fake samples of their work. along with fake reviews to lure you in. Everything was going great during the milestone, the person I connected with via Skype seemed to understand every aspect and functionality that I needed to design my web page. My project was broken down into 5 milestones, and somewhere along the 3rd milestone is where everything went south. All of a sudden the person that I had been communicating with for months sounded different, and I kept repeating myself consistently when he had understood exactly what I wanted during the initial phases of the project. My gut was telling me that I was now dealing with a different person because this one had terrible English over the phone, and the tone and grammar in his emails were totally different. Unbeknownst to me, they had sold my project to another company and their job was to pick up where the other goon had left off. It was a complete disaster, but because I had already invested over 3k in the initial milestones I was at the point of no return. I had no choice but to move forward with the project, I saw my hopes and dreams of this fabulous website disappearing before my eyes, they barely understood what I wanted, and the design was poorly done the functionality had all kinds of bugs in it, they would lie and tell me that they fixed it, only to go in and it had not been corrected. They barely had any design or coding skills, and I am quite sure the first dude sold this project to them for pennies. I had to go along with whatever they could do. Here is where the extortion comes in, a few days before the project was wrapping up, they reached out to me and said that if I want them to maintain my website and since they are familiar with the coding and design, it would be better for me to use them for this service. Then they added if I want their developer to continue to do a good job on the final phase, that I need to go out and give them a five-star review. Again, out of fear that they would put a bug in the final phase of the project, I reluctantly gave them a 5 star review, when they deserved zero stars. My website has so many glitches and bugs that it's just a sitting duck. I will never use Freelancer, as this is just a way to hustle Americans out of their hard-earned cash. The worse part is that once you give a review, you cannot go back and modify it once the project has been completed.",1,freelancer.com

(at this point I was on the trial and had no interest in paying). So I hopped over to the customer help immediately and did manage to speak to a rep, when I explained that there had been no confirmation and I hadnt used any features she then printed out a list of the T&C's that I had signed when I registered, I kept at her, saying that I had only been registered for one day, with 30 days left on my trial why would I choose to pay for it. Eventually she managed to process a refund for me, great I thought - not too painful as I left the chat. Except the refund she gave me was in their site credit. So with £40 in credit, I thought the easiest way around their pesky system would be to withdraw it like you would do with your earnings - nope. The withdraw system apparently doesnt work for ""deposits"".  Again, seriously frustrated I messaged into the chat. This time my case was forwarded onto the finance department which returned my money a day or two later.

249,"Hi everybody, I have been working in freelancer.com for more than 6 years now.  I'm one of the most reviewed freelancers in the translation field, so I would actually love that freelancer.com would treat their users honestly and would not cheat them, because I got a lot projects from this site, and they are playing all the cards to make people stop using it which would damange my company profits. I will tell you about my last experience: I accepted a project for a new client, for a total of 600$. Before accepting the project, I always require the client to create the full milestone payment in order to have a payment guarantee. (For the people who does not know what a milestone is: a milestone payment is a payment that is frozen in the project and taken from the client's account, and once the project is completed the client click on ""release"" button and then it arrives to the freelancer's account. This way both parties are some kind ""assured"".) The client created the milestone so I accepted the project. After accepting the project freelancer.com takes his fee (5%) so they took their 30$. I started working on the project for many days and then I delivered it to the client. The client, quickly replied me that everything was okay with the translation and that he would release the payment. Then, after few minutes, the client came back again to me and said that freelancer.com did not allow him to release the milestone because his account was under verification revision. This is the first big incompetent thing of the site - why do freelancer.com allow a client to create project, and a milestone payment and start hiring for services when he/she even have not been verified? The answer is simple, because they want to to steal your fee. I told the client not to worry, that we would wait. Then we waited 2 weeks and freelancer.com did not approve the verification of his account. Then the client decided that he would cancel his account and he would pay me by Paypal if freelancer.com did not solve the issue. I warned him that it was against the Terms and Conditions of freelancer.com and that they could suspend our accounts. He decided to open a dispute with his payment method supplier against freelancer.com and to cancel the project. He cancelled the project and my milestone payment dissapeard, without me being notified about it by freelancer.com nor even being able to dispute this milestone. This is the second big incompetent way of working of freelancer.com. Why do they offer a milestone payment service if later, the client can just cancel the project (after you have delivered your work) and run away with your money? This is just unbelievable and against any kind of protection policy for their users. Thanks God the client was a good person and he did not want to cheat me and said that I should not worry because he would pay me once the verification process was over. I calmed down a little bit because my 600$ were not totally lost... but then I remembered about the 30$ fee that freelancer had charged me. I checked my transaction history and show that they had not refunded it, therefore I contacted them via chat. I explained them the situation and told them that they should give the fee back to my account, because the project had been cancelled and I had not yet being paid a dollar from that project. Then, their reply was the cleverest thing I have ever heard. They just said me that their Terms and Conditions said the project fees are not refunded. I started wondering if I was speaking with a robot... ""Yes, but the project is cancelled, no earning made through it, why should I pay for a project where I have not made any profit?"". And the reply was: ""Note that our Terms and Conditions are to be met. For next time, you should explore your options before accepting a project"".... Worst customer service ever! How can you treat like that to a client? So you're telling me that you're cheating without even trying to hide it? So they don't protect their freelancers and allow that a client can cancel a project and a payment whenever he wants, and moreover they don't fund back the fees to the freelancer from projects that have been cancelled by the client. So if you're a freelancer you are double $#*!*d, the client goes away without paying you and freelancer charges you his marvelous fee! I feel really dissapointed with them, actually cheated. They should respect their users and most important, they should respect their freelancer's work and efforts. They should keep in mind that the slavery period hopeful ended and that we work for money and that our time is valious.",1,freelancer.com

You would think its 2017, it's a website; it's easy, current in supply & demand.  But if you delete your post, Ahhh a fee is debited from any account you have linked. Do they tell you that? Does the site make that known in any way? Nope!! How about awarding a project to a freelancer; pressing that button will result in a shock that comes when you have no idea it's coming. You'd think the system would simply say, project cost determined ""X"", fee associated ""X""!! Oh no, it doesn't.  Not an email, message, advisement or communication prior to the debit. I get fees. I get costs. What I don't get is a company that would take money with no fair warning.  You just get the surprise of a lifetime by the scam of the platform sending you an email saying these funds have been debited. Not a detailed description or warning or clarification what so ever.  And if you get this radical surprise and you are in a panic, feel cheated and want to talk to a customer service person, any person who can possibly explain why this isn't communicated, why it isn't clear so you can feel confident about working with a completely virtual process, you get an equally as frustrating run around.

Some Job Hunting persons(registered user as want a Job) are scammers too. I therefore conclude that Freelancer.com website is were scammers meet up.

But most of them was not related to my request, and very low quality.  Then I decided to close my project because these are something I cant hire. First I contacted the costumer support and the person named Rochelle J said they will refund. Then later another person contacted me and they said they cant close my project and cant refund because it was Guaranteed project. They said Guaranteed means that it was guaranteed for the freelancers that someone get the job. (They have ""Guaranteed project"" and ""Money Back Guaranteed project"". Which sounds confusing. They said I would have money back if I chosen ""Money back guaranteed"" project.) And as I dispute my transection through PayPal , Then they stopped my account and closed my project. Which I don't get provided anything. Even they closed my project they still have my $169. I simply didnt receive anything from them and I paid $169. Freelancer.com said to me that they can reopen project but I don't want to use the service anymore because the quality is very low like if 5-year-old children worked on them. Also my project is already over and I just want to have my money back. I didn't get provide anything from them and they hold my $169.  2.. They present the word ""Guaranteed"" to the client in the purchasing process. Which doesn't mean its ""money back guaranteed "" but its guaranteed FOR FREELANCERS that someone would get hired even the client is not happy with the works. Isn't it kind of tricking or scam? If guaranteed not means to the client, shouldn't they use other words to describe? (""Not money back guaranteed"" etc...) Because I thought it was money back guaranteed.

I have said it before and will say it once more: STAY AWAY FROM THIS RUBBISH SITE!",1,freelancer.com
303,"1. First I will talk about their ""guaranteed"" contests. You can submit free work and they say they will guarantee the payment, I participated in a guaranteed contest with ID 878221 and client asked me several times for modifications which I did. Time passed I waited for a winner (I was top contestant, but I was not picked by client and client disappeared). Now according to their policies it was freelancer.com's job to come in and distribute reward among top entries but what they did was unbelievable. They DELETED the ""guaranteed"" contest without rewarding any freelancer. Now read the response from their support team: ""We recently have done some improvement to make the site more secured for valuable users, like you. Hence, the system automatically deletes contests that may cause liability to us and its users. On a different note, you may earn more from contests when you are picked a winner. This will give you higher earnings, good ratings, and feedback, which will help you be awarded more contests and/or projects."" 2. Second kind of fraud is more pathetic and shameless, you apply for a job, you are hired, you are paid, project ends, you receive 5 star feedback. WOW great! But after that they can close the project take back money form your account, yes trust me they did this. My money was stolen after I received 5 star feedback form client. Don't know if it went back to client's pocket or Matt Barrie's pocket I don't care but this is a fact they can screw you at anytime, it could have made sense if I was kicked when project was not complete but doing this after project is closed and feed backs are exchanged is the most shameless scam I ever faced. I have screenshots of these scams and I am sharing for those who believe it is not possible on earth.",1,freelancer.com
304,They did not let me know they where taking money from my account. I just looked at my bank statement. I was like my goodness what is this payment for. I was under the guise that i was making a one time payment for the ability to make bids and be verified. Little did i know they where taking 10$ a month from me after that. When i send them a email expressing my concern they tell me to wait until the end of month to cancel because then i would be waisting money. In the email when i told them to cancel it they just told me to. There is no phone number to call and they will not refund me. Scam alert stay away... dont give them your info.,1,freelancer.com

I had tried to do that before without success and without any feedback about the reason.  I will try this again. I will upload my driver licence and for the id document and a digital photo of a bank issue. I will alter the document because You shouldn't know anything about the credit limit, last balance, card number, or anything else. I thinks is too much information and I will never give you all that information and if I get hacked be sure I will take action about that because unique people that I will provide too much information about me is to you.... And yes, I don't trust in you but I'm just playing your game, because you don't trust in my and ask me to give you validation of everything, but you can hack me.  I will try again but, you should accept that you are asking a lot of data, I'm also thinking to open a thread in quora about that because is too dangerous to allow a company to know everything about you. You could lost control of one employ and my data can be leaked.  I think is too offensive your politics about identification and worst the address section is just bad as trash, you ask me about postal code... but in my country we don't use that information, so why $#*!ing $#*! is that field required? is freelancer a page done only for us workers?  I'm pretty upset with freelancer, I think is just horrible and I hope some better service come to the community of freelancer because you don't care about giving a good service, you just want take money from what people work. I hope that I can transfer my money as soon as possible. After that, I will delete my account and I and not just deleted , I want that all register about me be removed from database, backups, hard disk, memories, papers, your mind, from everything, I won't never use freelancer and I won't never recommend you, conversely I will give a very but immensely bad feedback to anyone. And I won't like your service support, I had already told you that is horrible, it take days in answer. So If you want, validate my identity if no well don't do it, just give me my money and forget about me.  Do you know what..., I had decided to cancel the verification, I'm just upset, if you want a validation I can send you my id and the code but not a bank issue or anything else. You are pretty mistrustful people, you think everybody will try you cheat you. No, not everybody is trying to cheat you, I'm just a young man that worked for a mexican for one month for just $350, you got your money and I want my money because after all, I was who did the job. And look this https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/www.freelancer.com everybody hate you. Last I just want my money in the bank account. All my money.

The site even requires a $5 payment to delete these fictitious ""projects"" the auto-script creates - can you believe it? I just closed my laptop and will never, ever, ever log onto Freelancer.com again.  It was insane, and this site is the absolute worst on the Internet.

309,"I had a project and found a contractor and set up milestone payments etc. On the day I noticed that freelancer.com made 2 charges, one a full amount for the project, and the other a portion of the project amount (one of the milestone payment). When I found that a double charge was made, I wrote to them and was told that the money will be refunded. In a week or so when I checked my PayPal account, the money was not returned, and since then nightmare began.  Since freelancer.com knows and acknowledged that a double charge was made, they could have simply returned the credit to my PayPal account, and this is what a ""normal"" person would expect from a ""normal"" business operation. Instead, freelancer.com has been coming up with all kind of B...S... not to returning the money. Worse yet, they are NOT even paying the contractor, although all milestones are met, and payment to contractor from the money that is already fully paid by me to them on the first day of project start, is simply amazing business practice I can not imagine. They are blaming that my account is locked (or ""limited access"") and blaming me and my dispute for asking for money back that they took illegally as the reason. How clever!! I am still fighting to get my money back that they should not have taken from me. I must say DO NOT GET NEAR THIS SITE/VENDOR. THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN CON OPERATION or SIMPLE THIEF. P.S.

During that period I had seen many situations and had taken a part starting from unfounded complaints to unfounded refunds. This is normal practice for Freelancer.com to hold or block money and get them back. This is normal when you had taken a project and after 2-3 days of your work (spent time) you got a letter from Support that the Employer's account had been blocked and they had to refund. This is normal that after 2-3 month any employer can claim or create a dispute on the Milestone's which had been released and get money back. This is normal when the Dispute Team acts like a judge ignoring agreement and listing between Users. I think many other freelancers can add own situations to the list. The absurdity lies in the fact that if I have in the account the money I have earned for months, they can block them all and return back anytime.

When I contacted Freelancer for a refund, they told me that the money would NOT be refunded even though I never actually did any work or earned any money. They said that the $60 charge I paid was their fee for ""introducing"" me to the employer.

349,"I made the mistake if trying Freelancer.Com inspite of the overwhelming negative reviews. The reason I was tempted is because they were running a promotion where the freelancer would not pay any commission. Which sadly turned out to be a scam as well. The site service itself is a bunch of fetaures loosly cobbled together with a workflow that barely works if at all. Most things have at lease 6 ways to get to them. Example payments to freelancers are done via these things called milestones. there are at least 3 different ways of accessing these milestones and depending on which method the functionality set is all different. Also with this example there is no clear navigation hierarchy to get to these. In short the freelancer.com portal is a poorly written almost cobbled together piece of junk. To make matters worse the executive management who decide how to run this company have absolutely no integrity: A company that does not honor its word really has no future in the internet market. They will run promotions but have absolutely no intention of honoring that. The following chat transcript will help you understand.

Therefore if I should at a later date question anyone about this then they can just say well we dont know what the issue is about on the ticket 22:09 Tikiri Wickramasingha: so in short no commital 22:09 Lorraine A.: I had put the title referral code, when they see that they will know. 22:10 Tikiri Wickramasingha: Should I be adding my experience with freelancer to the list of more than 800 on https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/www.freelancer.com?rating=1 22:10 Tikiri Wickramasingha: and many other sites 22:10 Tikiri Wickramasingha: except I will do so including an extreme amount of detail about the experience 22:11 Tikiri Wickramasingha: SO far Freelancer has been a nightmare for me. 22:11 Tikiri Wickramasingha: This chat is perhaps the best experience so far and it is far from ideal 22:11 Tikiri Wickramasingha: because at the end of the day it is clear to you that I signed up with freelancer specifically for that program 22:12 Tikiri Wickramasingha: However you would rather go through a whole bunch of unnecessary and ridiculous processes to defer and whatever 22:12 Lorraine A.: i am trying to help you the best possible way I can. 22:12 Tikiri Wickramasingha: I know Lorraine 22:12 Tikiri Wickramasingha: the issue is not with you Lorraine 22:12 Tikiri Wickramasingha: you have done everything you can within what you are allowed to do 22:13 Lorraine A.: I understand that this is frustrating, however, issue has already been escalated. 22:13 Tikiri Wickramasingha: Freelancer.Com executive management are a bunch of con artists / scams / thieves / and scoundrels exactly as the reviews say 22:13 Tikiri Wickramasingha: Many thanks for doing your best Lorraine 22:14 Lorraine A.: You have my word, we will contact you once we verify your claim about the referral code. 22:14 Tikiri Wickramasingha: Please try and find yourself another job. This company freelancer.com is not worth people like you 22:14 Tikiri Wickramasingha: I wish you all the best 22:15 Tikiri Wickramasingha: and hope you have a most amazing weekend 22:15 Lorraine A.: Would that be all for today? 22:15 Tikiri Wickramasingha: One more thing: please let your team manager / senior manager / whatever the management structure is 22:16 Tikiri Wickramasingha: Please let them know that until they fix this and send me a written apology for the runaround I will keep using Upwork and will not bother with Freelancer.Com 22:17 Tikiri Wickramasingha: I have wasted over 5 hours of my time running around this issue 22:17 Tikiri Wickramasingha: My hourly rate is 110 NZD per hour 22:17 Tikiri Wickramasingha: AS you can see hassle just aint worth it for me 22:18 Lorraine A.: My apologies for the inconvenience. 22:18 Tikiri Wickramasingha: You have a most amazing weekend Lorraine.

350,"I went on this website to start my work as a freelancer working on spreadsheets. They are AWFUL. I went on and didn't have many leads, which is fine. When I finally got some work, they took out a huge portion - again, that's fine. I continued my membership, which was the cheapest one, but when I put in my credit card information, they upgraded me without my permission. It was a pain in the ass to get back my money. Later, I put in a bid to do some work for someone. It was valued at about 200USD. I was given the bid on accident and then denied. Freelancer took their cut anyway, even though there was no cut to be had, since i never got the money from the project. I complained for at least a month, then finally got my SOME of my money back.  I ended up with a balance of +60, when it should have been +300. At that point, I was so frustrated I just decided to clear my account and cancel my membership. I COULDN'T EVEN PULL OUT MY OWN MONEY!!! They said it was tied up because I was still locked into a bid. I told them to cancel the bid and just give me my money. They wouldn't do it.... eventually I just gave up and told them to keep the money, and just cancel my account. DO NOT GO WITH THEM. If I can save one person from signing up, I think my experience will have been worth something.",1,freelancer.com

352,Freelancer is just another web site (supposed) to put freelancers/employees in contact with employers. But lately freelancer has become a money grab. But the biggest problem is their 'Qualified' and 'Preferred' and other ratings/gimmicks. Seems to me that freelancer now employs people and use them as 'pseudo freelancers' - in other words they show EVERY sign of being a business that sub-contracts people in THEIR EMPLOY (scamming?) of various skills than a simple labour exchange that makes 'a buck' (3%+) on the side. Freelancer has got the last bit of money from me and I wait for the day they go 'belly up' very soon! Not to mention the project quality really sucks and looks like most projects are BOGUS! The Australian government should investigate them as I have serious doubts about Australia and the economy too (I still wonder how they were able to become a public company)!,1,freelancer.com
353,"I went on to Freelancer.com in order to have an artist design our company logo. I decided to run a contest in order to draw the best talent. I chose a budget, but by the time I finished with all of the ""extras"" I had more than doubled my budget. Being new to the site I thought it would be worth the extra expense. By pressing the guarantee button, more of what they consider artist would pay attention to my post due to the fact that I promised to pay. I sent a few examples of what we were looking for. 80% of the entries were copyrighted items straight off the internet. One of the entries took one of the images that I presented as an example and submitted that same image right back as an entry! Don't get me wrong 20% of the artist did come up with creative ideas and I did chose a winner that I was very pleased with. However, even having all of the artist (which I paid extra for) sign a NDA, one posted their horrific entry on the internet for all to see. Seriously, they took the Heinz Ketchup logo and replaced the wording with my company name. I am not happy.  I contacted Freelancer.com to make them aware that one of their artist was not in keeping with the NDA agreement. After 24 hours of ""research"" I received a reply from Freelancer.com that stated that it was my problem and that if I wanted to do something about it I was on my own. They advised me to contact an attorney. I was shocked that they wouldn't even agree to contact the artist to discipline them, warn them or prohibit them from further participation on the site. Most of the artist on Freelancer.com are doodlers without a creative bone in their body. They just search the internet for existing art and pass it off as their own. Which is against the rules of course but since no one is policing the site to protect the business owners, you know, the ones who are actually paying to keep the site alive by spending their hard earned money, then I do not see this getting any better. With the guarantee the artists know no matter what they present they will get paid.  I will not use this site again for new projects. However, I will be contacting the artist that won my contest directly, as he is a true artist. BE LEARY OF THE 80%, AND KNOW THAT FREELANCER.COM WILL IS NOT ON YOUR SIDE AND DOES NOT HONER AND UPHOLD THEIR OWN RULES.",1,freelancer.com
354,"Dear colleagues,  Never ever start having a deal with this establishment. The mechanism they steal your money is quite simple: 1) you place your bid 2) you are awarded 3) in a couple of minutes your project is marked as ""Incomplete"" and you are to pay 10% of its cost (which you have never received). You have neither rights nor place to appeal.  I am sorry for those people who had money on their accounts when these ""incompleteness"" happened. All their savings were simply stolen. I was lucky enough to have 50 cents at the moment. Thus, I congratulated the fraudsters with the huge loot ;) Nevertheless, the time I had spent to build my profile was gone for nothing.",1,freelancer.com
355,"Freelancer has STOLEN funds from me, making multiple significant ($100+) charges to my account despite having not authorization or cause to do so.  After having to dig through their site for nearly a day to find how to ""request a refund"" it took 17 interactions, 5 extremely clear demands and two whole weeks to refund the money... MINUS A DAMN TRANSACTION FEE! On top of that, every single entry I received for jobs I posted were blatantly plagiarized from google images. I even had one guy from India literally copy my job posting, word for word, post it as his own for a lower price, in an attempt to make money for himself. He intended on making someone else do the work for my logo job, and sell it to mew for more money! Freelancer apparently believes this is ok, as even after reporting it they've never responded.  Multiple other people I have contacted who've used this site have have had the same issues. My wife and her business partner used the site at roughly the same time as I, and had multiple erroneous charges appear on their account, and have yet to be able to get their money back.",1,freelancer.com

359,"I left the following review of Freelancer's support team after they failed to address my issues. READ THIS AND LEARN SOMETHING FOR ONCE: This ""support"" ticket was filed because a contest holder assigned a random 2.5 stars to my entry following the contest handover. He told me he did it just to release the money and didn't actually look at my work. I presented undeniable proof of this in the form of pictures to Freelancer ""Support"" and asked to have the rating removed since it lowered my overall score and hurt my chances of finding future work. They didn't. Kept saying ""we strive to uphold the integrity of the review system."" They needed the contest holder's permission but he never replied to my messages. I kept at it for days and still nothing. Freelancer sent him messages but he didn't reply to them either. I asked if I could change his score and was told ""If it's from negative to positive, yes. But if not, we also need a confirmation.""  So to change my score I need HIS confirmation. And to change his score I need HIS confirmation. I asked if I could lodge a dispute and was told: ""A contest dispute can only be lodged by the contest holder.""   So basically, the employer has ALL the power, and the freelancer has none. That's how Freelancer treats its own people. A few weeks before that I was ripped off by a con-artist who took my work and ran without paying me. His profile was an exact copy of someone else on Freelancer but he was still payment, profile and email verified. I didn't get my money because YOUR verification systems failed. These and many prior experiences have made something very clear: Freelancer throws 100% of its support behind the employers and none behind its freelancers. And I'm NOT the only one who feels this way. Just Google ""Freelancer.com reviews"" and you'll see the scathing rebukes and horror stories.  It's not a good sign when the word SCAM is repeated throughout. And as for the reviews that say Best site ever or Dream come true. Seriously, who are you fooling?  Keep this up and eventually your social media black-eye will turn away both clients and freelancers. It's already done that to me. Since my bad experiences, I've been using Freelancer less and less and eventually plan on stopping altogether and opening up accounts with Upwork or Guru. So to sum up: thanks for nothing. All I asked was to have ONE bad review removed and presented incontrovertible proof as to why. But I received nothing but excuses. Every time I turn to you guys I feel cheated on top of being deceived.  Your support staff is slow, ineffective, hugely incompetent, and reply with generic talking points. I'm giving this survey 1 star to voice my dissatisfaction at your massive ineptitude, and I'm sure I won't be the only one. As for the 1 star out of 7 that I gave. To quote one of your own talking points: ""We apologize but we strive to uphold the integrity of the review system.""",1,freelancer.com

Freelancer also penalizes YOU because of your employer not verifying their identity ... like what? How does that make sense? What are we supposed to do - force them to verify their identity? Pretty sure that's up to them whether they wish to put their personal info on a fraudulent website. I've lost HUNDREDS of dollars on this website due to the horrible way they do business. I do not recommend and glad I found an alternative!,1,freelancer.com

The developer company kept promising me delivery which never happened (not even single line of code) and Freelancer didn't do anything about it - only assured me that I need to dispute and case will go in my favor. Finally I disputed and Freelancer took 7 days to give it in my favor. After that I waited for money to show up in my account but now Freelancer had new process that I need to raise WithDrawl request which I finally did and then again waited.

The problem is, when you submit a support ticket (because their is no phone number for you to actually call them), the autoreply email states you will get a response within 24 hours.

That you keep 196 CAD of my money after i advised you that i had made a mistake transferring my funds to your illegal site, not acknowledging my email and hiding behind ""illegal non-refundable conversion rate"" its illegal and completely unethical and of bad judgement.

You kept it and you are hiding behind an ""illegal not refundable conversion rate"". Please accept all of my money you stole! And i will actively publicise your site so no one else, or even one person does not get trapped in this ""illegal non-refundable conversion rate"" site. I hope i will spend triple what you kept and I will never lie and hide like you did. I hope you still get along with Paypal when I send them this correspondence to prove to them you are "" illegal and completely unethical and of bad judgement"" i know its the last thing they want to deal with sites like you! I know you reacted only because i complained to Paypal not once but twice you proved it! And i know you would of kept all the money if I would not of used Paypal. Its just the kind of people you are!

The fees are enormous for small projects. For example if you take a 15$ project they will receive 5$ fee from the freelancer that took that project and 3$ from the employer + that tax that they take when you add money to their platform. And they have tons of fake projects that bots post. As an employer you will find in 90% of the cases indians that are very aggressive and copy paste the same offer for every project.

402,"The short version is that: a) freelancer has an unfair fee system b) freelancer keeps fees even if you try to close the project a minute after you award it (mistakenly or otherwise) c) freelancer does not provide real support during disputes unless you pay extra fees on top of the project fees they already collected i am a client (not provider) and decided to try freelancer.com after spending countless thousands with elance/upwork. well, that was my first mistake.  when i posted my first job i noticed that providers start to write proposals within seconds, and within minutes you will have the maximum 50+ bids on your project. i chose a provider that asked for a very small sum and had great feedback. that was mistake #2. his communication was not very good and i opted to cancel the project without any prejudice. i couldn't figure out how to 'close' the project and refund fees like i would on upwork. whatever i did ended up closing the project but left the provider with 10% fees from a project that never even started. i didn't know that and apologized and discussed it with him. provider stated that freelancer.co has screwed him out of 580 USD through their indisputable fee system and discriminate policies.  my second project was with a provider who looked good but she began nitpicking about how the money is to be released. i disagreed with what she wanted and opted to close that project too. and once again i couldn't so i tried to end it the way i did the first project but the provider had put a lock on the milestone and i could not. so i 'disputed' the milestones and opened an official claim thinking that freelancer.com would be there to assist us in an obvious miscommunication and offer the one solution that everyone wanted -- no fees, project closed, everyone happy. That was my third mistake. Freelancer.com couldn't give a $hi+ less about either one of our needs.  Freelancer.com repeatedly told me to 'work things out' with the provider and I wasted time writing numerous emails to them and their useless customer service team. I asked to escalate to a supervisor so that I can get a decision maker to simply refund the provider her 10% as a one-time courtesy but instead they repeated over and over that they don't give a $hi+ and it's our duty to work things out. They offered a paid 'arbitration' service where they will 'review' the dispute and make a decision (winner keeps his arbitration fee). The project never started, no work was completed, nothing was exchanged except some heated chats and emails and the result was nothing outside of freelancer.com taking a 10% commission through a fully automated system and a bit of 'support' from their customer service team that is likely in a third-world country office. Sorry, but that is what major companies do -- exploit poor nations to 'stimulate their economies' while paying a few hundred dollars a month to a full time overworked slave. THAT IS WHY YOU SHOULD NOT USE FREELANCER.COM AND OPT TO USING GURU, UPWORK, ODESK OR OTHER SITES. On their site they state their objective as 'providing a platform to connect people' and the rest is up to those people. In other words, no matter what the situation, once people agree to a project, freelancer.com take a fee and cite that they have a no-refund policy in case of issues.  Where did they come up with a system that takes 10% for no reason? If my project was 10,000 USD then they would have taken 1000 USD for NOTHING and in case of a dispute they would have asked for additional payment to 'arbitrate' on top of that 1000.

I was very unhappy with my freelancer and decided to go to another site as I had great experience there. I used upwork.com and 99designs. Should have stuck to them and not tried Freelancer.com. I had to fight the person I hired to get my money back as for some reason they have power to hold your money hostage. After a lot of back and forth and filing a dispute I had to pay $50 USD to get the rest of my money back. Just a terrible customer experience.

423,After waiting for a long time to give back to my normal account to get help from freelancer. Freelancer without seeing anything they directly put negative in my account. My account balance is -$2206 USD :( One of my client which I was working his project via Freelancer. Client checked his bank account and found so many membership charges from freelancer so He put reversal action which membership charge applied. But unfortunately Freelancer put my account in Negative. Where I have completed all project also done by client. So there was no any reason to put my account in negative.  I have asked many times to Freelancer to put my account back to normal But every time they says that they are contact to client. But that is no any reason to put my account in negative. Where I have very small business and grow up slowly slowly where this problem stopped my grow business. This was happened on 24-Sep-2015 and yet to solve :( I have very good review and rating in my freelancer account where i was getting more projects but after all stopped :( I think this Freelancer support are pathetic.

426,"During my time on freelancer.com, I only participated in contests.  These contests were absolutely horrifying. Nearly every user who entered had (1) completely ignored the guidelines set by the contest host, or (2) essentially copied the top-rated designs and then spammed the entry. Then they create fake accounts to ""like"" their own images & make them more visible. But by far, the worst offense was that a ridiculous amount of users just stole images and logos from other sites, and did so without consequence. I actually had a contest where I was the first to enter, I corresponded with the host to improve my design, and I spent upwards of 8 hours making something they would like. But when my design became the ""top pick"", a good 10 or 15 designers went and copied the image almost exactly. Even so, I thought I was fine because I was still rated the top design by the time the contest closed. And then another designer, who was clearly using images stolen from google & photoshopped (mind you, the guidelines stated it was to be an ""illustration""), was awarded the prize at the last minute. This was not Freelancer.com's fault, it was the host's decision. Regardless, that was the last straw for me. I'm not about to spend hours on an original design just to have the winner be someone who slapped together an image in 5 minutes, especially if they just essentially copied my entry. And I'm certainly not going to continue making designs for employers who couldn't care less about anything other than the end result, even if it's created illegally. If thousands of users on a website consistently violate copyright law without consequence, why would I feel like my work was safe from suffering the same fate? From what I've been reading, I'm at least thankful that I never gave them access to my bank account.",1,freelancer.com

We were working for some for some people from India, we have created for them many functionalities like login, register, payments, redesign... And we had a lot of harassment from their end. They refused to pay in the end because we didn't want to do additional staff for free (which weren't part of the project for which we bided). So we field a dispute hoping that their dispute team would solve this for us. After we have delivered all the evidence that we have created what was asked in project and documented for them, other party (employer) only provided few comments like evidence which were like, font was bigger than it supposed to be, or margin was a bit bigger here... None of the real evidence was delivered that some of the functionalities weren't working or that code was bad... In the end we were accused for communicating with employer on skype and they ended dispute in favor for employer. Freelancer team said it was evident that their work was not approved by the buyer as the final output. Isnt it obvious that if they stick to original posted project we wouldnt have a problem? And that we wouldnt file a dispute? If they have tested site and code, like they should when they have this kind of situations, they could see what was going on. This very much points to their unprofessional behavior and that someone who was doing it wasnt paying too much of attention while doing it. We were left with 47$ USD, which were released for first milestone. And for other two milestones for which we field a dispute freelancer said that we should get 0.00$. We were left with nothing for our work, freelancer took their cut from the dispute and from the full price that we should have received, and employer walks away with money and project.

434,"The support on this site is f***ing terrible. Automated response after automated response. Here's my story. Over two months ago I signed up to use this site as a freelancer, I've made decent clients and a decent amount of money...but they won't give me that money. I put in for my first withdrawal, for this they have a 15 day waiting period for new freelancers, I get that, whatever, I waited. All of a sudden 15 days later, without reason, that transaction fails. Next I put in another withdrawal, still being patient. 15 days goes by, I'm looking in my account, nothing. Then I'm told I have to wait another 12 days for the withdrawal. If you're keeping count we're at 42 days of waiting to withdrawal a small amount of money. All the while I'm trying to explain this to support, asking politely what I can do to expedite the process, receiving these BS copy/ paste responses. Which brings us to this week, when suddenly on the day my withdrawal was supposed to come through I receive an email telling me that they've chosen to ""limit"" my account and I'm unable to make withdrawals. At that point I'm p*ssed, but they still have my money so I do what they say and send a scanned copy of my license, a scanned copy of proof of residency, a photograph of myself holding my ID. Then apparently they are trying to get in touch with my clients to see if I'm a real person. So my clients are getting these messages claiming the person they're working with may be, what, some kind of fake account? Tarnishing my reputation with the people paying me. Wish I had read some of these reviews before signing up. Keep in mind I pay the subscription and they've made commission off every one of my projects. Leaving this review up unless all this bullsh*t gets resolved. UPDATE: This whole process is making it obvious to my clients that this site is a scam and they aren't willing to put up additional personal information to get ""verified"" on the site, so it looks like this bullsh*t site is keeping all of my earnings for the last TWO MONTHS. Can't get in touch with them in any capacity other than the threatening messages they keep sending saying that if my clients don't complete this process soon they're keeping all the money in my account. Update II: So now that my clients aren't willing to comply, Freelancer has taken the money out of my account, punishing me THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS COMPLIED and refunded my clients for the work I've done. Here's the catch - their accounts on the site are frozen too so that money is trapped in there. Now if they want to get that money back to me, they can't because they can't withdraw from their accounts. All the while the site is refusing to even get in contact with me anymore.

I reported a stolen vector and there seemed to be no punishment for stealing from others as the user did another submission right afterwards. I work hard to create my designs from a blank page so I don't appreciate the copying. So if you like to have stolen images from google in your projects or to have people steal your design ideas then this is the site for you.

445,"I've been using freelancer for 5 months now, and have had a few minor difficulties along the way. The last one, however, was a doozy. After running a project through, my bank account was riddled with additional (unexplained) charges from Freelancer, coming from Switzerland, so my bank stopped future payments to them.  After trying to make a legitimate charge, my bank denied the charge due to the suspicious activity mentioned above. After calling my bank to approve the legitimate charge, they cautioned me to be careful and DO NOT GIVE THEM ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION. I was able to deposit money into my Freelancer account after that, but when I tried to release the money to an artist, I was informed I couldn't release the money because of a security reasons. The solution (after getting a robot email response from customer 'service' was that I needed to give them my telephone number to verify that the money they had put into my account was secure - even though I've spent $2000+ on 8 different projects already). They wanted my phone number, even though a financial institution told me not to give them any personal information. I told Freelancer I couldn't give them my phone number and their response? Nothing. They email that it is for security reasons, but the response is the exact same wording with no clarifications. I've tried to chat online, never gotten an agent to actually chat, I've sent multiple emails and gotten the same respnse without explanation, and (here's the ironic part) haven't been given a phone number to call them about this. Now I have an artist who has delivered her work, I have funds that Freelancer is holding, and they won't let me release them to the artist or return them to me until I give them information my bank told me not to give them. One frustrating thing is that if you do open a ticket, they will respond with a cookie-cutter respond and then mark the issue as resolved....even though it hasn't even been addressed! Bottom line? It seemed like it had a few problems at first, but now they appear to be downright shady. The fact that banks and credit card companies flag their activity as suspicious should be a clue about the company's way of doing business. Upwork.com is light years ahead on service and security. UPDATE: Freelancer responded, saying they needed my phone number for security, so thank you for responding! Unfortunately, I'm still not sure how you having my phone number assures security or why it is asked for 6 months after joining the site and $2000+ later, or why their patterns of billing activity threw off suspicious activity alerts at both my credit card company and my bank.  I also still find it curious that they need my phone number for security reasons, but they refuse to give out their own phone number to customers...",1,freelancer.com

448,"Ok, my story is as follows. Back in December 2015 I commissioned a developer to build an app for me. The agreed price was £2700 but Freelancer added hidden charges for the international conversion from USD to GBP and passed them onto me. Disgusting act ONE. This ended up as a final total of around £2912. I disputed this with them and I should have realised what I was letting myself in for when robots (or that's how i can describe them) kept repeating the same line about this being my fault etc etc. In the end, they agreed in writing to waive this fee as long as I deposited another £2700 into my wallet and they would refund the original amount back to. Like I have £2700 lying around to give to this bunch of crooks! So fast forward 2 months and the app is built and the milestone payments released. I then decided enough was enough regarding the extra conversion charge Freelancer levied on me so I asked my bank to carry out a chargeback on the £212. The bank duly refunded me this money back.  Now, you would think this would be the end of it. NO, not with these thieves. Through their obscure terms and conditions they took wait for it...£2200 out of my developer's wallet blaming my chargeback action for it. Yes, they actually have done that!  The knock on effect of this has been horrendous. I can't get my app off my developer as he is £2200 out of pocket through Freelancer taking his money and I am £2700 out of pocket without an app to show for it. The winner: FREELANCER! who sit there nice and pretty with other peoples' money.  So, they then ask me to go through their ""verification centre"" where someone new comes on every 7 days to send one line of rubbish about cancelling the chargeback. This is when they have agreed to waive the charge in writing! If I don't do this, then they will not release my developer's money and therefore my app. Call it a virtual human shield if you like.. My bank are useless to the point where I can't even claim my money back through services not received as there is no ""proof"" from Freelancer's website on a date of receipt of my product.  This has dragged on and on for months to the point where I've given up hope of ever getting my money back or my app. I have had to lose the initial £212 chargeback by cancelling the investigation through my bank as I need my app. I have to take that on the chin.  Problem is Freelancer now making demands about me providing documents that the chargeback has been cancelled when all they have to do is check their bank statement! Honestly, the nature of these people is INHUMAN. You know what makes it worse? My app was aimed at helping disadvantaged children who are Dyslexic and Autistic but that doesn't matter to these bunch of crooks. They want their pound of flesh and few measly ill gotten dollars and they don't care if innocent children get caught in the crossfire. Collateral damage I believe they call it. I put all my savings into this project and unfortunately these children will never get to see this app which would have helped them and their families tremendously. When you have no mercy on innocent children then you really have lost all humanity. That is bad karma. It took me a year to save this money up only to lose it in an instant.. It doesn't help that my developer is a heartless b...ard who accuses ME of fraud. That hurts even more.  I would love to take these people to court if I could afford it but being in the UK and them being Aussies, I have little chance of success.  I will no doubt get the customary robotic ""customer service"" email on here for public show of course. Just to show the readers that they take this seriously when in fact they couldn't care less.  So that's my story and all in all, it's a living nightmare. I just wish I never used them in the first place. I implore any readers, please don't use these criminals. They will rob you blind. I have to somehow come to terms with losing over £3000 which took me over a year to save up, bit by bit.  All I have written is factual. If Freelancer want to dispute that, I am more than willing to show the public who is right and who is wrong. I have all the correspondence. Good luck people and wish me luck too :( UPDATE: Even after cancelling my chargeback to resolve this, these criminals demand letters which my bank simply cannot provide as it's not their policy. I will NOT stop posting reviews against you Freelancer till the day I die. You are thieves, that's all you are. Return Steven6's £2200 to him so I can get my app back.",1,freelancer.com

If you accept you find out the company does not exist, but Freelancer still exacts its $60 fee without a refund (unlike sites like Upwork which have built in protections against fraud).

455,I have earned a lot of money by working hard as a programmer. In 2013 a person hired me to work on http://www.cardsbus.com after completed my job he release the milestone and I have got the money. After some days freelancer deducted around $400 which he paid me for some tasks I have done. Just give me the reason client charge back. BUT WHY ?? No reason. When I have done the work then why freelancer refund employer's money. Well as I have got good experience so I bear the loss and started working again with new clients. Last year again I get a client who need work in urgent for first task he paid me 300euro even the task was 70% completed. So I started live chat with freelancer support that I am in doubt this employer is a scammer and please review his account/identity etc etc. The support guy checked the account and confirmed me no issue and money is yours and you can withdraw the amount. Well I was keep working for him hard. Within 10 days he give me a lot of work for day and nights and paid me around 1600euro. Including some design work so I have hired a designer in my office and get the work done. I have got the funds in my payoneer account and I have paid to designer but again same story after almost a month the client charge back and my account has gone into negative. I have worked on some other project almost $400 which freelancer deducted and remaining around -1220euro still in negative. BUT WHY CLIENT CAN CHARGE BACK IF HE GOT HIS WORK DONE ? WHY FREELANCER CAN'T GIVE PROOF TO HIS BANK ETC THAT HE PAID FOR THIS WORK OR WHY DON'T give any details to worker about the payment which employer used to scam ? My career was depends on freelancer.com as I was doing full time work on this plate form they have just given me free membership for few months but why I work again to cover the loss. Why I bear a big loss every year ? I have requested them on different plate forms to resolve the issue even on the CEO's twitter and their fan page etc etc. I am sure no one will respond me from freelancer.

456,"Freelancer.com seems to be a great idea but the way the system works might mislead people. The portal claims it is safe and offers money back guarantee, but is not true and the customer service really ignores people, they take several days to reply through a ticket base system, always with evasive answers that just protect their abusive policies, and the phone never answers. Freelancer allows the possibility to offer services all over the world, as well as customers to receive service outside their country boundaries, they just forgot to follow other countries laws and guidelines. Such company claims to be the market leader should not mislead and ignore customers this way, and I am pretty sure America is no longer accepting this kind of treatment anymore.",1,freelancer.com

465,"Hi! I'm Scammed by Freelancer for $4500 USD. I sent emails not less than 50 times for as long as 8 months and as always, I received auto-generated reply, stating that we'll get back to you within 48 hours and for Freelancer Team that 48 hours never come. Whenever I tweeted on https://twitter.com/freelancer/with_replies immediately I received an auto-generated reply ""Hello, Let us discuss the details of your concern through DM. Thanks."" Once I let them know the issue, they say we've forwarded your issue to the concerned department and they will do the needful. Again I waited for months expecting a reply, but never received on twitter nor to our tickets.  By fellow user, I learnt that there is an option for Live Chat. I tried contacting support team through Chat. The Support Executive name is Dave. S and he was very unprofessional, ethic-less, rude and *****.  After a long chat which went for more than an hour, he had no answers for me and he said ""I'm disconnecting the Chat"" without providing any solution for the payment of $4500, which is Locked in my Freelancer account.  As there was no option left for me, I tried to Contact CEO Matt Barrie regarding the issue. I never got any reply to my Tweets from him. When I sent few more tweets asking for help, he blocked me on Twitter page. This clearly shows that he is the main Culprit/ Fraud/ Criminal and encouraging his Fraud Team to scam more users from Worldwide.  This is the time, I received a tweet from another user ""xyx"" (Not Real Name) saying even that Gentleman was scammed for $2000 USD and Freelancer Team had even Threatened and Harassed him for 6 Months, he sent me all the supporting documents related to Scam/ Harassment done by Freelancer Team.

As usual I didn't get any help despite having Chat for more than 30 Minutes. At last I was very much disturbed and I said ""Don't give me auto-generated Bull$#*! replies"", immediately the Support Executive said, I abused him and Closed my Freelancer Account and Scammed me for $4500 USD.  After reading Reviews on this page, I sent email to all the Freelancer Team who has mentioned their email ids here. For reference: Lara (larao@freelancer.com) and few more. But never received any reply from anyone.  Simply when you post a review here, they ask you to send an email or they will create a Ticket for you, to which they never reply.

First project, the Freelancer does not complete the project and disappears off the face of the earth (to be fair, she didn't claim her money either!!) So, second time lucky? I post a second Project. The quality of the work was looking pretty poor and after the time period had elapsed to deliver the whole project and I hadn't even had the first part delivered, i was giving up hope. So what else could possibly go wrong? So, I am checking my bank statement as I regularly do, only to find that Freelancer.com had decided to dip their thieving grubby hands into my credit card, not once.....but twice! Whats worse is that they had failed to credit my Freelancer account with the funds - 5 DAYS after the smash and grab! I them spent 30 minutes trawling through their crappy website trying to find a customer service number and email address -(good luck with that by the way!) only to find that they have employed the CIA to ensure that none of their customers can ever find them. I eventually find a template which a can submit to a literal black hole in India somewhere and Lo and behold.......Yep you guessed it! No one came back to me. So, I called my Bank and disputed the two transactions. As soon as they had done than and quicker than you can say ""Thieving bunch of rats"" I receive a message on my Freelancer Profile telling me that My profile had been suspended until i informed them of why I dint think it was okay for them to debit money from my card without my permission! Also, I need to provide them with Passport and/or Drivers licence and Utility bill and/or bank statement (I was super comfortable with providing an already proven untrustworthy outfit with an identity scammers field day kit!). But here's the thing. I hire this guy in Mexico who is working his butt off to deliver what I have asked him to do and frankly I honour my agreements. So i cobble together some information that satisfied their needs. A promise that 48 hours after submission of these documents, my account would be  So I put money onto my account to pay him and waited 48 hours. Couldn't release. Wait 4 days. Still couldn't release. Now more than 5 days on. They are still 'reviewing' the documents i sent and not releasing the funds to the Freelancer. THEY HAVE OF COURSE DEDUCTED THEIR POUND OF FLESH - RIGHT!! SH*T REALLY does not get much worse than this!  These guys are either completely inept, completely corrupt or completely both. Whatever the conclusion (and I have a very clear idea of where I think they sit) I would steer the hell away from these cowboys. A great Idea and if it was being run out of London or Palo Alto then I would be 95% behind it. God only knows who runs this outfit; Where they run it from; What they do with your credit card details; What they do with your personal data........ We must all be F*cking crazy (myself included) to be using this site as we don't know the answer to any of the above questions!!!!! So, in order to make it look like they really do exist and function as a company, they employ a monkey to respond to the appalling reviews they are getting. My particular chimp sent me a message saying that they are holding on to MY money for MY protection!!! We Pal, I didn't have any issues through life......that is.....until I got involved wth your f*cking sh*t organisation. You are a bunch of crooks and need to be out of business! I have checked your verification centre and you are still verifying the same documents more that a week late Sh*twad so what the f*ck was the point of your comment you silly c*nt! And so it gets better. The pleading poverty criminal that I hired from the site was sending me daily communications about web development, telling me he needed to host the site on our domain. We of course refused as we didn't want an unauthorised site on our domain. So he changes approach. ""Okay, can I have access to your WordPress environment?"" Well sure you can........ ""My user id does not work"" Yes it does.... ""But I need access to to create a new database"" No, we will do that for you..... ""Okay, thanks"" Several days later, no website transfer, so we contact the guy and ask why...... ""Nothing is working on your hosting platform sir"" Oh really......so we check access logs and see exactly what he has been doing and go back to him ""But what I really need is access to your CPanel Admin"" No, you can't have it....... Several days later, still miss website, do we contact him again. ""Oh the site is finished and on your domain"" Oh really? Well we can't find it. Please send us a link....... Several days later.......still no link, so we contact him again...... ""We are having problems on your site so we have moved it back to our site.......here is the link"" The so called site was three pages so basic crap which was completely different and significantly worse than the previous rough drafts!! We immediately remove his access from our site and lock him out. He was clearly only after our CPanel admin password.

So this is the message i receive after winning a dispute from a client who did not want to pay. I don't understand what the use of their dispute system.  They did not protect their freelancers.

479,"Hi, Client had hired me for a project worth of $1100. Domain was part of the project and I purchased Domain from my money and completed the Project. Client was very happy with my work and gave me 5 Star rating with one the best Feedback. The next morning, when I logged in to Freelancer.com, I was literally shocked to see around -ve $1300. Then I contacted Support team to know whether the negative balance is showing by mistake and this is the support I got from Customer Support Team. 1. Support Team said Employer Violated Terms & Conditions, so the milestone was reversed. 2. Support Team agreed that Tier 2 Team was aware that project Violated Terms & Conditions 3. They never returned the project Fee of $55 4. They did Currency Conversion twice and scammed Close to another $100 USD. 5. When I demanded for the Payment, they disconnected chat and Limited my Account 6. After few hours they sent Apology email stating, that the Chat was Disconnected from Support Team purposely 7. Next time when I again Contacted Support Team, they Closed my account.

480,I am on site jabber.com and am reading one bad review after another about freelancer.com. I have tried getting work from that site for about a month and have seen my horrible experience over and over again on site jabber. Guess I should have looked here first! Especially since I am out $100. The worst part is that I received an email the other day asking me to vote for them to win an AWARD for being one of the BEST freelance sites out there. HOW is that POSSIBLE.,1,freelancer.com
481,"UPDATE: As everyone can see, Freelancer has replied to my review on this website. My support tickets, however, still go unanswered, although the rep apparently had the time to check the ticket number and confirm that it exists. My ticket was submitted on the 30th of April, so that is almost 2 weeks now that I've been waiting for a reply. What else do you need to know of a company, other than that their representatives give more importance to replying to bad reviews on other websites, than actually taking care of customer service on their own website? UPDATE 2: After updating my review and sending a private message to the rep asking for them to actually look at my ticket, I received a reply - only to my original query. The CS rep that replied to me completely ignored my second message (and problem), and just marked my ticket as completed. I had to manually open it again to be able to reply to her and aks her to read my other messages as well!  The word that comes to mind is ""underwhelmed"". Original review: I was awarded two projects on Freelancer.com during the same week - one for an hourly contract and one for a fixed-price contract. Having been burned by scammers previously, I was smart about my payments this time and had the client deposit the payment in as a milestone. I completed my work and sent the files to him, after which he gave me additional work. I was overjoyed! I created an invoice for the amount equal to the extra work and sent it to him, which he promptly paid. Much to both of our surprise, what happened is that the paid invoice absorbed the milestone into it, and only charged the client for the amount that went over what he had initially deposited. This made for a very uncomfortable moment when I had to ask the client to verify if this is what actually happened, and basically had to ask him to repay something we both had thought he had already put into escrow! On an hourly contract, things got even more bizarre. I was hired for a very short job, so the client deposited only an hour's worth of money to give me a sense of security. I did the work using the time tracker (which is now required), and after completing my work - which took 1 hour and 42 minutes - I received an immediate automated e-mail telling me how many hours I had worked so far that week and what they were worth. The e-mail stated showed an accurate amount and also told me that an invoice would be automatically generated and sent to the client on this and this day. Alright, cool. Much to my surprise, however, the automatically created invoice did not actually bill the client according to my real-time worked hours (like it said in the e-mail), it had billed him a flat hour - even though my actual working time was written on the invoice, just like an afterthought. ""Worked hours 1.42, billed hours 1."" Why? The client's already paid my invoice and left me stellar feedback, so asking him to pay the rest is another awkward situation I really wish I didn't have to be in. On top of this all, I sent an e-mail to support about this over a week ago, and the only thing I've received back is ""we will be in touch in 24 hours""! When you combine this with the fact that I keep getting invites to apply to jobs that specify a budget which is 1/3 of the rate written on my profile, the fact that Freelancer sends you tons of spam that clogs up your e-mail, and the fact that there is now a minimum charge for each project you are granted (which is charged immediately after you land the project, by the way - and thus forces you to require the client to release 10% of funds immediately just so your account doesn't go to minus from the project fee), making projects with a budget of under 50 dollars a complete waste of time when all things are considered, Freelancer has just become an absolute garbage website. I'm very disappointed.",1,freelancer.com

UPDATE: as you can see freelancer like to send public shows of ""customer service"" to keep up the facade that they care but in actuality, they take months to respond to concerns and even then it's still in the same arrogant and robotic manner. don't be duped.  if you still decide to post a project on freelancer after reading hundreds of negative reviews then you deserve to lose your money. i like many learnt the hard way and i have lost everything thanks to these £$%^. i wish i had done my homework but it's a very harsh lesson learnt.",1,freelancer.com

The freelancer I chose was asmarjamshaid who I now know was an agent with few translators. He assured me the job will be done within the time by a native Japanese. I woke up next morning to a project submitted. Woohoo. well that joy only lasted for a min, as I read the text only to realise the proofreading done by this person was worse than Google Translate.  I messaged him only to receive a reply insisting me that it was done by native. Regardless of whether it was completed by a native or not, the text was unusable. So I let him know of it, and submitted a negative review accordingly. He then sent me a number of threatening messages, including ""Go to hell"".  I disputed the payment via Paypal to get my money back as I did not believe this freelancer did not deserve it, and also, I had to get someone else, and pay for the someone else to get it done.

491,"After spending over $40 on English tests on Freelancer to boost my ratings I was invited to apply for a job which I didn't feel qualified for. The only way I could see on the Freelancer site to contact the client was to accept the job and ask her more questions, as she was adamant that she wanted to hire me despite the fact that the job was for a VA position in the UK which paid $600 - and I live in CA, USA. Imagine my shock when $60 was immediately deducted from my PayPal account. When I contacted PayPal to dispute the charge, my Freelancer account was ""limited for security reasons"". Despite repeated emails over the past 10 days, I am still waiting for a refund. Trying to chat with the help desk just sends me back to the page telling me my account is limited. Per Freelancer instructions I cancelled the dispute with PayPal in order to get my money back. I did that. Still no response. So, between taking the tests and the $60 fee I am $100 out of pocket - which isn't as much as some Freelancers have lost - but it's a lot of money to me! Wish I'd checked out the reviews before I decided to use Freelancer. I worked on Elance for years without any problems whatsoever. I wish they were still around. I forgot to mention that I declined the job but Freelancer still took their fee. For NOTHING! UPDATE - on 4/6 I received a credit to PayPal for the full amount. I was thrilled, and ready to change the rating I'd given Freelancer. However, today Freelancer has charged my PayPal account $10.48. I have NO idea what this is for as I only intended to use the Free membership on Freelancer. It seems that once this company has your PayPal details they just help themselves. I will be disputing the payment. I feel that Freelancer is just too eager to take money for nothing - and I sympathize with those of you who've lost a lot of money by using the site. I have contacted PayPal who have blocked this company from taking any more money from my account, and who have refunded the $10.48 fee which I did NOT approve as a recurring payment.

I have already verified my account via SMS (which does not seem to suffice for them, even as that is listed as one possible manner in which to verify your account).

497,"In the term of one month I completed 5 projects, putting in 140 hours and actually getting paid (in theory) for one of those jobs. Because of Freelancer's fee system, I actually lost several hundred dollars, charged to my credit card, in addition to 140 hours of free work. Here is how it works: 1) A fraudulent employer, with no intention of ever paying posts a job. 2) That fraudulent employer hires one or more people to complete his project. 3) Freelancer charges you credit card based on the total price. 4) You complete the work, talk to the employer on a daily basis, and they give you lots of positive feedback that they love what you are doing. 5) You hit a Milestone, and the fraudulent employer tells you ""why don't we just finish this and I'll release the total amount"". 6) You complete the assignment. 7) The fraudulent employer disappears, no more conversations. 8) You file a dispute, which Freelancer ignores for as many as 10 days (that's my experience so far), I don't expect they will ever respond. 9) Freelancer claims no economic responsibility and still charges you based on the size of the fraudulent assignment. 10) Freelancer continues to ignore all of the fraud taking place, as long as they get their fees (which they pull from your credit card whether or not you ever get paid). Bottom line is I feel entirely foolish for having logged onto this site. PLEASE DO NOT follow my mistake. It may seem appealing, work from home, work on your own schedule, do things that your good at, but it's all a giant fraud. I am in the process of suing Freelancer, my attorney has requested their information, which is not available anywhere on the site (try to find an address, phone number or even their country, which is Australia). My lawyer has suggested that they are like to not give us this information, which means we will need to seek a summons through the Australian justice system. If anyone out there want's to join a class action suit, I am prepared to fund it's start, and my attorney is prepared to process it. So, this is not a ""OK"" for this site this is a ""THIS SITE SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN"". Anyone interested in joining a class action (it costs you nothing) should contact me at: christopher.peznola@gmail.com I will forward your information to the attorney, he may contact you for a brief interview, but again, you have nothing to lose, and hopefully we can close these f%^&ers down.

Having a great experience with upwork (oDesk) i needed to widen my project range, so i came across the 'number one platform for freelancers'. After signing up i was told that im best having some qualification behind me by doing a exam. After doing them on odesk for free, i was surprised to see they were charging for them, but that didn't bother me, i did a test and passed and got my badge. I tried another one but didn't pass, to resit the test they wanted another $8, so i forgot about it.  After applying to jobs with the ferocious competition, i finally got offered a job which i gladly took. Getting ready to pay my rent for the week, i was shocked when my bank told me i didn't have enough funds in my account. I checked to find that freelancer had directly removed the fee for the job from my account, when i hadn't even started working on it. I contacted support to find out that they take the fee from the freelancer directly instead of from the funds that they had already acquired from the employer. This is probably so they always get their cut If the payment is unauthorized (take from the little guy, trust). This was something i had never experienced from a freelancing website, but i was shocked when i read the support email where the member has said ""This is not refundable if the project isn't successful"" (yeah, typical). I still kept using the site in order to get the money i could from this job (didn't have a choice now). After completing, the employer released the funds which i went to withdraw. The first thing i noticed is that they had their own exchange rates. (Losing $13 from the current exchange rate) And they are also making me wait half a month before they even consider releasing my funds because of ""security reasons"". Talk about a disaster.

I wish i did product review search before I used them. Im $921 out of pocket for nothing in return. Their support is the worst in the world. No telephone support like other companies and terrible email support and response times. Here is my story. I hired a contractor to do some website work after paying one of freelancers staff a fee of $32 fee to recommend the best freelancer for the job. I interviewed the contractor they recommended, I awarded the job to him and we agreed on a timeframe to complete the work. I then paid $800 for the job plus other admin fees $27 & $18 to Freelancer . Once I had paid freelancer the funds, the contractor then said he was going on holidays and would not be free much to do the work. We clearly discussed the time frame and he assured me he was available to complete the job. But then as soon as the job was awarded and moneys transfer to Freelancer the contractor told me he is now not available much to do the work. I needed to get the job done and decided to get somebody else to do the work from a different agency. The contractor demanded he gets paid $100. Basically for just the job interview. No work had started or documents were provided to the contractor. I told him its ridiculous you wanted to get paid for briefly discussing the job over skype, but he demanded to get paid $100 for the job interview. I contacted Freelancer support and they told me there was an arbitration process that had to be followed. So I did that and paid another $42. The contractor backed down and I was won the dispute. They still will not release my money back to me even though i clearly won and no work has even started. Freelancer has now frozen my funds and mentioned in the notes that this matter will be resolved in 64 days. 64 days my friends, can you believe it 64 days.(Note I can still deposit more money though) They has asked me to supply my passport , rates notices and other proof of id. I thought this was ridiculous but as this was not need in the beginning but did as they requested. Absolutely made no difference. Their poor support has disappeared. This drama has been going on for 3months now. Im $921 out of pocket. I can not get a refund or use the money to get any work done. Its not worth it to ever use this company.

Make sure you use a credit card so you can call your bank to get your full money back because it will be almost impossible to get your money back from them. Make sure you read the fees and charges policy because you will be charge for just about anything you do in the website, for real..... https://www.freelancer.com/feesandcharges/ For a $650 project I posted, I had to pay almost $70 in fees for posting a job....

513,"I started using Freelancer 3 weeks ago and have posted (as employer) 3 well paid jobs on there. I made 3 payments to my freelancers and then Freelancer froze my account following a cancelled Milestone Payment agreed between me and one of the freelancers (as it would have been an over-payment). I have written endless messages to Freelancer submitted many tickets asking them to resolve my account. It has not been resolved. The site says I have to verify my account - I have the photo with my passport, utility bill etc - but I cannot submit them as my account is limited - what a nightmare!!  This is one week ago and since then I have had 2 freelancers complete work who I have not been able to pay via Freelancer due to my account being limited. This makes me look very unprofessional and so I have been forced to pay them directly via Paypal (I had no choice or I would lose them for my next work (now on Upwork btw). Absolutely appalling customer service, no phone number to call, no assistance - just left hanging in a mess with my freelancers. DO NOT USE THIS SITE!!",1,freelancer.com

517,"I was a member of freelancer.com since 2010 .. and i have earned a great reputation there .. was having approx 298 reviews with 5 stars and was having approx 1700 usd when they closed my profile for no reason , i have complete proof of all and all tickets etc generated let me attach and proof here ... this was my profile link  www.freelancer.com/u/alinawaz88.html here is the screenshot of my profile i took in 2014 (few months before it was closed)  ==> http://screencast.com/t/dkbGgrA2AGYk here is the complete CASE i forward to freelancer I have been a member of freelancer.com since 2010 with approx 298, 5 star reviews and a valuable assest to freelancer. Due to some misunderstanding (and issues created by a client), my account was closed without any explanation asked from me. I still have no clue as to what client told freelancer team and why I was not contacted before taking such extreme measures. You can ask my other clients for my work ethics and behaviour as well as quality of work or I can gladly request them to provide testimonials from me, if my past reputation is not enough. I would request freelancer to be considerate and reinstate my account please. If any terms are breached, I would gladly like to know and rectify and avoid in future so it doesn't happen again. I think everyone deserves a second chance please. At least if you can tell me, I assure you any such thing would not happen ever again. This is my humble request to freelancer and your consideration will be greatly appreciated. I would also like to mention few noteworthy points: 1) I was never given a chance for explanation and whatever client told freelancer it was believed immediately. The only explanation I got was ""substantial proof"" of threatening client. To account for this, I provided the proof of his conversation (which i am attaching again). This evidence clearly shows how cunning this person is that he first threatened me and then approx 20 min later deleted his own conversation to remove any traces. Lord knows what else he manipulated to provide as a proof to freelancer which I am unaware of and freelancer believed him. While I was sending proof, freelancer had already closed my account. I understand behaviours are not tolerated, then how can this (attachement) was tolerated and why I was the victim of this? 2) I had also attached backup of the work done [#NJN-767-10444]. If I had taken the site down, why would I be willing to share and restore the site? Also, considering how this client mind is, he would be very well aware that a site can be easily restored by resetting the server/hosting to its previous state. 3) I agreed to proposed solution byfreelancer.com [#NJN-767-10444] i.e. to restore the site as well as stop from communicating with client, yet my account was closed half hour later. Could you please explain this? I was willing to resolve this matter. Also, he had changed his cpanel access, ftp logins so I couldn't access the backend. 4) I have been on freelancer for a long time now with high reputation and I know the rules. If by any chance I have unintentionally breached the terms, please forgive and point out so that I can rectify my mistake and avoid it in the future. I am a human after all and deserve a 2nd chance. 5) You can check my past history and see for yourself that I provide quality, yet professional work. I even showed them the proof where client used foul language , still i didnt said anything , => http://screencast.com/t/HZ2aiYxTqqw Now if freelancer is REAL and not SCAMMING people , REPLY TO my post and open my case !! You guys will not as u are SCAM !! i will wait for the reply from FREELANCER.COM it is over 3 weeks now no reply from FREELANCER.COM .. THEY ARE FOR SURE A SCAM .

521,"Our company has used outsourcing systems for nearly 15 years now. Freelancer appears polished and cutting edge on the surface, but what stirs below is unacceptable. We went through a number of highly rated India developers, who in turn trashed our CMS system. We have since hired professional and skilled developers outside of Freelancer who are not false in describing their skillsets. Sadly, many of the developers on Freelance promise great results, but are less than acceptable. Freelancer attracts the undersided dark realm of developers, many who are dishonest, who claim templates and other projects as their own, who inflate their time on per hour projects excessively. India and Pakistan for example, is rife with these type of developers. Developers will often start with energy, but if the project become complicated, they lay it aside for easier projects won, and weeks later you find yourself listing in the sea of no progress. India developers for one will back away from a project whose manager knows that time is being padded and refuses to accept time extortion and poor results. Freelancer has no effective means of accountability, where project abuse is frequent and not policed properly.  Additionally, the system is setup as such as a person is extorted to leave a good review to remain a valid user of the system, where a developers rating often should have been one star. We learned the hard way to not add a credit card or Paypal account for Freelancer access. The process provides no confirmation window during the acceptance of a candidate, where suddenly you find a large fee has been deducted from your funding source as payment for all the milestones, held in the Freelance system without reprieve. Paypal assisted me by reversing the fees by force reversal due to my long history with them and due to the poor reputation of Freelancer, but Freelancer stated it would not reverse the unapproved deduction from my Paypal account. However later Freelancer claimed they kindly refunded my funding, but they actually did nothing but refused to assist. Flee from Freelancer, at great speed to preserve your funds and sanity.",1,freelancer.com
522,"Hello, I'd like to get started by sharing my story and how no one in freelancer takes any responsibility for what goes on with employees. I had a website that needed to be fixed and a freelancer by the name Technospike (DO NOT HIRE) was supposed to fix my page and other tasks that were included in a word document.  Once the freelancer accepted, after 10 minutes she sent in a new milestone request asking for another $100 (Initial project was $100) without even doing ANYTHING. In the document sent it was clearly stated what needed to be completed and no money until completion.  She accepted the job and advised 3 Days, almost 2 weeks later she broke my website, broke all formatting and still was asking for MONEY even though she screwed up big time, so I asked to kindly fix and then she tried to trick me into removing the project so she would not get a bad review then she would release the money. Now I am in a situation where SUPPORT is simply ridiculous. They only provide chat support which is very funny for the amounts of money they handle and the more I find out and read I am starting to think that they even set up fake profiles to trick people into paying.  At this moment I don't think I will recover the money at all as they tell me that only the freelancer can release the funds (VERY STUPID DECISION) since I could create fake profiles and start tricking people into it.  If you love your company and time, PLEASE AVOID THIS SCAM. If it is to good to be true it probably isn't. If I receive my money back I will update, also let's not forget that I GOT CHARGED 5 DOLLARS TO CREATE THE PROJECT AND REMOVE IT BUT YET AGAIN THEY ARE GOOD TO RECEIVE THE MONEY BUT NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS AND SUPPORT.  COMPANIES LIKE THIS NEED TO DISAPPEAR, SIMPLY DISGUSTING AND TIME CONSUMING. UPDATE: Hello everyone,  I wanted to update my review as things are getting more complicated with this company and It seems that I will never get my money back. I have reached out to their support department more than 5 times now and it has been over a month and still no responses.

The Freelancer creators have found an absolutely amazing way to scam people out of their money. Well done! I can just see them now, sitting on their butts, coming up with ways, not to enhance the community, but to take peoples money. I bet they even thought of ways to make you pay just to read their site but reconsidered on the chance we may not go for that. Maybe theyll rethink it and introduce it somewhere down the line. I created a dispute and still waiting for my money. I created two milestones but changed my mind and yep, still waiting for my money. Oh, you want to take it to the next level? That will cost you money. I have come to grips with the realization that I wont get my money back. So, its ok. Go have a late on me.

I'm working on freelancer.com for more than 1 year, and completed more than 10 project there, with 100% positive ratings. Few days ago, Freelancer.com has blocked my funds, as a reason they gave me this: ""Funds originated from an account that is currently under review."". Its second time it happened to me, but this time is more annoying because lack of contact from Freelancer.com team. I wrote several messages to the helpdesk and did not receive ANY response, so they are blocking my money and don't want to clarify whole situation. No contact, no explanations and no money. Just nothing. THEY JUST DON'T REPLIED FOR MY MESSAGES. How silly is that? This site is simply a SCAM.",1,freelancer.com

540,"I have worked on this Freelancer.com for some years now. Before, it used to be a wonderful experience, but now, it seems the site has been hijacked by the scammers. You see a situation where people just turn on their computers, register an account on Freelancer.com and start posting projects indiscriminately, genuine or counterfeit. The unsuspecting users mostly the freshers are the major victims in this regard. Scammers make them bid for those fake projects, (which are being posted almost every 20 seconds) and make them to work without doing the milestone and run away after the worker has delivered the job. One can authoritatively say that the scenario is such that 7 out of every 10 jobs being posted are scams. I have written to the Customer Support on several occasions to report this ugly development; I even suggested to them that they should introduce a policy where users will be charged certain fee to post projects. I told them that this will go a long way to curtail the menace as it will help in chasing some of these obstreperous users away. But it seems that the Freelancer.com team never valued my suggestion. Now, the situation has gotten out of hand and I'm afraid, because this is not a good sign for the company; only if the management of the company realise the implication of this problem. If not, then we are all together sitting on a keg of gun-powder. Something needs to be done urgently, because the boat is seemingly sinking!",1,freelancer.com

547,"Freelancer just emptied the money from my account, just because the guy who gave me the project did not complete his verification. I am with freelancer for more than 7 years. I told them, it is his freewill I really can not interfere with other peoples freewill. What benefit he has to complete the verification process?  I completed my verification process by providing all my ids faithfully. But asking other people to submit their id is not really with in my control. If freelancer want this kind of verification to be done, then they have to make the verification to be completed before accepting money from the client.  I trusted Freelancer and I released my work to him. Where is the security for my work that was delivered to him? I am just small people working hard and making just small wages like few hundred dollars. And Freelancer is literally treating their members like as if they are part of a terrorist organization or something. There is a limit to police the activities on the website, this seems like too extreme. I did all the things they asked me to do and submitted every document they requested, regardless of that they want to reverse my hard earned money.  I would really recommend them to work for CIA or FBI , they are more suitable for that kind of job, they do not know how to care for the hard work their members did.  Why I am being the middle man between Freelancer and the guy who gave me the project to ask him submit their documents for the project that was completed and closed? I really pitty the people who have suffered similar fate like me.  I would really recommend people to move away from this site slowly, even there are many other similar sites who take higher margin, but it is more safer platform than Freelancer. What is the point can you imagine you are with them for 7 years, and suddenly just because of one issue they take away your money or block the account? Especially when we have so many customers and reputation, all these takes years to build, which they can just simply block with one click? No one should be in such a dire situation.  Just because of their own incapacity to make others complete the verification process, they just wiped my money from my account. Does anyone see any humanity in such a thing? I can only see a monstrous attitude with absolutely no care. STAY AWAY from this site, dont even waste a second anymore on this site. Another craziest thing was, they also ask me to pay back the money for the project that was completed long ago and successfully completed. I told Freelancer clearly, that the previous money you wiped out from my account was not at all refund to the client. So please send me the proof that this has been done and he really received the money.  And they did not even willing to answer my question and started repeating the message like, please deposit money, please deposit money. Then it strikes me, why they are not answering my questions and keep repeating, maybe I am talking to a chatter bot. All the while i thought I was talking to a real human being who has same emotions and feelings like me.  By repeating what it can achieve? Or by avoiding not answering my question if it thinks, it can achieve anything let it keep thinking that. No smart person will think, by repeating same question again and again he can achieve anything. This is really a dumb bot. So either Freelancer is having chatter bot to resolve customer support issues, or maybe they put people from junior high school as their support staff. No mature person will avoid answering a question. Apart from the above funny bot issue, my question is what happened to the money they wiped from my account ? It is not in my account, my client also did not receive it. So where it went? I am sure any body can make some educated guess on that.",1,freelancer.com

559,"Freelancer doesn't care about its customers/employees. At all. While the ability to easily access and bid on freelance work sounds extremely appealing (and IS, when executed properly), this company fell short in EVERY POSSIBLE way and experience.  Freelancer does nothing to verify the authenticity of employers who are looking for freelancers. They do not require you verify payment methods (like connecting a bank account or credit card) before posting jobs for freelancers. They do not require you verify your email or name either. I was completely scammed on a writing job and Freelancer said that it isn't their ""job"" to protect the freelancers, verify job authenticity, nor hold the employer accountable. Actually YES, that is exactly the point of the site. Otherwise, I'd go to craigslist. Freelancer had NO problem charging me a fee for helping me to ""find work,"" but when the employer scammed me out of hundreds of dollars, and just never paid, they made me fight tooth an nail for weeks to get a refund on the fee - which was more than reasonable to have since they DIDN'T actually assist in me working a legitimate project. I with NEVER work with anyone from Freelancer again, and I have already warned everyone I know about this terrible experience. Protect your freelancers and employers. Require verified payment methods on BOTH sides before any party can post a project or accept work. When someone posts a project and accepts a freelancer's bid, hold the agreed upon cost until the job is submitted to the employer. This isn't rocket science. The point of your site is to make people feel safe, not scammed by the employer and then scammed again by you. So disappointing. **Update** Yes. My issue with the fee reimbursement is NOW taken care of through chat. It should not take that many attempts. It shouldn't be charged until the freelancer is paid. It should not take a representative saying ""it appears we've already refunded you"" when he actually refunded me right then and there (as I was literally looking at the balance at the top of the screen) - it also has a date stamp next to the refund... I can see when it happened and that he did it while we were talking. Even then, he couldn't just say ""I'm so sorry; let me take care of that for you. He had to just pretend it already happened.

They took the first payment out of my credit card account and then continued to bang the card until they got the second payment. I don't think that's even legal! Supposedly they put the money into my Freelancer account. Good luck taking your money back from that account! The third project cost me overdraft fees because they took ALL the money for the three separate milestones which was over $3k. I only released one! I spent my entire day going back and fourt with my freelancer and their customer service reps just to get a bunch of lousy answers. My freelancer was just as shocked as I was.

563,"To cut a long story short I've been scammed many times on Freelancer at least five times in eighteen months. They don't care well I suppose if you had over 17 million subscribers why should they? If you pay for a service you expect some support. They never respond to emails and when they do it's always read the terms and conditions in Section 19 they take no responsibility. They are just a bunch of mindless drones with little personality, poor direction and minimal common sense.  I did not sign up to be scammed nor did I sign up to work for nothing. The problem lies with their methods and the policies they hide behind. Those at director level must lead a very comfortable lifestyle. Why not take the fees and tell the Freelancer that they won't be paid as the money used comes from a ""questionable"" source. Then refund the PM the money they paid for offering the project keeps everyone happy apart from the Freelancers who have paid a fee to deliver a project then find they finish out of pocket. This equates to theft and taking money under false pretences. All you get when you complain is refer to section 19 which basically deflects any responsibility from Freelancer. They basically encourage fraudulent practices How is the Freelancer suppose to check each project and ensure that the funds aren't coming from an untrustworthy source? We aren't mind readers nor is the project likely to be from a business down the road which you may already have knowledge of so you might know? You have to accept the project is genuine and you will be paid. There is always the risk that you won't unlike Freelancer who are guaranteed to be paid for every job! They also cancelled a transaction for £220 for work I did for a PM one day. I provided the service they advised the payment was suspect and reversed it. Consequently I did work for nothing. They advised they tried to contact the PM but of course he was long gone as he got something for nothing. I also had to pay fees for work I delivered by accepting the project Freelancer apparently encourage and openly condone the posting of scam projects. When I have reported scam projects the adverts have been removed then resubmitted several days later I have evidence of this. I've filed court proceedings against Freelancer to recover the £220 but I won't hold my breath they must have loads of them to work through mine will be at the bottom of the pile! In the meantime they say I owe them $117 for fees accrued from work I never undertook. More chance of them seeing that than me walking around the supermarket and bumping into Elvis Presley by the pizza counter.  You stand your ground and fight your corner and they take exception. I then opened a new account to circumnavigate the issue. Made a business contact who was happy to employ me and they decided to close the account as a duplicate. More revenue lost there and a guy who must think I'm an ungrateful cretin. Thanks a bunch Freelancer  You have been warned steer clear it will cost you money and your reputation. Added - 20/01/16 As you can see from the Freelancer response more swerving the subject and trying to placate and diffuse the situation by trying to convey the impression they actually care Freelancer have screwed me over twice in their efforts to protect the community not to mention the money I have lost due to being scammed by scammers on the Freelancer site.  All empty words as usual I'm afraid and empty words tend to fall on deaf ears. Don't use Freelancer It's a pity I can't close my account as I supposedly owe them money for fees for work I never got otherwise I'd do it tomorrow! Update 16/07/2016 Well we are over seven months since I took legal action to recover my monies and as I write I've still not heard anything. The crooks haven't even had the decency to acknowledge my claim so this shows what a corrupt operation they run. So if you can't beat them then they expect you to join them? I guess until they wake up and smell the coffee all I can do is keep posting on here and reminding other Freelancers what a shower of sh1t Freelancer are and would advise sensible people to keep well away. Over 1,000 reviews on here and 850 negatives lol The only way to deal with this people is to vote with your feet and cancel your membership and don't pay any fees or take any of their pointless tests. If people as one unite disappear then their money will soon dry up. We are all to blame by keeping this sinking vessel afloat If they were in the US or UK they would have been shut down years ago but because they flout the system by having a virtual/correspondence address in Australia and rent an office in the Philippines they don't come under any scrutiny. Anyway that's me done for today's moan life is too short to think about these vvankers got to make money elsewhere Update 14/08/2016 After a long legal and email battle Freelancer have finally reinstated my account and waived all fees. I've lost my £220 as they won't budge on the apparent fraudulent payment as it implicates them but its a start. I kept asking to speak to their CEO who for some reason was never available? In the end determination and wanting to clear my name got me there and the fact they couldn't be bothered to argue with me anymore. Don't know if I'll be bothered to actually bid again on anything as I can't be going through this rigmarole every time I accept a project. 16 months to resolve something which should have been resolved in a matter of days. As a footnote I notice that the more recent reviews are all of a sudden favourable after 870 out of 1050 negative reviews? Now I would never insinuate foul play or of course question genuine feedback but it does seem odd that Freelancer(s) have all of a sudden started heaping praise on a business that clearly fails on business ethics and chooses to operate in an apparent scattergun manner with little sympathy to the freelancers who pay to use their services So either Freelancer have significantly changed their business model for the better (yeah right!) which lets face it wouldn't be difficult or maybe just maybe have recruited people to write favourable reviews to boost their ratings?

Now, is Thursday, but he remembered the his apples left after eating apples during Monday are 30 pieces after that, he gave the half of all his apples to her daughter. How many apples left, if today is Friday after eating the two pieces of apples?"" At least three other questions on the test had issues, such as multiple correct answers or no correct answer. Needless to say, this is completely unprofessional, especially considering these are paid tests. How can I showcase my skills to prospective clients with a test like this?

I contacted customer support and 4 days later I was told they do not refund the exam fees. Instead, they offered to let me take another exam for free and they offered me one free month of the lowest paid membership option. First, there's no way I'm ever taking another exam for that site, free or not. Second, because of the exam that I did take I was already eligible for one free month of a higher-level paid membership, so offering me the lowest one is completely pointless. Based on this experience and the countless other reviews I've read about this site, I just decided to cut my losses and run. I advise you all to avoid this shady site.",1,freelancer.com

568,"I am a new user a freelancer and mostly have had a ""OK"" experience. Last month an employer decided not to pay for weeks, so they could keep asking for updates every time they wanted them. The project did not mention ""unlimited support"", so I thought going into arbitration would reveal the clear lies from the employer on Freelancer messenger. However, in spite of screen shots showing the delivered products, clear communication between employer and myself showing the the employer was being abusive, I lost the arbitration. The employer is now allowed to continue with this behavior without penalty. On this one project they had already fired four freelancers without pay, so it is a loss for Freelancer.com for workers. It is a win for employer.  But I think that the idea is simple. The people that pay win. This employer had 5+ active projects and many others finished. It does not matter how bad their reviews are because they are spending money. If you are working on a project take every precaution to protect yourself! Freelancer.com will only protect there revenues by protecting the party that spends the most on their site. Good Economics!",1,freelancer.com
569,Please don't use the site because if the employer cancels his project then they reverse the funds without warning so one night you have 30$ in your account and the next day it's -500$ and it gets deducted from your payment source.,1,freelancer.com
570,"Though many reviews posted here already paint a clear picture of the poor management of this site, I wanted to provide my own recent experience with them. Having a very specific focus and skill set within a small, well connected industry, I came to learn that someone I knew through my professional network had had begun a project and was in search of contractors. I searched through numerous other websites until I discovered that they had posted about the project here. I was ultimately selected as the contractor for the project as I have extensive experience and insight into the industry. Though we had no contact with each other during the course of the bidding process, I was required to perform extensive ""identity verification"" which was anything but. Despite their own TOS and UA forms stating otherwise, I was told that anyone with a pre-existing connection cannot perform business on their platform--though I have not had any contact with the buyer in years (having met more than a decade ago). I have since contacted the buyer directly, and we will no longer be using Freelancer for the entirety of the project. Why would someone want to use a site where the only potential contractor is someone who is not of the same industry and does not have the necessary knowledge?",1,freelancer.com
571,"Be careful! Fraud! Don't use the services of Freelancer.com!  Hi! I want to share my experience about Freelancer.com. First thing I can say I was very dissapointed. First thing you have to do when you come to this platform you need to register and to provide information about your credit card for ""verification of your identity"". Ok...Then you start to bid, then you find that most of the projects there are fake and there's no guarantee that you will be payed for your job as for me I've made a work for one project, and then employee just stopped answering me, so I remained not payed for my job, and my appeals to the support team of Freelancer.com didn't help. At the same time for this project Freelancer.com charged me (from my credit card) with 5 euro. So the fees they are taking for projects don't mean that they gonna protect you in any way. Then appeared one strange project created specially for me with name ""project for rafaellaburtman"" - this project was prorosed to me and awarded to me and inspite that I didn't accept this project Freelancer.com took from me the fee in amount 15.38 euro from my credit card without my agreement. Much time passed and I still didn't get my money back.  Conclusion: when you try to work on Freelancer.com you lose money, but not gain. I've lost 20 euro while just trying to find a job there so my advice to all Freelancers is to find another source and not to be a victim of frauders.",1,freelancer.com

I highly recommend that everyone emails their sitejabber.com reviews to these guys, so we can get freelancer.com closed down! Now here is my review: I was grossly misinformed by freelancer support staff 3 times, which led me to pay $161 for a design that I didn't authorise. I told customer support staff that I would file a claim with paypal to get my money back, and they said ""we don't advise doing this because it will cause an account issue"". I filed a claim anyway, because that is coersion! And now feelancer are saying that my account is in a NEGATIVE balance of $161, and they have not paid any money to paypal. I am waiting for paypal to resolve this issue. I recommend steering clear of this site, it is very very dodgy. Update: They have responded saying: Hi, Emma. Your account shows that you are currently having issues with regard to the deposits that you made. We strongly recommend you to do two things for this issue to be resolved: 1) Kindly refer to the Verification Center for further updates and/or instructions from our Support; 2) To coordinate with PayPal with regard to the deposit/s. We would like to assure you that we will assist you with your concern until your account issue is resolved. Thank you for your cooperation. Take care. Firstly, their verification centre rejected my verification and CONTINUES to hold onto my money. I have sent so so many emails that have not been responded to - this is the first response via this website. Of course they will try to save face, but read all the other HUNDREDS of reviews on sitejabber.com for other people who have been scammed. It is beyond a joke.

All freelancer does is encourage you and freelancer to communicate, which is only messaging. But t seems Freelancer can not see any of the message chains nor ""the work"" submitted.

That I was running 3 accounts under 1 user. And it's not true. We were actually 3 persons and each of us had account. Then freelancer.com said if that's the case that means we 3 persons are exchanging projects to each other to get fake reviews. That's also not true!! Why will we do that when we all 3 have already a lot of reviews??? So please stay away from this site. None of you are secure at the site.

Here is their address. If anyone is local? It would be worth a peek with pictures for sure lol! Freelancer.com Makati Sky Plaza, 21st floor Ayala Avenue Makati City (Metropolitan Manila) Philippines  I opened a criminal inquiry on this scam artist extraordinaire. Doubt that it will do much before my bank charges them back. But at least the authorities are now aware of their little hole in the wall scam. We used to pay our freelancers through Elance. But after they shut down, we thought we'd try another platform... Freelancer.com. WHAT A MISTAKE! We had our guys set up accounts. And then we transferred 967.00 to two providers. The first payment was 18 days ago. My provider said they had to verify the payment with us. They didn't send any type of notification. They just 'seized' his funds. So we reached out to Freelancer... no response. Again... no response. Opened a Paypal dispute.  And all of the sudden there is a response. They want to 'verify' the transaction. They called from a restricted number, refused to provide a call back number stating their entire company runs off of Skype Business. (BS. They are just masking the fact that they are located in one of the scam capitols of the world... the Phillipines.) So they said they were going to release the funds. We told them when they did that we would drop the dispute.  Next we get an email saying we have to close the dispute before the release the funds. (BS) If we do that and they do not release the funds to the provider, we cannot reopen the dispute. So now we have had to escalate the dispute to a full blown Paypal case because these extortion artists like to steal peoples' money according to my experience and others on this board. Believe this. All freelance boards are NOT created equal. These guys are like little league vs. the majors.  Their customer service sucks. The average provider on this board sucks. And they are thieves. Stay away.

For the one where the client owes me $300, the client was responsive at first but now doesn't respond to my messages, even though I can see she has been online every day. The second on is Indian or Pakistani, and he even went so far as to mock me when I said I would open a ticket with support. He keeps putting me off, saying ""give me a few more days"". I've opened a ticket for the one that owes me $300 (or thereabouts) and it appears the client isn't even responding to Freelancer.com now.

They wanted ""clear, unaltered photos"" (done), a government-issued ID (done), and a recent utility bill, phone bill etc. to show true residency (done). Fine. I did all that. After a week or so, they told me that they couldn't verify me, but I'd passed two of their three checks. Once you're in, the fine print says you have the option of paying them an extra monthly fee (at various membership levels) to increase your visibility. Oh, and every bid will cost you 3% or $3 USD, whichever is greater, which is actually not bad. Some sites I've seen charge as much as 20% for each bid you deliver on.

So in other words, I need to pay them first in order for them to potentially pay me, *IF* I won a bid for a job (yes, like many other freelancing sites, it's bid-based, like an eBay for jobs.) No thank you. That's not how I do business, and I refuse to ""pay to play"". Stay away from this company at all costs, seriously. .............. EDITED UPDATE (In response to the feedback below) Hello Freelancer Rep, thank you for your response to my feedback. I found my overall experience (beyond the initial hopes that this would be a suitable source for legit freelance jobs, as indicated above) to be quite bad, I'm afraid. I'll accept that verification may be required for certain types of employers, for tax purposes or other business reasons, but as for ""skill tests"", I can only say that 1) your process needs vast efficiency improvements, and 2) freelancers should emphatically *NOT* be the ones paying for these proficiency tests. Their skills and abilities should be self-evident from both their profiles, as well as the bid proposals they submit. Please take a look at your competitors' websites to see how this works, in particular, eLance / Upwork. No verification process, no money required for a multitude of optional skills tests, and just as many projects to bid on as your site. Also, withholding funds from your freelancers, cancelling projects without payment, etc. hurts your business as well as your reputation. I hope you pass this information up the management chain, unless your company is OK with the majority of reviews on this site that are tainting your reputation. Best regards. - Roger",1,freelancer.com
610,"Hi So I did everything that MUST be done from MY side, a new NORMAL employer registers on freelancer.com, and posts a NORMAL project that he was having some problems with this website viewing on iOS devices... Now I(almost 5 years on freelancer.com) bidded on this project and SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED it, and both me and the employer left each other excellent feedback.  Now when it comes to withdrawing MY correctly WORKED money, I get a ""withdrawal cancelled"" email that the money I want to withdraw came from an account that is under review now... so freelancer.com WANTS for no reason to Verify the Newly registered NORMAL PERSON employer... and I for no LOGIC reason can't withdraw MY WORKED money out because they have THEIR ""issues"" with the employer.... Freelancer.com really should think about Their FREELANCERS because it's because of us why your site is popular and why you have millions of $$ !!!!!!!!!!!!! It really feels like a total SCAM and this is against ANY LAWS to keep my money for no reason from my side, it's MY worked TIME and POWERS!!!!!!!

612,"I had high hopes for the Freelancer website and actually traded some Freelancer shares in the ASX around a year ago. I created an account 4 days ago and deposited $40AUD. I took two exams and thought they were $5.50 USD each, but didn't realise there were all these transaction/ currency conversion fees associated with them (I thought this was an Australian company and I'm based in Australia - how does this work??). I started bidding for some projects and was misled into believing that sponsor fee would only come out if a project is won and also that the sponsor fee would come out of the employer's fund, not mine. I was awarded one project yesterday. The employer had not deposited any funds, but I was already charged the project fee. Upon reflection, most of the project descriptions are very vague and are probably fake projects so that the site can siphon money from the hopeful work-seekers. I sent in highly private information such as my identification docs and credit card details. I hope the company abides by the Australian law and terminate my account properly i.e. permanently deleting my private information. I only thought to look into others' review of the site after my bad experience, and there are so many awful reviews out there. I have promptly terminated my account and will raise this matter with the ACCC and have them look into the operation of the Freelancer site. I'm not sure how an Australian business can operate under this sort of ethics. This is a dangerous site and it would seem that a lot of people out there have lost a lot of money. This is simply not right. Stay away!",1,freelancer.com

615,Freelancer do not really protect buyers from fraudulent sellers. I had a designer who completed 75% of my website and I was releasing milestones bit by bit. Then the designer suddenly stopped and I never heard from them again. I asked Freelancer the step it as I had lost over £500 and had nothing to show for it. Freelancer refunded me £150. I asked for the designers details as I wanted to take them to court but Freelancer would not give them. I kept asking Freelancer customer serivce for help but they took me round in circles. Eventually I opened a paypal case against Freelancer to get my money back. When this happened. Freelancer took down a milestone I had with another designer and stole the money. This was in the beginning of October and it is not mid-November. My account is still limited and my money is still gone (£815) in Total. This is a pathetic company with 0 customer service.

618,"Short version: Freelancer.com wins money when the employer creates the project and when a worker accept it. Both times freelancer.com gets his money no matter what happens afterwards. The ideal scenario for freelancer.com is to have lots and lots of employers, even if they are thief's, scammers, it doesn't matter, freelancer.com is winning money with this. Long version: The first project an employer accepts me, it was for $70 and I payed $7 to freelancer.com the moment I accept to do the work. The employer didn't want to make the milestone payment but since he has 12 5-star reviews I accept to do the work first. After 3 days of work, the employer wants more stuff done even thought I've done everything that was in the project. I've said I would do it after the payment, since I already has done the job. Then, the employer reviews me with 1-star, marked the project as incomplete. AND USED THE SITE I DONE AS HIS MAIN WEBSITE. Since when I showed him the site, he just steal all the code. His was malicious since the beginning because I put the site on air for just 10 minutes so he can see the project, but he already know how stuff works and grabbed the code. The fun stuff starts now. Since he didn't pay me I can't review him. WTF? That's why he has 12 5-star reviews in 120 projects! I didn't know that before, but if someone has lots of projects and few reviews DONT ACCEPT IT. If we can just review when we get paid, it's obvious we'll review for 5-star. That way employers never gets bad reviews. And keep posting projects and getting the results for only $3. And freelancer.com keep winning money. And workers losing it... The result for me (worker): Minus $7. Work 3 days. Get a 1-review (less chance of find work). The result for employer: Pay $3 (pay to create the project) to get a FULL HOMEPAGE DONE! The result for freelancer.com: Won $10 While they don't change that skewed review system THE SITE IS UNUSABLE. Since the employer is a thief I'm posting his data. If I can't do that please remove the links THE EMPLOYER https://www.freelancer.com/u/jeremiahfarris.html?ref_project_id=8857504 THE SITE (I""VE MADED IT but with good quality, the guy is so bad that he screwed it to put it online haha, way better deal to pay the $70 and get a good site) http://eternityready.com (A christian site by the way) UPDATE: They reply my ticket: ""Hello Luis, Thank you for contacting Freelancer.com Support. We understand your frustration regarding this. As previously mentioned, the option to leave a feedback and ratings is only available for both parties once the project is completed. Moreover, the feedback system is between an employer and their freelancer and it is not designed for us to intervene."" --- As you can see the feedback is only available for BOTH parties after the project is complete. But BEFORE that the employer can give you 1-star and you can't review him. It'd make more sense for BOTH parties give review AFTER the project is done.

622,"I've been working on freelancer.com for many years with 5 star ratings, although I was never happy with their process of taking fees compared to other reputable sites (like Elance and Upwork). Instead of taking the fee from the freelancer once the project is complete and the client pays, FL takes the fee as soon as you accept the project. So if the client doesn't pay you, you're screwed and FL still made their money. Just yesterday, I completed a project and had $33 in my account, so I set up a withdrawal. I logged in last night and happen to see my account suddenly had only $5.18 and when I went to the financials page, it said I didn't have enough funds to withdraw. So after looking through the transaction history and deciphering all of the accounting lingo, I figured out that FL had reversed a payment I was paid 2 months ago on Sept 1st by a client! I emailed them asking what was going on but have not received a reply. I saw that the client profile was removed so I can only gather that somehow the client's payment method was bad. But why did it take 2 MONTHS for this to turn about? And what is the point of creating a milestone payment, which is supposed to protect a freelancer and ensure we are paid, if the payment method and funds are not 100% verified and available? FL should make sure of that before a client is even allowed to post a project. That seems like a total scam! So now I am out money, and the project I did for that mystery client was basically for free since FL took the money back and I cannot believe they can get away with it.

Freelancer also deleted (they say the user deleted it, why should a user be allowed to delete a project that was handed over!) the project that is a deliberate act to remove evidences of a misdeed. I immediately acted with the following support ticket; ============================================================ Subject: Do you mind clarifying your activities? Summary: I did a project over Freelancer.Com following all the rules and regulations. The project was completed successfully and the client also made feedback and payment. Then all of a sudden Freelancer.Com decided to lock down the fund with some issues on the client's end. And finally I see (guess) Freelancer.Com just reversed the payment from the client while the job has already been done and delivered. In simple sentence, Freelancer.Com decided not to pay me for my work. (Please feel free to browse my earlier tickets to know the fact, I am not in a mood to type it down here all over again) Documents: Attached are the proof that; a. The client was handed over with the deliverables at his satisfaction. b. Freelancer reversed the associated payments; Misdeed by Freelancer.Com: The project was DELETED! a. Why should a COMPLETED & DELIVERED project be deleted? b. Why should a payment be reversed for a COMPLETED & DELIVERED project? c. I was not notified of the payment reversal or of the project removal via email! My requirements: I really need the URL/PDF of your policy in written format so I can forward the entire matter to the Department of Justice, Australia because it is very much clear that you are not at your intention to resolve the matter in an ethically correct way. I also need that policy document for a circulation over the social media available like Site Jabber and others. Thank you very much for all your so called support and assistance. It is pretty eminent that my days over here has come to an end.

Project deleted: http://postimg.org/image/paabslp5v/ And here goes their response! ============================================================ Hi there, I understand that you have concerns about a reversed payment for a project that you have completed. If you are referring to the project ""Self-destruct private note php script"" with project ID 8525609, the project was deleted and the employer's account was closed. The employer's account was closed because it was found that they violated the site's Terms and Conditions and the payments that they released to you have to be reversed to its original payment source. This was done as a security measure because we do not want you to be held liable on funds that came from a questionable source. Keeping those funds in your account might cause more issues on your end and, we dont want that to happen. You can know more about the site's Terms and Conditions by going to this link. I suggest that you check sections 18-22: https://www.freelancer.com/about/terms As an extension of our support, we can send an email to the employer and we can request them to communicate with you and settle the payment off-site. Let us know if you want to proceed with that by replying here. We will be expecting your reply. Let us know if you other issues or concerns, thank you. --- Regards, Cyril C. Freelancer.com Support ============================================================ What a caring system! Wow!!! They don't want me to fall under legal penalties for the money source of the employer!!! Someone please kill me! And what is there in the sections 18-22?

And the sole decisoin maker is the Freelancer.Com godly entity... lol The support staff was prompt enough to show me the terms and conditions, but just forgot to mention their policy to secure the worker's intellectual property/labor!

Note that the proper department has notified your employer and mentioned the issues that have to be resolved through the Verification Center. We'll just have to wait for your employer's response to resolve this issue. As per our Privacy Policies, we cannot disclose any detailed information about the specific issues."" However, they still don't answer me what is the time period they want to wait for the client's response and what will happen afterwords if the client fails/doesn't respond to their verification request. I do have the right to know this information, don't I? And I believe I am asking for a policy clarification, nothing related to any private/personal information, isn't it? UPDATE: Too bad! Just had a LIVE CHAT (after about a hundred attempts) with the support and the support personnel just left the chat without answering my questions! Below is the link to the transcript; http://www.filedropper.com/freelancercom-livechaton22october2015 ORIGINAL REVIEW: A client awarded a project, Freelancer promptly deducted the commission, the job was completed, client accepted the deliverables, client made the payment, Original post: http://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/www.freelancer.com#810 Freelancer.Com added the sum to my financial balance, client put a very positive review and NOW FREELANCER.COM WON'T LET ME WITHDRAW THE FUND because there are some issues with the client's account! Wow!!! Freelancer.Com always seems to detect the fund was not eligible for withdrawal until it is the last moment on the pay day! A database driven online system cannot detect this when I requested the withdrawal? It had to wait for the pay day to come to see this? The terrifying factor is, Freelancer.Com has grown a habit of keeping people in dark about what is really going on with simple phrases like ""Account under review"" and replying to support queries after 5/6 days and so on. And the online live chat service, let us not spoil our days! Freelancer.Com, now where is my time & effort? Where is the commission you already deducted? What will happen if the client doesn't respond at all? How come a project gets the COMPLETE status if the client didn't pay Freelancer.Com? What a logic, the freelancer is liable for the client's account issues! I was even asked to contact the client to resolve the issue, wow! Did I ask the client to come over Freelancer.Com and offer me the job? What is the reason we work through Freelancer.Com than handling clients directly? At this point, Freelancer.Com, you just raised a question with online freelancing platform! BOTTOM LINE: After a number of successful days with them, I AM FRUSTRATED WITH FREELANCER.COM now. Looking for a better platform who at least puts some logical explanation to facts.",1,freelancer.com
641,"Started a competition for design website £550 guaranteed. I then changed the description of competition twice, looked at bank statement and freelancer have too £1650 from my account. Spoke with them and they have told me I requested 3 websites???? I have logged a paypal complaint and freelancer have disputed saying I had downloaded and completed 3 times??? downloaded and completed what exactly? competition ran for 30 minutes before I realised and cancelled all transactions and project. UPDATE Freelancer are now saying to Paypal that the £1650 is a deposit against work done to try and steal the whole lot!!!! Funny how freelancer agents (who read these) are not commenting on this thread??  DO NOT EVER DO A COMPETITION WITH THESE GUYS YOU CAN JUST WAVE GOODBYE TO YOUR MONEY!!! BEWARE, why would freelancer say completed transaction to PAYPAL??? unless they were just a complete SCAM!!!! (have messaged you my username now) UPDATE 6/11 no contact from freelancer have sent my details. Freelancer have now changed their story with Paypal, originally they said I had downloaded all the content, then they said it was for 3 websites (same name ???) and now they are saying it was 3 deposits towards one website. Paypal do not refund deposits!!! This is a FRAUD, they know how to play the system with paypal and are completely lying to try and steal £1500+ from me. I cannot state how much you should do NO business with this outfit. Reporting tomorrow to Action Fraud, whom hopefully will investigate. Not just nicking £20 deposits but they are tyring to steal £1500 !!!!!! WOW !!!!",1,freelancer.com
642,I RARELY write reviews but I am beyond upset. An employer hired me and Freelancer.com charged me a percentage of the bid price that was accepted. The employer decided to not work with me and would NOT cancel the project. I cannot reach her. I have spent weeks trying to get a reasonable reply from Freelancer. I finally got someone on live chat who told me that I had to put in a request to cancel 7 days after the expiration of the project. I was told I would not receive a refund. Then I was told that the project would automatically close after 28 days and that I will have to request a refund again and an investigation would be done. Then I was told that the fees are non-refundable. The guy on the live chat would not provide me with a contact number to speak to someone and ended the chat by simply saying he couldn't help me anymore. I am now out of money for a service I was unable to provide and Freelancer is a scam. STAY AWAY!!!!! REPLY TO FREELANCERS RESPONSE- It has NOT been resolved. You still have my money and I have to invest the time to call back and go through the whole process 28 days after the project expired. I am not investing another freaking minute trying to resolve this. To have to wait that long after a project is cancelled to request a refund that I was told I would not get anyway is a waste of time. I will cut my losses and continue to warn everyone about Freelancer.,1,freelancer.com

However few hours later, my account balance turned to negative and i was penalized. I asked the company why didn't they hold funds of emplyer and penalized him for trapping innocent people?

Not too mention the fact that they just bill you for services that you never ever signed up to. Thankfully I had credit card problems because when I did, I reviewed my history and saw they had billed me for some subscription plan that I had no idea about.

646,"Hello, due to all the problems you mentioned I heard that a new website about freelancing was recently launched. It's name is FreelanceTarget.com I checked their price list and comparison table and it's really cheap. Nothing to be paid for the workers!! The site is populating right now but I think we can give to them a chance, personally I have to revenge all the money that Freelancer.com took from my account with noreason at all!!",1,freelancer.com
647,"This site is a nightmare. The support system is there to deflect issues, there is literally no dispute system (it's only there to take some of your money and allow the employer not to pay for work). More then half of the employers are scammers, and they complete less then 30% of the projects they create. The contest system is rigged, and they manipulate the number of projects. Half of the projects in every category are already over. They charge for everything like tests, bids, disputes. I made 900$ in the span of 6 months, and this month I am down 15$. So if you plan on scamming people for free work, by all means, this is the site for you. If you plan to work, stay away from this site. I ended up loosing 15$ on my last 5 projects. Only one of them was paid, and I lost money on all other 4, because of the freelancer fee they make you pay before project starts.",1,freelancer.com

Ok done send mail and after 5 hours to get a response from them : "" We regret to inform you that your account has been closed by Freelancer.com administration.

So ia basicly i worked for free all my work go 0 paid !! Stay away from freelancer.com, trust me you will regrate using them !!! I realy hate to post reviews , this is my first review!",1,freelancer.com
651,"I am not someone who like to post reviews around, but freelancer.com did something that really upset me. I signed up with freelancer.com long ago, back when they were still getafreelancer.com. For years things had been great, I am an employer who used the website to connect with freelancers. I had a 5-star profile, that is, all freelancers who worked with me in the past gave high remarks. I never leave anyone unpaid, whether the projects turn out to be good or bad. It all started few months ago when I uploaded some funds to my account (via credit card), freelancer.com payment system charged me several times for that one deposit. I contacted their support and they keep escalating the issues without giving me a proper response. It seems like they are just not interested to solve it. After a while I got fed up with them and went to my bank to reverse the transactions. I thought it all worked out. It is common sense that if I made a deposit of $30, and you ridiculously charged me several times up to $150, I would had to reverse the $120 transaction. But freelancer.com doesn't think so. Once the bank made the chargebacks they limit my account and asked me for verification (i.e. sending personal documents). I told them it wasn't my fault that they made several unauthorized charges on my card and the bank reversed the transactions for me. With an experience like that, can I still trust them with my personal info? Their accountants or finance staff should liaise with me when I first contacted them, but no, I didn't receive any helpful response.I suggest they run through their accounting statement, by which they would find they had charged me for the same thing multiple times. But no, they refused to hear what I have to say, and they soon suspended my account, that means taking all the remaining money in it. It doesn't matter that you took my money, I will forget it in a while. But I will post reviews on here and other websites so everyone can read it for a long time. If your company's credibility is affected, it is karma for what you did. I had been a good customer and never cause any problems for you all these years but then you brought this on me. Today you lost me forever, keep doing such business practices and tomorrow you may lose everyone else. To everyone reading this, I do not recommend you use freelancer.com, they used to be good but this is no longer the case. Nowadays there are so many issues of financial dishonesty towards their users. Yes they may be a public listed company, but that doesn't matter if on the ground they treat people like you and me badly, and that somehow our money in their system may 'disappear'. Stay away, there are many better alternatives to go for.",1,freelancer.com

We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused you. Your account was screened by our system and it detected a probable cause for liability to the site. This is the reason why it has been closed. Due to unique circumstances, we have reopened your account. Once a project is deleted though, it cannot be retrieved. Hence, we advise that you post new projects on the account to move forward. We highly recommend to continue working on our site since we have a lot opportunities here. Also, we hope that this experience has not affected your view of Freelancer.com and that you would continue to utilize its services.  Let us know if you have other queries or concerns."" Seriously, stay away from these scammers. *UPDATE*09.10.15 They recovered my account by saying that it was an ""honest mistake"". It looks like they made a habit out of closing accounts for no reason at all. By the way, both of my projects are deleted, and the trust I had from the freelancers is crashed by this ""honest mistake"". Now they probably think that the projects were fake. Freelancer.com has no regard nor respect to its members. I would have never signed up for this website if I cared to read a few reviews here, they are very true. If you are interested in this website's services, go look for similar services, nothing can be worse than freelancer.com! *ORIGINAL POST* I posted a project and many freelancers started bidding. I was in continuous contact with them through freelancer.com and giving them the instructions about the job. And today, suddenly, for no reason at all, my account got closed. No notification, nothing! Online chat cant help you with closed accounts; they cant even tell you why and when it happened, and they are very arrogant unless they sound like a bot. Sent a ticket to support, which is supposed to take days according to their confirmation mail! I needed urgent help, which is promised to be delivered by the online chat in the confirmation mail I got from their ticket system, but it asks me to access my account to get that immediate help. But of course my account is closed... The account became indispensable for the business in just a couple of days, and now I might lose my job for this nonsense. The best part is, they DONT HAVE TO explain why they closed your account.  I was about to pay the freelancers who delivered the job, but now I cant even contact them. I hope they also start writing reviews here about how their employer disappeared before paying them up!  I am writing this review mostly out of frustration and resentment I feel for their support approach, and in hope of recovering my account. Maybe they will let me know what went wrong if they see this review. I also wrote the representative who answers everybody here. They sound much kinder and attentive over here than they do in their online chat. Bad experience so far.",1,freelancer.com

This was done as a security measure because we do not want you to be held liable on funds that came from a questionable source."" They just closed the client's account and now, they are asking me to pay those dues. They do not have any power to get the copyrighted work. They do not have access to the client. They do not ask him to pay the money.  It is the freelancers who will do the work and then also pay money for that work.

You know that you should deduct the fee in the beginning, but you don't take any responsibility. What's the point of working on your website if you cannot provide Escrow protection? You have stolen my work plus my earnings. I am not going to blame the client. It is the freelancer.com that must be blamed for this irresponsible behaviour.  Everyone, please please stay away from this website.It is a good platform to learn about possible scams happening online. It is also a good site to get your feet wet in the online freelancing world, but there are better options.  When this problem happened, I wasn't actively seeking work on this website. Otherwise, I would have easily lost $300 here. And, I have submitted 50,000 words for these $300. Bottom Line: Poor customer support and irresponsible behaviour will kill this website. I got my first client through this site and I had sweet memories, but unfortunately I cannot recommend this platform.  I read all the replies from Lara (Freelancer.com representative).

680,"My personal experience with Freelancer: I wasted my time and money in simple project (content/Article writing) . Project bidders: People with no knowledge and has got good review (don't know how they got good reviews could be paid reviews!!!) and they bid lower price then negotiate the price with you and increase it. Do not deliver project on agreed time and they wont respond for your messages. Once delivered they wont give you time to review and nag you constantly to release the funds for the unworthy work they have delivered. Freelance Accounts: They are many hidden charges which they don't tell you subscribe with them , you have to figure it yourself by checkig the transaction history. some of the hidden charges are. Deposit fee ($.30 Fixed +2.30 %) Project Adding fee + 10% GST Project deletion fee + 10% GST If you got less than 30 AUD in your freelancer account then you can't withdraw funds !!! you are trapped.You have to transfer more funds to match the minimum 30$ so that they can again charge you Deposit fee ($.30 Fixed +2.30 %). My recommendation is use a different outsourcing platform !!! Do not waste your money and time!!!",1,freelancer.com

682,"I've had a few jobs pan out pretty well, but as a very qualified composer, audio services, most of the jobs are not worth responding to, very low price range, many clients don't know what they are looking for and don't have the knowledge in a particular field to ask the right questions. I've had more success on websites that specialize in my particular field of expertise. Also, I provide much info on my resume, past clients, etc, but Freelancer provides no info on prospective clients, bidding for services, what they've done in the past.  Would not recommend for a serious professional.",1,freelancer.com
683,"its a terrible service, partly beacuse the payment systems is bad (frrelancer holds on to my refund for no reason) but most because you get so many offers from freelancers which do not read your job description properly and just want to deliver some stuff to get their money as soon as possible. You need to explain so much to them that you are better of with some real service. Good stuff does cost money. On the last job a freelancer (teambeedesigners) started the job, delivered poor work (actually just copied code from another website) and finally was not able to complete. Smart enough he did not properly accept the job via the freelancer platform so i was not able to give a bad review on freelancer itself. --- Now we are writing 8th of october and i am still waiting for my money which i claimed on 29th august. Freelancer is just playing time but saying refunding is not the same as withdraw - what the heck? And why is it technically possible to withdraw money on their site if i was supposed to claim a refund? It is my money, i paid it into my freelancer account and i can expect to get it back asap. They just make a lot of fuzz about the difference between refund and withdraw with no use apart for themselves. Even now they need another 10 working days to refund it to my PayPal account... so fed up them. Can´t wait to cancel my account with them. Never, never again .....",1,freelancer.com

She finally reappeared after 3 weeks demanding half payment which i refused... to which she responded the work was terrible and she didnt think i would have accepted it anyway??? Finally through dispute process, got money in escrow refunded. Apparently, I can't just withdraw this money, freelancer is hanging on to it, and providing no means for me to reclaim it. I gave up trying to access online chat help, its barely staffed. Freelancer has advised they are keeping a 3.5% finders fee, for ""finding"" the contractor who did nothing. Use a different outsourcing platform people, this one is dodgy as hell. Paypal has now decided in my favor, I got my deposit back AND the stupid commission paid for nothing.

They trick you into going ahead with a service promising money back guarantee if not satisfied printed clear as day for you to see but then in a sneaky way (information you have to go looking for) will tell you it doesn't actually apply to you. I asked them to mediate a situation whereby I paid $250 for a project that was not finished and I couldn't use. They were not able to do this simple request for me. Pretending to care about the customer but did nothing to validate their words. If you do use freelancer there is a company called Afterteam on there based in Sofia, Bulgaria managed by Mr. Kosev.

A foolish idiot even replied to my previous post here and said I had no jobs on the page but actually did and had to go back again to contact customer support who are now supposedly sending out to the employer for resolution. I doubt that will happen. But before Freelancer lets the office fool reply to posts here, he should actually check the full account for jobs accepted.  So NOW...I bid on a virtual assistant/admin assistant job for an art gallery. I accpeted the job and worked for a whole two weeks for this criminal. They posted under the name reedsusan and their actual name they use as a front is merschen cord artistry world. They steal credit cards and have you run them through various merchant accounts they try to force you to put in your name and hope they go through undisputed but the cards are stolen and never go through because they are not a legitimate business and have no liscences needed to complete the accounts and customers will immediately dispute the charges. They did not pay me and I firgured out what was going very quickly on so refunded all charges and shut down all accounts before reporting them to the FBI Cyber Crime Division, BBB, FTC and several other channels. So now I am having clean up a mess due to this posting from freelancer. Please be weary of any jobs on this site. They are fraudulent most of the time and being paid is next to impossible. I have no doubt that the person who posted for the virtual assistant position paid for their account with a stolen credit card. It makes me wonder what actual security measures they have on this page. My identity is not safe here nor have I ever been paid for any job I accpeted here...and I am on other freelnace writing sites where I have had legitimate, paying jobs from reputable entities. This is the only page I have found to be full of it. Not worth the stress, hassle and struggle for a mere $100.00 owed from a verified employer.

691,an employer hired me and other two freelancer for a project. so freelancer.com took the fees of being awarded from all of us. the employer didn't pay the money and still freelancer is saying this fees is not refunded even if you didn't get payed. conclusion they care about collecting money doesn't matter is the way or their client.  you might work for a project and deliver plus you'll pay for the time you worked to freelancer.com and you won't get payed.

692,"Stay away from Freelancer! It's a terrible website with a lot of promise but no delivery and a huge headache! For a multi-million dollar company the support system is terrible ! This is my second time trying to use this website in hopes to have work completed and find the right freelancer for the job. It has been a waste of my time again! Clueless freelancers making false promises! Freelancer should require users to complete skill test before they can bid on certain projects. Then employers clearly know if they are capable of being hired for a job. All freelancer's on freelancer claim they can do the job, just so they can try and get a quick buck, because after you send money it is not refundable. That doesn't help anyone except keep employers frustrated by wasting time and money with no results.  I contact the customer service chat, only to get talked to in circles and refer me to the FAQ page. I have to contact support again just to see if Tier 2 had resolved my issue. Why can't I talk to tier 2 right away? Why is there no confirmation email? It feels like I'm being scammed! I want to know that I'll receive the quality work I was promised in a timely matter. I tried to transfer my project to another user. The customer chat instructions told me to end the project early, but now I am required to pay another deposit? It makes no sense! Freelancer clearly states, that when a project is accepted a fully refundable deposit is available. If that was true, they would not hassle people when you try to get a refund and they would not keep any money including the project fees. I have no problem paying for a project fee if the work I'm paying for is finished and received, but no work was ever received. After days of trying to get my money back, they then limited my account and had me submit verification records before I could access my account again, even though my money is on there. I also had to cancel my disputes with Paypal against them before they would make my account active again. Finally they send me my 4 deposit refunds but one of the refund is only saying partially refunded? So they're still trying to keep a portion of it? That is definitely not cool with me! This is business not charity, I paid for a service I did not receive, so I expect 100% of my money back. Freelancer won't hesitate to take people's money but Freelancer can't refund it in a timely matter? They want me to wait 3 weeks for a refund, but they can take money in seconds from your account no problem? Freelancer doesn't even give you an alert when they take the small ""project fees"" from your account I had to contact Paypal over the phone and explain to them the whole situation Paypal has sided with me and Freelancer will not be keeping any portion of my money! Freelancer it's simple! If your website does not hold up to it's part and provide the work people are depositing money for, then you have no right to retain any amount of money for a service you were unable to provide.

694,"I have been struggling to withdraw my earnings from Freelancer for two months now. Their system of creating a milestone is supposed to protect all parties involved as it holds the employer's deposit until the project is approved or cancelled. They strongly recommend it and I followed their guidelines. Everything went well the amount reflected in my Freelancer account after the project was approved and released but it took 2 months for me to get any information of when I will see the money in my bank. I finally got an email in the last week stating that the employer's money never cleared to begin with and they have deducted it from my account, although they happily kept the commission they took on the project even though payment wasn't made. I think firstly they shouldn't have allowed me to believe that the deposit was ready and waiting if it hadn't yet in fact been deposited. I went ahead on the job knowing the milestone would protect me and that was false information. Secondly when I try to sort it out with their support team they send you in circles and don't actually do a thing. Eventually I contacted the employer directly and he assures me that the full amount was debited from his account 2 months ago. How do I escalate this? How do I find out which side is the cause of the error? Freelancer's attitude is that it's not their problem and they're terribly sorry about that. $#@!

711,"My user profile says I am a member since 2006. That is because I think they either bought my name or got it from one of the various companies they bought that I may have used in the past. I posted to have a web site done and got many responses within two days. Most of them had not read what I was trying to do. A few did and seemed very qualified. I gave the award to a freelancer. Here is where they started taking money as fast as they could and from where ever they could.  To get going I entered a new credit card (Bank A) and authorized payment of the full contract amount to this credit card. They had info on another credit chard (Bank B) I did not want to use for this project. I was charged more at Bank A, but said to myself, ok this must include their fees. But for transparency, I thought then they should have itemized everything like a real vendor before a customer would click yes. (I should have stopped Bank A authorizing the charge at that moment when what I clicked yes to did not match the charge. ) Then at the same time suddenly I was boosted to a full member status without warning. (I never asked for this, and it would mean monthly charges in the future.) And then this: They also -- and at the same time -- made various charges to the Bank B credit card. (The one I did not use) The first one got through, but my bank -- before I even knew it was going on -- stopped the other charge for over 1,600. I only recently found out about that. So then I wanted to release initial funds to the contractor to get started on the project -- a first milestone. Thinking that I had funds in the account (I just paid a bunch of money) I wanted to release a portion to the freelancer to start. It is fair and shows good will on my part.  With this they billed the milestone payment (plus more fees) to my credit card again for this same project.  Granted, maybe I made an erro in their system charging myself again: Butt it is clear that they have designed their system for lack of transparency and to get as much as they can as fast as they can through confusion for both freelancer and employer.  (Isn't this how all scammers work?) Seeing my error, I immediately contacted customer support requesting a reverse of the charge I made to my credit card and Bank A in error.  (Keep in mind at this point I did not realize they also made a series of test charges to Bank B, then one smallish charge of around 30.00 before their attempt to double bill the project to Bank B.)  Customer support gave all the BS reasons why they could not do a reverse on the charge in error to Bank A. They said I had to deal with the freelancer and go to my bank. It was not about solving a problem they could, it was about pushing me off. I won't bore you with the insane back and forth. But again, this is how scammers operate. Then I called my bank and tried to get a stop on that payment I made in error. (It has since gone through.) Meanwhile, I detected there was a stop on that credit card at Bank B as it kept getting rejected why trying to conduct my daily business. Low and behold, Freelancer.com had been trying to make charges against that card as well and I did not know it until my bank smelled something fishy going on. And not only that. At the same time I unfortunately entered the trap of freelancer.com various charges were being made by a software company I had never heard of.  So there were not only unauthorized charges at Bank B by Freelancer.com but also my card had been obviously compromised through their system. Being upset with these fast folding developments, I then cancelled the project over Freelancer.com. I then tried to cancel my membership. But they won't let me. Nor can I get the funds of over thousands back from them. I am now out thousands of dollars for nothing. They have probably also charged the freelancer even though he no longer has the project. Hey, I am willing to let them keep the 30-some dollars they did successfully take from Bank B where no charges were authorized. I'll write that off as a commission they can keep for allowing me to post my project on their site.  But not the thousands they took from Bank A. So in short freelancer.com  1. doubled charged me for one project on two different credit cards, 2. Broke up charges into different fees, unbeknownst to me 3. Did not provide an itemized invoice before clicking the charge approval (like Amazon or any real merchant would) 4. Refused to reverse a large charge made in error (they could have done that immediately, as all honest merchants do all the time. (With the contracted project fully funded they could see that it was an error.) 5. Apparently, almost surely, compromised my card at Bank B (where they did test charges first, and then tried to double bill the project. 6. Have refused to allow me to end my membership even though my project with them is cancelled.  This is not only terrible for me (it has cost me thousands of dollars and now the project may not be done) but for the freelancer as well as now he does not have the business and it is no way for good freelancers to get business over a platform like that. Now, if Freelancer. com refunds my money (they can keep the unauthorized money they got from Bank B as their commission for posting my project.) I will revisit this posting and make good.  But for now my strong advice is to stay away, far away from Freelancer.com Update in response to Freelancer's rely.  1. I never upgraded the project. That is bunk. 2. I was charged on two credit cards for one project. 3. I made an milstone charge to my credit card in error when there were already sufficient funds in my account (eventough Freelancer confused me by saying there was a -0- account. 4. I cancelled the project after all those charges were made.  5. As your your ticket? Huh? Why would I give you my bank details after you already compromised my credit card? All you need to do is reverse the funds directly. You know that. Stop scamming. Stop the lies to your own customers upon which you depend for your survival.  Like I said, RUN AWAY FAST from freelancer.com Hope this information helps you Freelancer and take care !!!  PS: By The Way, Freelancer.com, did you ever wonder why you have practically and absolutely the worst rating possible for an online vendor???",1,freelancer.com

Freelancer.com support: I will forward your concern to department X. Me: Your colleague has already done that last week, and 2 other colleagues the weeks before. But I did not get any response whatsoever. Freelancer.com support: Please wait for department X to contact you.

713,"So I did a project and completed it 100% and the employer sent me a payment. 2 days later Freelancer.com reversed the payment, yet they still charged me their cut. So now freelancer.com is charging me to do work. They said the employer violated their terms of services, so what does that have to do with MY MONEY? Nothing. They are scam artists. They don't care about freelancers at all. All they care about is getting their cut.... which they charge you even if you don't get paid, and on top of that I pay freelancer a monthly fee. Total Scam. I am reporting them to BBB. Don't use freelancer.com lets put them out of business!!",1,freelancer.com
714,"I used their services to hire a ""developer"" based in Bangladesh and they charged me for the same milestone twice because they said that they couldn't charge the original CC I gave them. It has been 3 months and my CC hasn't been able to resolve this issue even though I have proof of the double charge and also I was able to make a screen grab from a page on their site where it clearly shows that they were applying a credit on my acct. Needless to say that they didn't and on top of that, they closed my acct. It looks like you can't file a legitimate claim against them or they will close your acct. as punishment. On top of everything else, the so called ""developer"" did on my website was garbage. The site was down for a few hours and it became slower than molasses. There is a reason the developers on that site (mostly form third world countries) are able to be willing to work for less, THEY ARE NOT GOOD!",1,freelancer.com
715,"Again one more stupid reply from freelancer. freelancer holds my bank payment transfer as they are saying my employer told them to hold money. My employer is asking me to complete and go on working without any deposit for milestone 2. So i raise complaint on freelancer regarding the same. see below the stupid reply. i don't know what they are managing for us, when they are not able to solve problem between freelancer and employer . This is the freelancer reply:- Thank you for getting back us.  We do not take any side with regard to the project issue. That is the reason why we contacted you for us to know your explanation on this. We understand that you disagree with some policies on the site, do note that every site has its differences when it comes to particular matter. The site charges project fees for both parties upon acceptance of a project and this has been implemented since the site has started. This is also stated in our Fees and Charges page to let the users aware of this. Indeed, your employer has the obligation to pay you, but as previously mentioned, the project that has been awarded to you is fixed-price; thus, we highly recommend the employers to release the payment after the project completion. If you want to be paid for every completed task, the type of the project should be Hourly and not fixed-price. Let me know what should i do in this case.",1,freelancer.com
716,"They use misleading tactics and figures to get you to spend money, a little here and there. But it adds up. So while they may be legitimate, they make a lot of money from unsuspecting novices hoping to make some money. It's like the banking scam where you round to the nearest dollar and you take the change (have you seen the movie Office Space?). Well, they make a few dollars here and there from millions of freelancers who never get paid (some do, I know). This is a very shady business practice in my opinion. Especially when they advertise these small purchase as if it will help us get awarded. But there are contradictions abound. If you try to downgrade your account, it warns you that it takes about 30 bids before you get awarded (on average). But wait, I thought if I paid 10$ get my bid to the top of the list and to highlight my bid and do all of that other stuff, then my likelihood of getting awarded would be ""very likely"" Well then after 30 bids I should get awarded 10-20 times, right? This also implies that if you pay enough money then you will get awarded, even if you are not the most qualified. That's a poor business model, but it helps them make money (Freelancer that is, not us). From the perspective of the person posting a job, that's not a good mindset either. They should want the most qualified. Or they will hire based on their biases (which is something that freelancer cannot control). It also highly favors older users, or users that have already established a reputation. If someone has 40 reviews, and someone has 0 reviews, who would YOU be more likely to award the project to? Listen freelancer, if a user has 40 reviews and has a 4.5 star rating, how much more likely are they to be awarded than someone who has no reviews? Is it 500%, 1000%, 2000%, 5000%? Yeah, you don't post those kind of figures because you would lose money. If you are new, don't expect to be awarded even 1 out of 30 of your bids. Far far less than that. It's a subtle scam, but it nonetheless a scam. You really charge $5 per test, every attempt? Really? Really? Foreshame, foreshame. It's not that you charge that's the real problem, it's that you lure us into believing that paying the $5 will increase our chances of being awarded by 370%! What a joke. And I don't want to hear from customer service. You are just within a corrupt flawed system, and you will defend because you are part of it. I know, I worked in customer service before. You are paid to resolve complaints. Well, my complaint is with the entire system of freelancer.com and there is nothing you can do to resolve that. It's a systematic issue, and requires fixing at the top. So please refund all of the money I was scammed out of and delete my account. I have sent 3 tickets already and it's been more than 2 weeks without a response. Bravo. Edit after Lara's response: Like I said, the foundation of this company is baseless. Getting rich off the naive dreams of others. It's no different than Craig's List, only you don't have to pay to get work on Craig's list. It's full of just as much smut and junk as Craig's list as well. You say you are just a platform, but that's a big joke. Platform's don't get that rich off of the bottom feeders like me. I'm done wasting my time and money on your site. You should be ashamed (the owners, CEO). Another update, 8/24/2015. Customer service refuses to allow me to contact CEO or manager, or they may just be ignoring my request. This is rather telling of the sort of company they are running. They do not want to take any responsibility or accountability. It's always our fault, or we agreed to this or that, or we did this or that. There's nothing wrong with freelancer at all, it's we who have the problem. At least that's the message I keep getting from customer service --whether its indirect or not.",1,freelancer.com

You may ask for a refund but it is a case to case basis and not all can be refunded. (see attached image) I tried to focus only on joining contest since I can't get any decent jobs. I always pick the guaranteed ones knowing that It is safer but it is not! I got scam by an employer and freelancer cannot do anything about it. The freelancer system got loopholes and it is not safe here anymore!! I made some calculations from day 1 of the contest up to the contest handover where I spend some time to finish the project and after that the money wasn't actually there, freelancer cancelled my withdrawal due to investigation or review on the employer's payment authenticity. I even got a negative balance, what the hell?? They just manipulated my account and fix the problem but I never got the price. For almost 2 months they failed to verify the payment. I asked freelancer support about the verification process but they don't want to share this; to avoid users on abusing the system it's like they just admitted that their system sucks! I suspect that they only verify the employer's payment authenticity after the contest handover is done. Imagine doing all the employers request during the contest and contest handover and after that you'll just gonna find out that you got scammed? Do you think this is fair? They even deleted the contest page where I won. Why?? They offered me a free standard membership for 4 months and told me that they can help? How can that be?? As I've said earlier I already tried this standard membership for 1 year and even switch to lower memberships, didn't any good ones.

Today after 100 applications that we cannot trust we have decided to close our Freelancer account.  Here's why: * Automatic Applications - allows freelancers to automatically apply. Means no one is reading your job spec. Within 5 minutes we had over 40 applications. One of our requirements to applicants was to download our current app and thoroughly review before applying. * No personalised responses - Over 100 applications so far and only 2 were personalised about the job itself (even then they copied and pasted from our job spec) * Fake Profile Images - High percentage of applications had profiles pictures of young asian girls? Extremely bizarre if you are a real developer or company. Quick search in google saw the same images on Ebay shops etc. * Fake feedback - very easy to spot that multiple accounts have been set up giving each other feedback * Too many emails - I have received over 20 emails in my inbox from Freelancer in under 24 hours * Contact outside of Freelancer - 2 applicants contacted our company directly by email to beg us to hire them * Upselling - Have too many emails or applications? Its fine you can pay Freelancer to search through the crap. There should be no crap in the first place. It seems that freelancer encourages spam. * Customer service - Robotic answers. When I emailed to ask why the majority of my applicants had automatic responses and fake images of young asian girls, their response was that they can assure me all applicants go through a verification process. Not really a good answer is it? The above leads me to believe that Freelancer.com really don't care about the quality of their freelancers and only want to make money. As an employer with limited time on my hands I cannot believe they think this business model would work for anyone who is looking to hire. I was looking for serious freelancers and got nothing of the sort. I feel sorry for the genuine developers on this site as employers will not know who is real or not. As a first time experience I would be suggesting to other employers to stay away from the site and not waste your time.  Hopefully freelancer.com take these suggestion on board. My guess though is that a robotic answer will follow.",1,freelancer.com

751,"I joined freelancer.com in 2007. It was then getafreelancer.com and charging just $6 for gold membership. Later they increased few dollars. But everything was free once you pay for that gold membership including payment received. Site was provider friendly.I worked hard and got top 5 rank in provider list.  Then it changed its name and owner and suddenly everything became very costly. Now it has a premium membership for $199.95 per month still you have to pay 3% project fee from every earning. I don't think anybody can earn such a big amount from this site every month because there huge number of bidder in each project and chances of earning good number of project every month is very low. I never won any case against a buyer in freelancer.com though I provided client approval and other proofs. I read a lot about payment reversal and other scam in freelancer.com but never believed these till a morning when I opened my freelancer.com account and found balance - $ 350. Fund of $90 which was in my account also transferred to freelancer.com so total $446 was debited from account. Next day again they changed Indian rupee and AUD to dollar and withdrew $120. So all amount with gone from account and it was still showing balance -$270. When I contacted freelancer support about it they replied that one of my clients who paid to me had some dispute with someone so to recover payment from this client they reversed all payment which he paid to workers including mine. But freelancer.com never informed me that this client had any dispute with someone. I received payment and reviews so everything seems fine for me. I cant check other accounts so how could I knew whether a client had some dispute with others or not. I lost $446 without and fault. Now freelancer .com has stopped my premium membership so I cant bid in more than a 10 projects in a month. They are sending email to deposit money so they could renew membership but I dont know my mistake and reason for this reverse transaction. Here is my chat with freelancer.com support staff-      00:42 Dave S.: It appears that your  employer is experiencing issues with their account.      00:43 Me: but I received  payment through milestone      00:43 Me: and I received  feedback      00:43 Dave S.: You will need to contact your employer regarding the payments for these projects.      00:43 Me: I didnt know about any issue      00:43 Me: but he says that he already paid to me      00:45 Dave S.: Please contact them directly to discuss your payment.      00:45 Dave S.: The funds have been  reversed to their account.      00:46 Me: but my account  which has some indian currency and aud yesterday also changed tousd today      00:47 Me: I dont have balance to renew my membership      00:47 Dave S.: Your INR funds were  converted into USD since your USD funds does not have sufficient funds when the reversal was processed.      00:50 Me: but is it  possible for me to work as general member and earn $250 and deposit it to freelancer.com      00:51 Dave S.: Yes,      00:51 Me: Do you want me to stop working at freelancer.com      00:51 Dave S.: Please contact your  employer directly,      00:52 Me: I am not   satisfied with your reply. I am afraid that it will be repeated  in future      00:53 Me: Fund from my account can be withdraw using any excuse      00:54 Dave S.: You may consult Sections 18-22 of our User Agreement page for an explanation on  this:      00:54 Dave S.:https://www.freelancer.com/about/terms      00:55 Me: Can you help me  to recover payment from this buyer      00:55 Me: He may have  balance in future but he will not pay again      00:56 Dave S.: I can send an email to  your employer.      00:56 Dave S.: However, I cannot   guarantee their quick and positive response.

758,"In two chat sessions with support and more than 2 hours in chat time total we were still unable to come to a resolution of the issue at hand. For some reason my credit card provider would not allow payment of services to Freelancer. I took the next step and attempted to get a Skrill account to handle the payment issue only to find out that because of where I live Skrill wont work with me. Upon reporting this to the staff of Freelancer they stated perhaps I should try another payment gateway service. Now its clear I made multiple attempts to pay for services and they even attested to that, but they were not willing to do whatever it takes to fix the issue. A freelancer had accepted my project and I had tried to pay this person only to fail because of some policy between my card provider and Freelancer. The only solid resolution I could see is that in order to maintain my professional reputation and ensure the freelancer is taken care of is to have bitten the bullet and credit the freelancer on my behalf for the project as it was accepted and they had already begun work on it. Yes that would have cost them but now it will cost them more because I have closed my account and had another 4 to 6 projects with this specific freelancer in the pipeline.

If you have a large capacity of good luck then freelancer.com might be useful for you, and you don't have to be a pro or work hard at all, cause in most cases keep in mind that: 1- the contest holder will pick a design which is opposite to the brief. 2- the CH will pick a stock design or something stolen from previous ideas. 3- the CH will reject your hard work design without any feedback or rating. 4- the CH will pick himself!, by making another account as a designer, and this will give him a lot of logos and concepts for FREE. 5- the winner is picked before the contest ends, and you'll discover this either after announcing the winner and when the contest become unsealed, or while it's running, there was an agreement reached while the poor designers still working hard. 6- you will find cheap designers offering the CH an extra designs like business card or a letterhead and even a full stationary at the private message under their entries (which's actually not private). 7- at some point you'll feel like freelancer.com & contest holders are the masters and you're the slave, when there's a lot of entries, a lot of new modifications, a lot of rejection, a lot of hidden agreements. 8- freelancer.com do not give a damn about the points above ( i made a lot of reports and messaged them on FB). *if you need my advice try to find clients for you own, open your company, or change your field like i did cause this will not make you rich as you thought!... ----------------------------- UPDATE: to Lara",1,freelancer.com

Show Freelancer how it is. Stop using them. They cost time and money and waste time when you try to get any assistance. They are a bunch of fools really.  I hope Visa refuses to issue payments to them once I am done. Stay away, hire a contractor in the end its cheaper. I have yet to get anything done successfully on this site without being nickle and dimmed to the point where it costs more than hiring a firm and the work is inferior to say the least.  I am on the phone with Visa, and they are dragging out the chat. 5 to 10 min between responses. No phone number to call. No accountability. BEWARE. LARA: I am on chat getting a run around. Visa wants to know why you think its ok to take any money without permission. They also a refund is automatic and it should never have shown as a balance in my account. I'm waiting for your support rep in chat while i have Visa on the phone waiting. This has been almost 20 min. Visa is ready to give me a refund and mark you as fraudulent. Review my account all you like, this is just the facts. For the rest of the world here's Henry's answer to where is my refund why is it in my account: ""We understand that you want the funds returned to your bank. The refund case is with our Finance Department already and in the process of having the funds returned from your Freelancer.com account to your credit card. Our Finance Department will contact you directly through Ticket ID: HGT-732-57782. "" Theres not much to refund when its a credit card. And now Visa is saying go ahead and claim the transaction as fraudulent after being made wait in a chat for more than 20 minutes and no reply for the past 10. That is directly from Visa. Do not use this site, if a credit card company says they are an issue clearly they are. Even after telling them I was having the charge reversed by Visa they still give me a run around ""They will directly get your message at Ticket ID: HGT-732-57782. You can send them a message via the ticket or the email thread you received."" This was the response to wanting a phone number for Visa to contact their accounts department. With Visa on the phone with me it took Henry 20 minutes to give me that answer. Again I ask is this someone you want to do business with? I have been writing this review as it happens so you can see for yourself. In the time frame of an hour this is the most response I have received.

774,"Hi. I joined Freelancer about a year ago, and I did that open eyed - means, I read the different opinions of people all over the web. Of course they were mostly negative. (Very few people take the time to think, even less write, about positive experiences. That's, how we apes tick.) Anyway I am a paying member. And before I joined as a premium member, of course I read the TOS. I'm longer in business than most of the people active with web businesses are alive, and I feel better if I know, what's going on. I don't employ at Freelancer, I bid on projects to sell my services. Freelancer is not of special importance for my income, I use the site as a gap filler, but I admit that I had some real fun projects here and met some actually great people. My set of skills is a rather unusual combination, and through Freelancer I have the occasion to do things, I am not required to do for my regular customer base. I have a 5/5 rating for the 24 projects I made, and I had to kick out just one customer who constantly increased his demands up to a not longer acceptable point. So, last week, I made a bid on an offer by one user Dom1000 (posted in lousy German) which translated would read Writing of a Blog Text The bid was 88EUR, I demanded 2 milestones, I got the job and Freelancer cashed their 11.1% I delivered, as agreed, the first half of my work. A couple of hours later the employer contacted me from a second account he had opened hkayso2s and informed me that his original account was blocked by Freelancer. If I understood the scat-German he used right, this was because he issued a cash-back through PayPal, obviously for the only other project he ran through Freelancer. The employer now wanted to use the second account to offer me 44 US-Dollars (remember: is was Euros first...) to pay me the first milestone.  As far as I remember at least when I joined USING FREELANCERs SERVICES WITH MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS FOR THE SAME ENTITY IS A VIOLATION OF THEIR TOS I told him to wait till his original account is either back open or deleted, because I would not work for him until I got my original, first milestone. Because what is an agreement good for, if it is not kept. I also used the FL ticket system to inform them about the case, the multiple accounts, and told them, I want the project to be cancelled WITHOUT A NEGATIVE EFFECT TO MY STATS. My good right, I think, as I was not the one who did not deliver the employer was the one who did not pay as agreed. I even told them, they could keep the 8.80EUR they took from me. I received a canned response, mainly telling me: We are unable to discuss any information regarding your employer's account. I didn't want to discuss any accounts: I wanted the project to be cancelled, remember? During some unwanted chat with the employer, he now offered to pay me outside Freelancer. THIS IS A VIOLATION OF FREELANCERs TOS. He also tried to lure me in additional (probably unpaid?) work and gave me a link to a website, where he and his partner (with a near-east migration background like my original contact) openly offer the delivery of fake scientific work for schools and academical institutions. IN GERMANY, THIS IS A CRIME, and not long ago it costed two German politicians their jobs. So before continuing with discussions with FL and the employer, I took appropriate actions. As of now, I am not allowed to talk about those, I will do so, when I get the green light from the authorities. Again, I wrote to FL, and explained (again) that I want the project to be cancelled. Again, I got a canned text back, containing, if anything, the same information I already had. And Freelancer RE-OPENED THE EMPLOYERS ACCOUNT. This makes me believe, that the service personal either did not have the time to read my eMail, or wasn't able to by other reasons. To the employer I insisted to get my first payment. And he (now, after first accepting the work) wanted additional work to be done to even be able to accept it - two days, after he got the first delivery and liked it. Because the employer saw his prey swim away, they filed a dispute. Again, I wrote to FL, letting them know that I won't accept any negative effects to my reputation. FL made their job easy this time they did not respond. The employer RE.-POSTED THE PROJECT (OF COURSE ONLY THE SECOND HALF, AS HE OBVIOUSLY WANTS TO USE MY WORK FOR THE FIRST HALF GOOD LUCK WITH THIS...) This time, he writes right into the projects headline, Hausarbeit (homework, a term for an academical paper to be done by a student, personally...) to make clear that he not only wants somebody to help him break the law, but also that THIS IS AGAIN A PROJECT WHICH IS ***INVALID***, AS EXPLAINED IN FREELANCERS TOS. So, obviously, an employer requesting criminal activities for Freelancer is more important than a competent freelancer with obvious success and and also obvious very high quality of work.

782,"Sir,   Freelancer is a big and famous website that offers freelancer services to hire for business purposes. I had hired a freelancer to Design a logo for my company. I hired him and had to pay him 1500($25 approx). I selected the payment method as Paypal which was accepted on their website, a receipt was generated for 1500($25 approx) and I paid. After the payment was successful suddenly I realised that 100000($1534.80) were debited from my account instead of 1500($25 approx).  I immediately emailed and chatted with the customer service of Freelancer and they said they will refund, but after 2 days had passed nothing happened. I again contacted them and they said that they have refunded the amount back to my Paypal account and even gave me a receipt for the refund. After another 2 days the balance dint show on my Paypal account, I again contacted Freelancer and they said that the fault is because of the Paypal service. I contacted Paypal and they said that no refund was initiated from Freelancer and if they do have refunded they(Freelancer) have to call Paypal and sort the matter. I told the incident to Freelancer and they then agreed that they had held up my payment and wont give it back until I called Paypal and tell them that I dont want a refund as it makes 'matter complicated'. I called Paypal again letting them know that Freelancer wants to me close the dispute. Paypal strictly advised not to close the dispute as then refunding my money will be next to impossible.  I have till now mailed Freelancer over 25 times and every time they blackmail me by saying closed the dispute and then we will see how much and when to refund. I gave them a warning that Ill go to court and still they dint agree, after I was adamant that I will not close the dispute and will move to court, they are now for over 4 days keep replying me the message saying that my case has been transferred to another department and I will hear from them within 48hours. Its been many days now and since the start I have been jumping from talking to their department to department (chat, refund, Verification, billing and more).  Freelancer has now even limited my account and are threatening to block it and not refund the money at all. After searching on the net I found thousands of other similar cases where Freelancer debits money or doesnt refund the left balance of a customer back to them. Freelancer even agreed to the mistake of by fault debiting $1500 instead of 1500, but isnt refunding.  Iam a very small man compared to this billion dollar company and I dont know what to do. These guys dont have any phone number\email of management\Address in my country. Please help me, I can provide with any proof you like. I even have saved all the chats and emails.

I had just joined the website a few days ago merely not more than 3 and posted for a freelancer. I did not award or do anything.  I have never been so nervous about a website before after reading these reviews and what I can say, that if a website will make you feel this way, it might not be worth using and dealing with the headache.  There is a saying when I'm from says, ""once bitten, twice shy"" and it means when you got caught in a bad dealing the first time, never make it happen a second.

786,"Hello, I've been working as a freelancer since 2011, and the first website I've used was VWorker (that was bought by Freelancer). VWorker was like 1000 times better. They would take care of their users by holding the money until the job was done, and if the freelancer delivered, and the employer was happy, the money was released. But with Freelancer, that's another story. You don't have any kind of security that you will get paid for your job. I did a small project for 100$. Freelacer withdraw from my balance 25$, because I've accepted the project. I did the job, deliver it, but the employer did not paid me. In fact he just ignored me. I've tried to talk with someone from Freelancer, because I don't think it was normal for me to pay the acceptance fee, for a project I was not paid for. But nothing! So bottom line is that I've PAID 254 do work for free! Also, they have a habbit of withdrawing money from your paypal balance, and if you don't have money in your paypal balance, they will charge your credit card that is linked to your paypal accout, so you might want to cancel your Preapproved payments to Freelancer from your paypal account.

788,"Hi All,  Of all the tech services I've used online Freelancer.com has by far the worst customer service. Here is why: I put on a bid, and then spent 1 week to do due diligence on all the bids. I then find a decent freelancer, and when I try to pay the milestone their checkout system fails. This has happened 4-5 times earlier, and after a couple of emails front and back they can normally resolve it. This is not ideal, but I find it okay for a growing tech company.  Just after I solved the payment issue they closed my account without warning, and without any reason. I send them an email, and this is what I get back.:  ""Thank you for contacting our Support Desk. Your account has been closed by Freelancer.com administrator. We offer no recourse or rebuttal for this penalty. It is stated in our Terms & Conditions that Freelancer.com may terminate the participation of a user if we think that they are creating problems, legal liabilities (actual or potential), infringing someone else's intellectual property rights, engaging in fraudulent, immoral or illegal activities, or for other similar reasons. See the Section 23 of the Terms & Conditions for your reference. To view our Terms and Conditions, you may visit this link: - User Agreement for Freelancer.com http://www.freelancer.com/page.php?p=info/terms"" As most people can tell this is just copy pasted to everyone that asked why their account is closed down. I sent another email and I get the same copy pasted answer again.  I decide to create a new account, and repost the project. After 3 days, they close my new account. Again, without any reason. I send them a 1,5 page email to understand what I'm doing wrong, and I get this back:  ""Thank you for contacting Freelancer.com Support. We appreciate your feedback regarding our website and support. However, the closure of your account is due to the violation of our Terms and Conditions. Having said this, the option for us to lift the account closure is not available anymore."" This time, it's not a completely copy and pasted answer, but still another wage confusing answer. I find the last sentence interesting since I wrote them an email a couple of minutes after they canceled my account.  Since they cancel accounts left, and right without reason, and don't treat their customers with any respect, I'd recommend anyone reading this to use other services such as odesk.com, and elance.com. I find freelancer.com a great example of a tech company that is growing too fast, and completely neglected the quality of their customer support.",1,freelancer.com
789,"Having used this website both to do freelance work and to get work done, here's what I have to say: They don't charge anything for posting a gig there, and do not vet what gets posted so all kind of crap appears there daily. Roughly 90% of projects are just noise ranging from ""develop a clone of amazon.com, budget $30"" to solicitation of prostitution. If you're willing to wade through this pile of rubbish to find what appear to be real projects you'll quickly find at least half of them are either 1. Run by a scammer or 2. A fake, in all likelihood posted by freelancer.con itself. Projects run by a scammer are real, in the sense you'll have to do real work. Sadly you'll never see a cent from them. Beware! This website is scammer central, plenty will award you a project, just to revert charges after completion or just paying a small milestone and leaving the projects open indefinitely, cheating you out of most of your money. In either case freelancer.con won't do a thing to help recover your money. Just read how many cases are documented in this review website alone. This kind of thing happens every single day there, and no matter how careful you are sooner or later you'll get bitten. Some of the scammers are amateurs trying their first hustle, others are professional criminal networks that have been doing for years. And some seem to be in cahoots with freelancer.con themselves. Fake projects are there just to make the website look more attractive and enticing new users to sign-up. When you apply to them you'll never hear back from the poster and the projects will eventually expire and close themselves. They are only there to make it look like freelancer.con has good gigs up for grabs. Not so! I'm willing to bet this company has an offshore team of people posting fake projects 24/7. If you spend enough time on their website you'll start noticing the patterns. So are there any legit projects on freelancer.con? Yes, they exist. I've done a few and I've got paid for them. I've also posted gigs there, paid fairly and got rave reviews for doing so. You can find gigs there on a daily basis, unfortunately most are paid at rates than make even Asian sweatshops cringe in disgust. From time to time real projects, run by honest people and with realistic budgets get posted. Been there, done that. Sadly, they generally get spammed to death by the aforementioned Asian sweatshops driving the poster away, usually to never go back. Just banning India, Pakistan and Bangladesh would probably cut 90% of the issues with this site. Ban also Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Thailand and China and you cut 99% of the troublemakers. If you're looking for work just look for projects originating from first world countries, same thing if you're looking for freelancers although I would also consider Eastern European and South Americans, I've had nothing but positive experiences with the latter. Beware, though. Some crafty ones have proxies and verified identities in countries such as the UK, the US or Canada to fly under the radar. As many others before me, I've been overcharged by freelancer.con, scammed out of project fees, and have had my withdrawal requests cancelled. Fortunately when that happened I was still in contact with the company that posted the project, which is run by a pretty cool guy, and he said his account had been suspended and showed a negative balance. They literally emptied their PayPal account with their hidden fees. This was on a project I was being paid £600 (minus 10% freelancer.con cut) and they had over £750 in their account at the time and still owed them money. Furthermore they demanded a huge amount of documentation ranging from passport scans to public utility bills to prove their identity, things that are against the law in all EU countries, but apparently are tolerated in Australia. Needless to say, they didn't want to keep doing business with freelancer.con. On the other hand, we have continued doing business together, they pay directly to me and we both couldn't be any happier. Although I never got paid for the first gig, freelancer.con pocketed £750. Online freelancing sites are a race to the bottom, and freelancer.con has won the race hands down.",1,freelancer.com

I withdrew the money from my account to bank account. I got my money in my hand. The problem started after 7 days after withdrawing the amount, when i logged in my account i was surprised to see my account as limited, wrote atleast 10 mails to support, three mail where replied with lame and stupid replies like we understand your problem etc etc, after that verification team asked docs for verification i gave and got verified for 4 days this verification continued, then today when i logged in and saw another surprise, my funds showed -$180 ( $20 was project fee that i was refunded, total project was of $200), on seeing dashboard i see that project got deleted, how does that matter if a completed project is deleted?? How can a person with sense and brain charge money for the project that was deleted after it was completed and whose payment was completed. I am a serious and professional programmer, cannot accept this foolishness. If you people look at my problem it is a total scam website, even if the project is deleted for some problem in employer then freelancer.com should bear the charges because i accepted the project from a 100% verified employer, guys do not waste on this scam website, i faced many other issues on this website that i did not mention here, so i will say that freelancer will have to bear all the charges of any mistake of employer or site administrator.",1,freelancer.com

I was happy that i will be able to pay my bills as it was my month ending, but after 2 or 3 days when i logged into my account i was suprised to see nearly -$180 in my account, after contacting the support they told me that employer did not verify his account so they send back money to his credit and i need to full fill the negative balance with the project fee i.e -$200. What the hell did i work for nearly 15 days so after withdrawing the amount i will need to work to full fill the negative balance, just can't these people allow employer to create project once they verify everything.

I am still using this site a bit, but i am totally unsatisfied with the service, so be carefull if you are planing to make this site as your major source of income.

I find the freelancers on the site are conners and beggers the task I gave was two very simple tasks all could be solved with CSS, not really worth the $30 work, many where asking for $50+ to do one line of CSS complaining that the work would be complex and hard, even though the solution was one line. Freelancer them selves are theives, hidden fees everwhere, you award a freelancer for work, pay us. You release a milestone, pay us. You start challenge, pay us. You delete a project, pay us. all of this is without notice and automatic making you easily lose a lot of money on a single project. Not worth a single penny and I can assure you after this I will never use my account again lets hope closing an account does not cost anything.

The support: I just got done talking to freelancer support for about 30 minutes. In this 30 minutes the live chat person answered maybe 2 of my 15+ questions, and blatently ignored all the others. I asked questions about why my money was being held. I was told (after maybe 15 minutes of asking) that your first withdraw takes 15 days to process for security reasons. I than asked what security reasons and got no response even when I asked multiple times. I asked the person if I could speak to their supervisor, and again this question was ignored. I asked if they would be mad if they didn't get money they were expecting to get for an entire month after initially withdrawing it? Again, no response. I asked where I could rate them and they told me a rating survey would appear when I exited the conversation. Well, I did this and there was no rating survey. It was probably the worst live chat experience I've ever had in my life. I am not going to leave my username below because this horrible company will probably just screw me over again and again.

821,"Any one not understanding what's going on on Freelancer.com Read the posts here. All is true. Benni25 Mauritius Translator Translation Freelancer.com https://www.freelancer.com/u/benni25.html  The freelancer or company under the above mentioned link conducts poor business practices which I can confirm as a victim. I was contacted by this individual (i don't think it is a company) on oDesk.com They said they were a translation company looking for staff. They asked for a test of almost 900 words which is unusual. Translation companies normally would ask for a test for less than 400 words. When i refused, ""benni25"" said they would pay for that test. I accepted believing in his good faith. He said it would only take a few hours to review the test as he already had that text test translated. I delivered the text and the next day he contacted me again. I thought it was to concrete my payment. Surprisingly he asked for another test. I asked whether he had the results of the first test. He said NO. I told him I would prefer to wait for the results of the first test, get my payment and then proceed with the second test which he would also pay for. As per this unusual approach i decided to investigate. I contacted Mr. Klaus Deschka at VinPilot.com who resulted to be a client of ""benni25"". I sent my translation to Mr. Deschka who confirmed that my text was exactly the text he received from benni25. He has paid aprox. USD20 for that text. I had agreed with ""benni25"" USD 34,36.  With this evidence, I confronted Benni25 who immediately put down his web site www.bennitranslationservices.com and the email addresses he had used to contact me: odesk@bennitranslationservices.com and accountsdpt@bennitranslations.com. DUMP was my first conclusion. I understood in that moment how some freelancers are able to offer ridiculous rates for a translation. I decided to contact many of the clients of benni25 on freelancer.com. All of them had realized with the time that benni25 has delivered them very poor translations and that they had to have those translation redone increasing theirs costs. I can mention xtblue (writers for right) in Pensacola, Usa, Steve Coy at TotoIt Group, a freelance translator Jan Krister and many others. I reported Benni25's profile to the Freelance.com administration with no results. They were blind regading this unscrupulous behivaiour even though i provided the testimonials of his clients on that site. How can Freelancer.com allow such individual to mislead clients and other freelancers? How can Freelancer.com allow an individual to dump prices to compete in advantage with honest and professional freelancers? How can Freelancer.com allow this individual to keep delivering translations and some other assignments with a doubtful quality affecting the corporative image of the clients using his services? This is really sad. Please visit http://www.propertytailoredmanagement.info/benni-translation-services/ for more details on this issue. Should you be a freelancer.com freelance professional of company hiring services and you have been victimized by benni25 please address to the site administration. Perhaps they need to collect 100 testimonials before proceeding with justice. https://www.freelancer.com/u/benni25.html",1,freelancer.com
822,"At first look, the bidding system seemed ridiculous as people bid such low amounts from India, Pakistan etc. that I don't know how anybody remotely good at their job gets a look in! Also - paying for the tests?? You have to pay to answer 40 questions in 15 minutes that you haven't been prepped for. I bid for a virtual assistant job, 'company' had good reviews and had used Freelancer for a few years so thought i'd give it a go. Next day, get an email to contact the guy via Skype to discuss the role...upon getting on Skype it wasn't the role he had advertised but wanted me to write a 1000 word essay on South East Asian education for around $20. I politely declined and he then suggested another role, being in a YouTube video for his clothing brand. It seemed (semi) legit but I was not too keen, he persisted and asked to see some non-revealing clothes from my wardrobe so I could wear them in his video. Ok....I (stupidly) showed him, on the hanger, a buttoned up shirt. This was not good enough, he then requested I took my clothes off (on camera) to show him, upon saying no he then asked me if I had any strapless top's or a mini skirt to wear. I felt extremely uncomfortable and said so - I kept trying to politely end the conversation so he would go away but he then proceeded to tell me to take my cardigan off and stand away from the camera so he could see all of me. At this point I cancelled the call and went straight to Freelancer to report him - whilst he continually harassed me on Skype. I have not heard anything from Freelancer in regards to this, my partner also wrote an email to them and has not heard anything. I am not going to be the first female this has happened to but I feel they could respond to mine and my partners (several) messages.

So were so frustrated, that we paused till 2014, when we saw that freelancer deduced from our account every month 10 USD dormant fee. But the worst thing: they have stolen all our resting money of 960 USD from our account. We have contracted a webdesigner from Mexico (we are also from Mexico) trough freelancer.com and released this 960 USD to him to realize a webproject for us. But Freelancer only paid 35 USD to him and all the rest of 925 USD is blocked and we cannot get it!!!!

They themselves are doing all this, As every thing is in their hands and they can transfer the funds back, so this is why they will pay you upfront and on the next day they will reverse their payment and you will loose your payment. For such cases, if you will only receive and don't pay to the poster's skrill, even then they will earn, how?... As when you will accept the project, they will charge you 10% upfront, user will pay you and on the next day they will reverse that payment, but will never reverse the transaction on which they have charged you!!!!

Sitejabber has just told me how helpful my review was, what a good reaction....yet when I look at the ""Freelancer"" site, 1000's of 5 star short testimonials!!!....but then I look at how many 5 stars on consecutive days, especially September 2018! WOW....talk about ""Fake News""! Does anyone actually check the origin of some of this rubbish?",1,freelancer.com
847,"I just became a new user to this site and was lucky enough to score a job on my first day for 550$ USD. Freelancer made me owe them 55$ USD which is fine to get a percentage of the business.  Problem is when you do the job and the client decides to takes off on the project entirely before paying or even viewing your work, Freelancer.com still wants there money. I suggest staying far away from this Indian bot flooded marketplace and take your chances with craigslist or whatever local classifieds website that's in your area.",1,freelancer.com
848,"I've been on the site for many years and sadly their services are going downhill. They seem more interested in making money than on providing a good user experience. They seem more keen on attracting new members with an increasingly flashy interface, rather than retaining loyal members who have been with them from the very beginning.  I would not recommend this site to my worst enemy. I am already looking at other alternative Freelancing sites to sign up on.",1,freelancer.com
849,"If i could i would give 0 ratings, I saw earlier post by guy saying ""RUN AWAY"" Thats true, site is full of indian-bangladesh scammers, you pay get nothing in return, Freelancer support doesnt do a thing about it, they just take money. One advice : RUN AWAY!",1,freelancer.com
850,"Avoid this site at all costs. I hired a freelancer who said they were scammed by not receiving money up front, so now they always ask for pre - payment. Turns out they're the scammer, no work done, and the company does not protect its customers at all. RUN AWAY!!",1,freelancer.com
851,"I successfully bid on work and carried it out to the project owners satisfaction which I was promptly for. I withdrew the funds and thought nothing more of it. A couple of days after the money got to my Paypal account I logged in to Freelancer, only to find that I had a negative balance ! It turns out that a payment made to the project manager had been reversed by Freelancer. As the payment had been used to pay me, the payment to me was also reversed, putting my account into overdraft by about USD250. Freelancer suspend any account that is in negative, if I want to use my Freelancer account now I have to pay them around USD250 so they will lift the suspension. I have tried more than once to appeal to their common sense, but they only see the dollar signs.",1,freelancer.com

854,"OK, i have used freelancer a few times and have been ripped off by a number of freelancers on here. First time i wanted a redevelopment of my website, he did it but i was unhappy with the progress so i pulled out and paid him for his time and apologised. He hacked my server and took my existing website off line and changed all the passwords. Managed to get it back online eventually,. Second another freelancer, for the same website redevelopment kept demanding extra money, the work was shabby so i pulled out as it was costing me a fortune all these hidden costs. The work was slow and did not listen to what i wanted. Took over 3000 gbp from me, i complained and freelancer did absolutely nothing about it. So, months later i decided ok il give it another go and advertised my website again for redevelopment. Chose one guy and all seemed good and he understood. I payed him half and the rest on completion. Did not hear from the guy for weeks and messages ignored. I set up a dispute and was awarded half of the money back. I have received nothing from the guy in terms of work and took my money.. over 1000 usd... wtf? I have complained to freelancer and waiting for a reply. I feel robbed and used again. Im staying clear of this website from now on, they all want to take your money. Be warned stay the hell away!",1,freelancer.com

Freelancer.com wanted me to actually pay them a small amount of money to resolve this issue. Note that the task cost was $25. I gave $10 upfront and Freelancer.com charged me another $3 as a fee for the job( !? ) WTF?? In total I was charged $13 and my task is not completed yet.

It happened after around 14 days of project completion and even Feedback was also provided . All money was taken back from my account. I lost the Project Fee as well in this case. 2. I was awarded a project by a client and Project fee was taken from my account, but then client became unresponsive, and I have not received any reply from them for around 10 days now. Here again, I have lost the project award fee. FL reversed the payment which has been made to my Account, and It was my money and without my consent, it was taken out, that is really great.

Their fees are to the point of ridiculous (another site that we use charges a FLAT RATE OF $6.95 PER MONTH and there's no draconian escrow system - how you get paid is between YOU and the CLIENT, like grown ups.) and they keep going up, and the hoops you have to jump through FOR EVERYTHING is even more ridiculous. I spend more time explaining to clients HOW to make and release payments through them than I do actually working.  Now in the last couple of months, as if their fees and hoops aren't bad enough, they've decided freelancers can't ask for their initial milestone deposits (our initial milestones are a 33% deposit to cover things like software we have to buy for the client up front) to be released up front, they have to leave them in escrow. So, basically if the client stalls the project - we're out of pocket.  Their latest control freak trip - is they're complaining about everybody's profile pic/logo - and threatening to terminate our accounts if we don't ""upgrade"" our look.

After 4 months they reverse the payment if an employee I paid for their hard work. How does this work after an account has been closed. I did not request for this to be done and I saw in one of the complaints below that a Freelancer employee is claiming that the employer requested it. Now this is one big LIE. I wonder why will they reverse a payment when it was not requested by the employer. And if the account of the employer is closed where does this money goes. Does it just devolve to matter?

874,"Working on Freelancer is like dealing with the devil. You sign up, fill out your skills, bid on some projects, make some money, and everything seems great. But it's not until you start using it that you find out how they take advantage of you.  I've been using it now for a couple of years, and while the site's front-end design has gotten snazzier, the service has gotten more and more exploitative. Firstly, whenever you win and accept a project, YOU the freelancer, have to pay Freelancer.com's share of the commission UPFRONT. That fee is immediately taken out of whatever payment method you've linked to your account, rather than more reasonable sites do by taking the money out of what you get paid when it's paid.  What's more, those fees a NONREFUNDABLE. Meaning, if the employer has you accept the project, and then they cancel for some reason, even if it has absolutely nothing to do with you, you aren't entitled to a refund. I spoke to them and managed to get a refund when this happened to me once, but I suspect it's not something that's designed to happen regularly.  Currency conversion--Freelancer ROUTINELY gives me around 5% less for currency conversions than I can get by transferring the money to PayPal and then having them convert it. Really sleazy. Freelancer makes it painful to get your money out once you've gotten paid. Withdrawals only happen twice per week, rather than on-demand. You can submit a withdrawal request, but it won't be fulfilled for several days. They actually recommend that you keep as much money as possible on your Freelancer.com balance as possible, to make it ""convenient"" to pay project fees when they are awarded to you. Yeah, no. When you carry the money as a balance on the site, they keep it in their bank where it earns interest. Finally, just to show how much contempt they have for their freelancers, Freelancer.com has this incredibly stupid ""experience point"" system put in place. You earn ""experience points"" just like in a video game, and these experience points translate into levels, and gaining levels allows you to unlock more features on the site. They even have little graphic symbols for these various actions, just like a real-life MMORPG.  Seriously, find work through someone else. I'm finding much better prices and fairer workloads on other sites.",1,freelancer.com

879,"Only at Freelancer.com Providers bidding on projects, Almost all providers hire boys to do bidding on their behalf, these boys job is to copy a pre written text and posted on as a bid on every project. If you ever see any one of these bidders online try to ask him any technical question, you will see that either he will logout or will not answer you or will talk to you but will try to change the topic in anyway, and that is why because he does not know anything his job is just to copy some text and paste it in the bid. We have made a test you too can try it, we posted insult to someone, the title was just insult and the project description also, the funny thing that in seconds there was many bids, also they mentioned in their bid descriptions: we studied your requirement we .. try it yourself its fun. We knew that Freelancer reached its 1 million members, a year a go that is after over 15 years of existence, now in one year they reached 13.5 millions that increment 12.5 millions in about a year time, these figures for sure are correct but how? Because Every provider create 3 to 5 different ids, and why they are doing that? They bid with all these ids on each project means on one project they very same person will have 5 different bid with 5 different names ids and of course with 5 different bid amounts, they do this to increase their chances to win a project. Also they do this to give their selves reviews . So when you post a project if you see 50 bids do not be surprise if they are actually just 10 bidders, but each one has made a bid from 5 different ids. Providers Reviews: Every providers create about 5 different ids, then they use some of them to post project with a minimum value, which he win it from his other id and give to himself a review, with 5 ids he can guarantee himself lots of reviews that look like they are from different people. Bidders morals and behaviors: If you talk or ask any question to any bidder, then say sorry you are not fit for my job, or you stop talking to him, he will shower you with insults. Its like you talk to me you must hire me. The end result is Freelancer.com is the worst place ever for anyone wants to get his job done. their true name is ScamLancers, and the bidders to beggars, and the providers to brokers, Because who bids and who talk to you is brokering the work, and has no idea about what you are talking about.",1,freelancer.com

In over 40 years I HAVE NEVER HAD A WORSE EXPERIENCE THAN THAT INFLICTED ON OUR FIRM BY FREELANCER.com. At first I was pleased because of the quality of the work by the artist selected for our project. Then the unauthorized charges started hitting our account.  I notified PayPal, they are very legitimate, and they worked with us to get at least a partial refund. There were over $900 in unauthorized charges when I filed a dispute. The minute the dispute was filed our account with Freelancer was ""limited."" That led to a cut off in communication with the artist. The project (which was time sensitive) ground to a halt.  The damage is done. We will never be able to complete the project by the Christmas season. And we LOVED THE ARTIST's WORK. We may have lost $thousands, and in good conscience we will honor our commitment to that artist which will cost even more; but the least we can do is warn you that our experience was horrendous!

Further update on 27th March, 2015 Freelancer didn't refund me any fees as I mentioned above based on logic that I might have given project files to the client and I just checked with the client he is still unable to find suitable developer. The whole dispute was wrong, client didn't like the design later and started dispute, although he approved the design initially.

It's reason may be various: policies, bidding structure, arbitration, support etc... A lot of people chose vWorker and vWorker really had it's own culture of freelancing. Once freelancer.com acquired any other already running business, they SHOULD respect the other culture which directly affects thousands of people. One simple example, I have tons of successfully completed projects and I kept hidden the information about project prices. I have my own reasons to keep it hidden. What happened in freelancer.com? All of my projects' prices are now public and support service says it's impossible to hide them. If they are not supporting old work culture of vWorker, why did they acquire it?

891,"After many years on freelancer.com they way they do business has changed. They currently stole over $450+ from my account and other freelancers who had worked for me. Blaming it on a chargeback that never went through. Freelancer just kept the money. I hired someone to do some work they didn't do anything and were ill qualified. I went to go file a dispute and their system asked ""how much do you want to pay the freelancer?"" I entered $0 and it told me I must enter a value less then 100%, so they forced me to not enter in a full dispute amount. I entred $1 their system gave me $1 and sent $86 to the freelancer. I then contacted freelancer.com and the freelancer neither one of them would give me my money back after a purposeful deceptive dispute process had tricked me and robbed me of the money. I then field a paypal chargeback at that time freelancer.com deducted $86 from my account and $105 from a milestone I had in escrow for another user. I lost the paypal chargeback and they didnt reflect the money back into my account at this point I had lost $190 and freelancer employess continually put my account at $0 while taking escrow in and prior payment made to other freelancer directly from the freelancers. They never returned the money to me or the freelancers. All in all at the end I had lost $450 directly from freelancer.com accounting employees manually manipulating and altering my account balance data in addition to that I had 2 duplicate charges from thier system on a deposit that was caught later puting a chargeback on that resulted in the same accounting system flaws and theft behavior towards its freelancers and its custoemers that happend prior. At this time freelancer.com owes me $450 , they will not respond to my tickets in their system. They are blatan criminals the evidence is solid and Im filing a police report against them in their home town. This company should be removed from the face of the internet, they are a deceptive, criminal organization filed with fraud. Do not do business with this company. Its the company that is the thieves not the freelancers.",1,freelancer.com

900,Incredibly stupid. Asks me to choose computer skills which I do not have. No other option. Complete waste of time!!,1,freelancer.com
901,"FREELANCER.com is Dangerous - Terms/Requirements change at a moments notice in order to keep your money. I am a Doctoral Student. After I did my first project, I terminated the agreement I had between PayPal and Freelancer. What Freelancer does not tell you is that they will hit your PayPal account with a ""Project Fee"" after the client has paid the money (which includes the project fee) into the Freelancer's ""Escrow Account."" So Freelancer.com now controls all of the money in the Freelancer's Escrow account, and has removed ten percent of the project fees from his or her PayPal account. And that fact is not made known to the customer from the beginning. That is never disclosed to the Freelancer.    When I contacted customer service with Freelancer, they told me not to worry, future funds would be deducted from the escrow account on Freelancer - but they failed to tell me why the ""project fee"" from the client would be removed from my PayPal if the fee was already in Escrow. Freelancer.com is scammy, because they take all of the money for your project and lock it down for two weeks (in the beginning) AND charge you the 10% project fee. So for the first two to three weeks, you lose all of your time, you lose 10% of the project(s) value from your PayPal - and when you want to take out your money (transfer to PayPal) you are hit with secondary and tertiary requirements which were NOT part of the original agreement. Since I had money in my Freelancer Escrow account to cover any future projects, I cancelled the PayPal agreement with them - for protection. But then you lose your ""verified"" status - and until Freelancer ""verifies"" you, they keep your money. WHAT IS VERIFICATION? ALMOST EVERY PIECE OF PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION YOU OWN.  Freelancer.com asks for enough information to commit identity theft in your name. My Bank, the local Law Enforcement and my attorney all said ""THIS IS NOT VERIFICATION, THIS IS AN IDENTITY HARVESTING TECHNIQUE."" So now I have $500 locked down in escrow, another $375 inbound - which I cancelled, and I am out more than a week of work. As soon as you get your first project - they will nail your PayPal account for the 10% Fee. If you terminate the PayPal agreement with Freelancer - even though they can still deposit your funds - you go through another process which will ask you for just about every single personal identity feature you have: Current photos of you, scans of ID with birthdate, national identity numbers and addresses visible. Utility bills and bank statements are also requested. The manager at my bank in the US said ""This is a joke. Who do these people think they are fooling - this goes far beyond identity verification."" He told me that Freelancer would have enough information to remove money from my bank account within a matter of minutes. And if you read the stories on the internet - many people have had their bank account hit by Freelancer - and the same goes with PayPal.  **CAVEAT EMPTOR**  FREELANCER.COM Recognize that while you think you are giving your PayPal or Bank Account number to Freelancer for verification, they are going to include all of your personal information as part of your ""user agreement"" with them.  They are going to claim that you submitting all of your personal information substantiates the fact that you entered an agreement with them to remove money from your Bank Account and/or PayPal Account. This is not disclosed in to new Freelancers. If you think you are going to cancel your PayPal ""agreement"" with them (whether you knew you ""agreed"" or not) and still have them deposit the money they owe you - Forget it. Whatever you have earned and have in escrow (a fancy name for your hard-earned money which they are holding from you) - will not be deposited into your PayPal account until you give them ALL of your personal information (which includes all of the info needed to now start nailing your bank account for how much ever they want. And this is where the dilemma arises. Do you give them all of your valuable ID (some of which your bank does not even have) in order to get your ""funds"" released from Freelancer ""escrow?"" The other thing is that they will accept money for a project from an unverified employer. You accept the project, they hit your PayPal account for 10% if they can - and you will never receive a penny - until the unverified employer verifies himself.  So while it is okay for Freelancer.com to charge your PayPal account 10% for the work you do, and it is okay for them to take money from an ""unverified"" employer and hold it in your ""escrow (LOL),"" they will never release the funds to you from an ""unverified"" employer - the funds are held for ""security"" issues. So while Freelancer feels ""secure"" enough to take money from unverified employers and to charge your PayPal account 10% for the ""project fee"" for the unverified employer, you will never see a penny of that money unless the employer self-verifies. If you contact customer service (after Freelancer has charged your PayPal 10%) they will claim that the problem needs to be resolved between the unverified employer and you - the Freelancer. And all the while they have the money you earned - plus the 10% they removed from your PayPal account. If the employer does not self-verify - you lose the money you earned - plus the 10% Project Fee and all of the time you put into completing the project. In the US we call this ""Bait and Switch."" Freelancer.com changes the terms of service (or hides them from the Freelancers) once money has been received. If Freelancer ran their business the way it looks on the surface, it would be awesome. Freelancer.com has their system set up to make the inflow of money very easy, but forget about taking the money out of your Freelancer.com ""escrow"" without giving them every single personal identity detail about yourself. As a world traveler - their ""verification"" requirements constitute a huge security risk to me. Photos of myself, holding my ID, scans of my ID's and photocopies of my bank statements? E-Bay and PayPal have a pretty efficient verification system. But it appears that Freelancer.com waits until your ""escrow"" account is built up with them, and then they hit you with additional requirements to get the money you earned (while it generates interest for them). And those requirements are so detailed that the average person will forgo receiving their hard-earned money in order to maintain some level of privacy with their personal information. Freelancer.com is very well set up and thought out - for the Freelancer executives who want to get ahold of your hard-earned money. It looks great at the beginning, but good luck retrieving any of the money you made while simultaneously preserving the security of your personal information. In a way it is like blackmail. Freelancer basically says ""give us all of your personal information or we keep your money."" Freelancer just set up shop in Canada - so hopefully Canadian authorities will look into this b/c Bait and Switch with TOS is illegal in North America. There is no disclosure with Freelancer.com. The true TOS emerges when they have the funds from a few of your projects tucked neatly into your ""escrow"" account. When you log into your Freelancer account, look at the balance at the top of your Profile Page. That amount in ""escrow"" is really the amount of money you lost for doing those projects (in addition to the 10%). UPDATE: August 10 - I filed complaints with scamwatch of Australia and IC3.gov in the USA. This company has just opened a branch in SW Canada and are now under jurisdiction of Canadian Law. The way Freelancer.com changed their TOS with Freelance workers AFTER funds have been deposited in their accounts is against US and Canadian Law.",1,freelancer.com
902,Is there any Negative star i can give ? coz they don't even deserve 1 star to be honest. i am extremely disappointed by the process of this website. i have worked so hard and worked on a project for 1052$. Client was very happy with the project and gave me positive feedback with 5 ratings. Now when i tried to withdraw my earned funds i got message from support that there is an issue with my client's account so that withdrawal can not be processed. Are you kidding me ? is that my responsibility to check all the accounts of my client before go into a project with him? Or why support didn't intimate me when i was working on this project for weeks? why they only intimate me when i delivered all the source files to my client.? Now that client is not replying to my messages and i am here with this Poor POOR POOR support system they containing with them.. Everytime a new person reply to my same concern with his or her own philosophy and that person having few knowledge about my concern.. Some pre-written sentences copy pasted by support.. that's really painful and frustrating.. Seriously thinking of leaving this website.. That is not my duty to verify or resolve the issues of my client.. that's support's duty that why the charged us heavy fees and commissions.  I am not going to be silent if i did not get my withdrawal.. i didn't worked so hard on my profile to face such situations.,1,freelancer.com

904,"Terrible site. I joined hoping it would be better than Elance, but it's possibly worse. Bottom-of-the-barrel job prices, you have to pay to do skills testing, and if you want to bid on jobs within more than one category, you need to pay for that 'privilege.' They obviously don't care about attracting or retaining professionals because of the awfulness of the jobs posted.  Freelancer isn't concerned with providing safe, secured, reputable employment to professionals at all. Instead, they only care about scraping their percentage off of the millions of poor-paying jobs that do go through their site. Like ""$20 for writing 150 300-word articles. If I don't like your writing, I fire you."" Uhh, gee. What a great working environment! Don't you want to pay for the privilege of bidding on that fruitful opportunity? There are so many unserious clients looking to pay nothing for professional-level work and so many people who are asking for spec work, and from what I know about the site, Freelancer does nothing to deter this. After I signed up, I immediately started receiving emails almost hourly from them and because this was annoying, I wanted to change my email settings, but Freelancer doesn't let you do this unless you verify your phone number. I didn't want to give them my phone number so I emailed them, and they pressed for my phone number. I said I now wanted to cancel my account. Guess what? You can't! There is no way to delete my account and after multiple emails to freelancer staff, they are still refusing to do so, and telling me that they'll ""keep it open in case you want to return.""  It's an unprofessional site that wastes your time and money. Avoid.",1,freelancer.com
905,"Since one year I was registered on this site that allows you to earn with a pay per project system. This website (www.freelancer.com) is managed by such a Matt Barrie, Australian entrepreneur. At the end of a project, the employee receives the money in his account, less a percentage retained on the site. I made in a year and a half 3 projects in my spare time, for a total of 710$ dollars and with the 3rd project I got the possibility to withdraw the money (lower limit is 500$). First withdrawal request was delayed of 15 days by default and was canceled. Before making the second request I asked precise details to freelancer because I wanted to use the wire transfer. After I sent the request freelancer found a reason to cancel it: missing informations. When I sent all informations correctly my account has been limited due to 'security reason', for 'antiterrorism' and 'anti-money laundering' fraud. It required me to pass a security document review process.Procedure was suspected, because for sending money on the platform there is no verification. Money come in easily but does not come out from the platform. In full confidence, I have uploaded the scan of ID card, copy of the contract with my bank to proof my address, a photo of me with the identity card in my hand in high resolution and I also answered to a question: why I connect from a different location respect to my address written on the document: Simply, I'm in vacation, and I use a different connection. After a few hours I received an email inviting me to send further informations, as well as the information of my profile have to march with my profile (they match, just Country is different due to my old mobile number), a coloured copy of the bank contract (the bank is online and they sent to me just a black and white copy, they can't do more). I'm a student and I do not have any bills with my name and address, I live with my parents. They asked me why I'm connecting with proxy or VPS, they want another hi-res photo and contract with my bank has to be 'coloured'. Very good in fantasy stories. Despite my e-mails to customer service, everything was designed to block the withdrawal. After a quick search on the internet, I've found a lot of cheated persons. Identity theft, theft of banking data extremely sensitive, high-resolution pictures with ID card in my hand and over $700 of mine unlawfully retained without permission or license granted by a credit institution or financial intermediation. I gave them 24 hours to solve the problem but they didn't care of my mail so I got to the police of my country and opened a law proceeding. I also advised mastercard, visa, paypal and skrill payment processors of the fraud by attaching the law proceeding and advised my bank of the fraud, filing a report with all data sent. Next step will be an enquiry to the international credit institutions for stopping this not-legal fraud (contract they show on website is not valid and full of illegal statements, they are not a bank).",1,freelancer.com

913,"I lost $1000 and 3 weeks of my work because of this website. I suggest to NEVER use this website if you want to freelance and intend to earn money. I have an account on this website for almost a year, used it to freelance and to work with freelancers. The last job I did was for $1000, I was hired as a web developer for 3 weeks, developed a web shop for a client.  I completed the project and the client released the money on 19th of July. It became available on my account, so I passed all the source files of the webshop to a client. Straightaway I submitted $1300 (had $1350 on my account) for the withdrawal which was supposed to happen on Monday (21st of July). I was on the Freelancer website on Sunday, had $1350 as before, but when I logged in on Monday, I realized that $1000 just vanished from my account. All signs of the project were deleted, the account of the employer closed. I wrote to the support and they told me that the money my employer used came from a questionable source, so they were returned to the originator.  The project was initiated by the employer on the 30th of June, the money ($1000) were submitted as a milestone payment THE SAME day. Freelancer decided that money came from a questionable source the moment when money were supposed to be withdrawn. So they were very comfortable to use them for 3 weeks and when it came to paying, they decided to question the employer and blocked his account...Now they suggest to contact employer, os that he pays outside the website! Seriously? When THEY allowed the milestone to be submitted and the project to be finished, the source files submitted to the employer?! Thank you FREELANCER.com for using 3 weeks of my life, charging me $100 and taking $1000 from my account!

I made the biggest mistake of awarding a project from their site & the freelancer turned out to be a fraud. Freelancer support has been pathetic with responses we cannot do anything.

If you're a quality freelancer looking to find jobs, don't go here if you live in the U.S. Most of the jobs here are employers (who clearly don't understand the need for quality) looking to hire people from India, Asia, or the Philippines with 'passable' knowledge of the English language. If you want a job that pays more than $2/hr you have to literally sift through hundreds of crap jobs. Their search functionality is lacking and clearly they didn't care about user experience when building the site. They probably used one of the $2/hour people to build their site.

917,"I wish I had googled before... So here comes my personal horror story: I just finished my first 200$ project and requested a withdrawel. For some ""security issue"" the first payout is delayed for 3 weeks (although it doesn't seem to be an issue to take my money immediately). Ha, of course, it got cancelled! I didn't even requested everything and left a bit, but won two big projects, wich freelancer booked from my account, so there was not enough left to make the withdrawel (remember: it's only a ""security issue"" to PAY you, TAKING your money is no problem). However, the projects were payed, i get 5-star ratings by my customers, but freelancer of course did not activated the old withdrawel, I needed to make a new one, again delayed for 3 weeks. So I am yet not paid for my first project wich was finished 5 weeks ago now. But it could get even worse: On the billing site I saw an advertise, that users should verificate their account. As an honest freelancer that seemed legit to me and I started the verification process voluntary. They have been sent 6 (in words: SIX!!!) photos of letters, wich do all apply to their terms, showing all my as well as the senders information. But guess what? That is not enough, although in their FAQ and their terms&conditions is stated that this is enough! It is nowhere mentioned, so I say thats a lie, but they insist they need to see the full documents, which are (in the first try) my bank statement and a letter from my healthinsurance. Are they INSANE? By the way: they never tell you why they reject it and just send you a $#*!ty auto-reply with no informations leaving you clueless, as long as you don't ask at least 4 times to give you a hint, what the problem is. They further rejected: full document photos from letters of my bank, one with no private information, one with a pencil covering the part after the ""THIS IS YOUR PIN: "" (yeah, for sure, I will just give you my online-banking pin, I just read all this positive feedback here and totally trust you...), a full letter from my landlord (ha, no proof! your landlord doesn't know for sure where you are living! You just rented that appartment to fool us!). They recommend to send some bills from utility services, but seriously: are they living in the 1990's? None of them, not a single one, absolutly no one of my utility services send printed out letters! Most of them even made the contract via mail. I wonder that they approved my mug-shot with the ID and did not request some naked photos ""to make sure my head is not photoshoped on"" (come on, be creative! you can invent some additional requirements spontaneously whenever you want!) as they are so very interested in the most private things. Now I'm stuck in an endless loop with morons from the so called ""support"", wich obviously can't read and just closed the ticket. Okay, to be fair: maybe they can read, but just not explain, why freelancer is violating their own terms and conditions. -----UPDATE----- Problem solved: I'm finally verificated with a pdf. That is just grotesque, because that would be, compared to all the photos mentioned above, really easy to fake. The FAQ says clearly scan or photo. Too, this secret (?) solution came just when it was too late anyway to request a withdrawel before that delayed first one... Wich wasn't even my main intention, but it's a bit to bearish, don't you think? This is long enough, but there are some more details that clearly shows it's to get a runaround. More than two weeks in wich I spent hours on that, countless mails to your support and at last a solution that could have been given in answer to my very first mail? As long as you can't refund stolen time or compensate it with my usual hourly fee I will not revoke that voting. And don't tell the feedback is ""appreciated"", when it's obviously the same problem for years! Shouldn't you just improve the customer service for every user of your site, than wasting time by searching the web and only react to those who complain in public? Btw: it's too late, when customers are already really angry and felt to be taken for a fool, that's not a very smart strategy... But to point out fairly: I don't say scam (yet, let's see, if I get my money...), that customer-service is just unacceptable!",1,freelancer.com

All this 2 years we find many professionals, where we work with and we spend money to several projects. First of all in every transaction the freelancer keeps a big percent of your money and when you ask to send your money, the time period can be up to 30 days!!! The reason for this late, it is that is for your safe!!! (???) Our story start when we send 500 euros, to our account, for a project, via Bank transfer, and after the project cancellation, before we start, we asked the money back, but this time, via our pay pal account. The freelancer, blocked our money, after 2 years, cooperation, as an suspected money laundering, because, we send money via bank transfer, and after cancelation, of the project, we ask the money back. (we speak about, for only 500 euros...Imagine, money laundering with 500 euros, is just ridiculous). Now, for unblock our account, the freelancer.com, ask to us, to send photo with an number that they send to us (like a prisoner - photo with mumber),my identity ( ID), my drive license, billing phone account, to show my address, etc.  Also we must explain why we sent the money via Bank transfer and why we asked to take it back... those money,from paypal, our answers was, ""ok you can sending it back to our bank, where they came from, no problem"",  Note, that they don't accept the cancelation reason(project cancellation) So, with goodwill, we sent all these information requested... The freelancer.com was not accepted any of these documents, that we send, and they asked to sending again, New photo, My ID ( again), official translate from my phone account (with official translator) etcetcI repeate, that all this was for 500 euros... The ""suspected money laundering""was for ONLY 500 euros....  - Today, I went and I spoke with the police (cybercriminal department, in Greece) to complaint against, those scammers.( Freelancer.com) The police told me that they use the law of their country (Australia) and they cannot do something. Eventually, simple we will waste 500 euros, that we had in our account, because we are not Australian citizen, and we can't do NOTHING. So, what you should be aware of, is that if you dispute with them ( Freelancer.com,and your are NOT Australian citizen, simple, you will lose your money. They are scammers and what they do, is to use the Australian laws to rob our money...legally...

The day before project completion all funds were retracted from my account by freelancer.com because the employer's account was ""questionable"" I could not contact my employer, because he had terminated all chanels of comunication.

Even worse, the employer is not responding at all. He had asked me to connect with another person for work while he will take care of only payments but now none of them are responding. I have messaged the employer several times but without any response. Would freelancer return the deducted money if the employer doesn't pay? Why is freelancer deducting money from freelancers accounts when they haven't earn a penny. I feel like cheated. I thought it was free to bid as was written all over but if the employer is the actual payer, shouldn't freelancer take initial deduction from them rather than from a freelancer who hasn't even earned a penny? I am really frustrated with the system even at start. There is no way a freelancer gets security? Now launching a dispute is the option suggest but with a precaution that it should be last resort.

I have to say it's very cool how it resembles a video game, with all the achievements, badges and many interesting items like exams and other things. I've noticed that they charge you fees for almost everything (that is ok,  it's business after all) but right now, I'm having some problems with my first costumer as he is relinquish to pay me even the first milestone, even though is just the 40% ahead.  It put me off the fact that this guys are not even ""fully verify"" and I reckon is just another bloody ""thief"" who wants the work for free. Don't get me wrong, I know that 70% of the people out there are the same (its a tough world) but I find frustrating that even with all those gadgets of yours, you cannot give me protection in this case. Not here just to criticise but I would like to give some suggestions, for example: 1.- Frelancer.com should not allow an ""unverified"" client to even create a bid on the first place. 2.- As soon as I accepted the bid, these guys took my money from my Pay-pal account, It would be just fear if you develop some kind of gadget that also takes the first milestone from the client into the freelancer account. That would make me feel more protected/secured. but regardless all the cool gadgets they've got, freelance.com is not offering me much more security that the average freelance job I can find on the streets  Seems to me that all this game works out nicely for them, but for us is the same battle as always. I really wish you could come back to me with some ideas or advises so I can keep your account, hoping to have an easier/Safe journey with you guys.

932,"The website blocks the funds of the service provider / freelancer only if a single client / employer files a reversal of a 'released' milestone. The client does not get anything but the freelancer is deprived of what he had earned from project. In addition, the website had already charged 10% which do not get refunded. This is exactly how it happened: 1. The project was under dispute, but I had won it and received the funds corresponding to the project value. 2. We closed the project, and the funds were added to the freelancer.com account. 3. A few days later, the funds corresponding to that project (around 130) were deducted from my account. I filed half a dozen complaint. Every time, I get the same response - 'The employer has filed a reversal, and she is the only one who can reverse it. We are not involved in your mutual business.' That practically means that the buyer thinks he has the right to get the work done, and then file a reversal to get 100% refund of what he had earlier paid - even ages after project was done.However, even he does not get the funds. This eventually results in buyer and seller thinking that the other has funds, while it is the website which gets away with the funds. I joined the website in 2011. By 2012 end, I was so much fed up with the website that I started using elance instead. I had lost around $600 (this is direct loss, indirect was that of cancellation of $2,500 project because I had stopped working on freelancer.com).  Later, I started getting mails and remainders that they miss me, there are new security features and improvements etc., and finally I again joined in 2014. It turned out to be the old wine in new bottle. I do not understand the following: 1. What is the purpose of this 'reversal' feature? Is it to help freelancer.com increase its profits through reversed funds (which are neither with contractor nor client)? 2. From my point-of-view, I delivered a service to a client, who has completed the payment. What he had paid is now my money. Is it reasonable for freelancer.com to expect its members to chase their past clients to be able to recover the funds? 3. The only reason why I use freelancer.com is that it is supposed provide a milestone service which ensures that the website will ensure clients' funds are paid to service provider if he delivers the project properly. However, if there is no reliability of milestones or account balance, what is the benefit of using the website? 4. Is it legal for a website to deduct the balances of its members on the basis of some 'reversal' feature? (To this, I got the answer that the website reserves the right to reverse any transaction between buyers and sellers. It is similar to amazon.com justifying the buyer's act of buying something from amazon.com, using it and then claiming a refund from seller. Having such terms and conditions is not a legal practice) 5. The client does not have the funds because she has already released them. I do not have the funds. So, where is the money? I never got the answer to these questions (except for q4, but again it was not justified).",1,freelancer.com

As i suggested i can simply create a fake account and then post a project for $2000-$3000 and go away. Result - freelancer looses $100-$150 ( if he has a standard membership) . Why would i do that to someone -could be simple reasons like i don't like a competitor . Would i do or done this personally on Freelancer.com - NO!! Was this done to me - YES!! and 4-5 times now. Thankfully it wasn't for that much and only lost $10,$20 and $5.... Here comes number 2 ! 1 week ago i was scammed out of $600 and Freelancer.com got even paid for it $30 fee, which they did not refund! Here is how it happened....As usual i posted a bid on one of projects and got contacted by client. He explained everything , but said that needs to get files from designer and then i can complete the job. Without any back thought i agreed to pay their designer through Skrill system and in return client paid in on Freelancer.com . Seemed nothing wrong. Next day my account goes -$600 and that money were returned to original client. Why?? As i found out later he was a fraudster and stole that money by hacking or whatever someone on Freelancer.com ...so support from Freelancer decided to take my money and give it back to fraudster and closed his account. Then they kept writing to me things like - contact your employer to get your money back, because i did supply them with all evidence of our conversations and all transactions through Skrill and Freelancer. The question is HOW THE HELL I CAN CONTACT HIM if you blocked and closed his account and what good it will do to me. YOU reversed supposedly irreversible payment and gave it back to him ( my honestly earned money) and most funny thing - you DID NOT refund my fee. So in the end i paid to get scammed on Freelancer.com....After looking very thoroughly in their policy and rules i sure can see that us freelancers are not protected in any way and all and we can get scamed or ripped off at any time and only winner here will be Freelancer.com. Well, i can tell you without hesitation - YOU A DISGRACE TO HUMANITY! You protect fraudsters and scamers and don't care about any of us - freelancers. Freelancer - people who make your site possible and who making you millions of $$$ by paying monthly fees and project fees and what you did in return to protect those very same people - NOTHING!! Your policy is a joke and has so many ""holes"" that for fraudsters this is like a heaven. I wish i was one of them myself now and did not have to work so hard every day. I don't want to paste here all your "" stupid"" responses from tier 2 management - too long, but i can see that some of those people got that job not through brain in their head for sure ! It may sound a bit rude , but its a fact and i am sure after reading this , you will realize that i have full right to say that. In the end your support still did not even refund $30 fee from fraud project, so you getting paid for this is actually making you an Accessory to Fraud, because you GOT paid for someone scamming me out of $600 and thanks to your ""stupid"" and full of ""holes"" policy he even got his money back for it. In the end - i worked through Freelancer.com for 1.5 years and already have a nice profile with a lot of reviews, because i don't sit around. I managed to get over 40 regular clients, who i may add i made pay always through freelancer system - wanted to be honest, but of cause could get paid through many other means and wouldn't have to pay 5% fees!!! Now, i will go to a different site and take all my clients with me - very disappointed in Freelancer.com . I am not going to scream that they are cheaters and scamers, but in my case they are accessory to fraud. Will i sue them - don't know yet, will have to figure out the costs and other things 1st. In the end fact is - they sure not preventing any type of fraud to happen to any of us .... So, think twice before you get yourself set up on Freelancer.com and be sure you ready to get stressed and cheated out one way or another. Freelancer.com is a paradise for fraudsters - FACT!!! Be aware - be VERy aware of this site !!!",1,freelancer.com

And I had competed 800 projects with 5 stars. So what was that? Some new way to scam me Marcus? Is this what you people do? You people are Einstein? When someone do not even work and get vanished after deadline pass, you people tell, it is solely our decision whom we hire and this is just a venue to work. Am I wrong Marcus? Is this what you people are doing? Just see the negative feedbacks here and see how many here. Just see how many here. So don't say here all people are fraud and you people are only the good one. Even for your checking I gave you my ticket number via which you people sent me message saying, I failed to deliver work that client was expecting and for this my account is closed. 800 reviews I had. 800. So don't even bother to say sorry. You people destroyed my life without any fault. God will teach you people a lesson. That's for sure. I verified my account 4 times. So obviously I am not a fraud.

Now after around 30 days Freelancer realises that the money was from a account which was fake so they just reverse the money back to the employers account. Why should the employer get back the money ? I worked for him, he paid me now its me who should get the money, but no, the money goes back to him. Freelancer's useless STAFF says that the account is closed and that I should contact the employer directly to receive money from him. Why will the employer pay me if he is getting the work done for FREE ? They say their STUPID POLICY states that if the account cannot be verified then the money goes back to the employers card. IS FREELANCER for us or for EMPLOYERS ? Why dont you create a website EMPLOYERS.com instead ? They say Freelancer money system is the best and most trusted, my foot i think its the worst system. Even paypal listens to disputes more clearly and gives a decision which is technically right. What does FREELANCER do ? What will they Do ? Do they have BRAINS ? NOPE. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE : NOW AFTER SUBMITTING A BANK STATEMENT THEY SAY THAT IT WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED, AS IT DOESNT MEET THEIR STANDARDS.

I havent any contact detail of employer except email. And after sending seven emails in 14 days, not a single reply. And cheater freelancer says they dont have money with him. I need my money MARCUS.

I had completed a job few days before and employer completed the review too. Then next day suddenly my account balance goes -272$. Review is also deleted from the profile. That is not the matter.  Main issue is there is milestone created since 3 days and they dont have time to review the card details, and when project is done, they simply reverse the amount(OR MAYBE THEY EAT THAT THEMSELVES and no notification at all for this non-sense. HEY MARCUS, WHAT IS THIS? YOU HADN'T EVEN REFUND MY FEES UNTIL I ASKED THAT. And also there is no notification for this. I just saw that and busted you thieves.  And when asked for refund, you said we cant do that. Contact employer. It is 3 days he hadnt replied too.  SO, EITHER SEND MY MONEY OR WE PLANNED TO HIRE A LAWYER AND FILE A DISPUTE AGAINST FREELANCER.COM PTY LTD. If I dont get my money. Also I told that give me one month golden membership instead.

949,"This is really frustrating and very irritating issue with freelancer which I recently faced. They simply deducted payment done by an employer earlier for some project and on top of that they did not even care to notify me for this deduction. I was one day just looking on my transactions when I saw that reversal transaction. I would have lost that money altogether if I would not have looked at my transactions. And the reason given was that my employer who had already paid me earlier, now has some issues with their account because of which my money is deducted now. Isn't it frustrating? Why do I have to care about issues with other people's account? Now, these guys are even not telling me what issue that other guy has with their account because of which my money is deducted. They just say: ""Your employer has some issues with their account, so we deducted your money"". Why? It sounds like, they are punishing me for somebody else's mistake. This is the whole case step by step: 1. I worked for some employer. 2. Employer was happy with my work. 3. So he gave me good rating and released the payment in around march. 4. Now in April, I was just going through my transaction. 5. I came across this weird transaction: Reversal of money was done. 6. I asked support people. First of all their support desk is really pathetic. They are just sitting there to waste your time. They do not know anything. They will simply ask you to ask someone ask for your problem. Finally, after much of problem, what I finally got is: They: ""Your employer now has some issues with their account"" Me: I asked what issues do they have: They: ""This we can not tell you"". Me: ""Then I said that this is wrong. You guys took my money without any notification, you should atleast give me proper reason."" They: Sorry, if you want to get your money back, then ask your employer to resolve issue with their account.  So basically it meant that I have to now beg my employer to resolve issue with their account so that I can get my money back which I earned by working hard on a project and Freelancer just took it without any $#*!ing issue from my side and even without giving any $#*!ing notification. Now, somehow I managed to convince my employer to resolve issue with their account. He said he did that. But I have not received my money back still. Freelancer so called support people still say that employer has not resolved issue with their account and employer says that he resolved. I just do not understand why the $#*! I am in this issue and why my money is taken. Because of this I really wonder how many times these guys might have done this earlier. I dont have any idea how much money I lost this way. I have many other issues which I would like everyone to know, so that other people do not fall in their trap. Freelancer.com is really a big fraud. They will just take your money which you earned by working hard on projects without any reason. I will highly recommend everyone, please not to use this website. They are $#*!ing fraud. I am in the process of setting up a blog to write all the frauds by freelancer.com. If anyone want to contribute to the blog and want to escalate the issues, please contact me. I want to take this to some serious people and I want to escalate these issues. We should really do something to stop this SCAM. I have lost money so times on this site.

950,These guys are total fraud. I have been trying to take my money out for about one month. I have tried for about 4-5 times and each time they create some issue and then they cancel my withdrawal.  I am already in loss of around 500$ because of these guys. I will not recommend anyone to use this site to get work. I am thinking of writing a big blog post regarding the problems that I have faced with freelancer.com and I will also put at least 100$ in promoting that blog post so that this cheater site freelancer.com do not cheat other people. I have faced tons of problems on this site.  Their support is the useless support I have faced till date. They never know anything. It is really very very frustrating working on this site. This company is really a big SCAM. They simply withhold your money for no reasons and then no one knows if you ever will cash on your earnings or not.

952,"UPDATE: I was finally able to get reply from a client for this project. They say they did not receive their money back, so where is it then? Also one of support workers at freelancer.com told me that they had to give a chargeback because it was an hourly project. What a joke. When I started on freelancer.com, some 3 years ago, it was a good website to find projects and earn decent money. Now, my latest project was the complete nightmare. Client decided to throw insults as soon as I have completed the work we agreed upon. Then said they won't pay and how I ruined their website. After trying to calm things down for over a week, which was longer than what project lasted, I decided to go for arbitration and paid $12 in fees just for that. Some 4 days later I got an email saying that client has released the funds (funds were in milestone) and that I have won the dispute. Even got XP for that, which I find extremely useless. Went to withdraw funds, only to receive another email that withdrawal was cancelled. I checked my funds on freelancer.com and it was all there. I have sent an e-mail to their support asking what's going on. This same day, several hours later, money was gone from my account, with no explanation whatsoever. What's worse I suddenly have a negative balance, so where did that come from? I tried sending another e-mail to freelancer.com support and got no reply. So once this negative balance has been resolved I will most likely close my account there and focus on other sites that give support to both freelancers and employers. I have contacted live support here is the summary: I won the dispute but due to the payment being made as milestone the client was entitled to get a chargeback. They released money to my account, charged me 10% fee then took money and gave it back to the client. I am done with freelancer.com, cancelled my membership and opened a dispute for arbitration fee. This is beyond belief.",1,freelancer.com

He made me pay a deposit before doing any work and once I had made the payment he disappeared. Freelancer.com was very unhelpful and refused to do anything about it. I then posted feedback about the freelancer to at least warn others and this was not posted. He was also wearing a freelancer.com Tshirt in his profile picture, which made me think he was a trustworthy member. Even though I have made a complaint along with several other employers about this specific freelancer he is still verified on freelancer.com I would definitely never use this site again and have asked them to close my account and refund the milestone credit I have.",1,freelancer.com
970,"Hello, first of all: You have to differ between the website and what you see there and a project that's gone south. The website can't help you with the latter and it's not their fault. So I'm using freelancer.com for a few days now, had two jobs and could literally watch how my money dissappeared. This sucks. I got all my money in USD to send some of it to my PayPal account it had to be exchanged to Euro. Of course to an exchange rate that's not even near the exchange rate a local bank would offer. After clicking OK I read that my withdrawal has been delayed for 15 days because of reasons for security. Ok, first withdrawal seems to be delayed, I can live with that. Two days later I had another job and the moment I clicked accept, they collected their project fee which is usually 3 $currency or 10% depending on what is higher. Sadly the project was in GBP. So they had to exchange some of my money to GBP again and did that. But they didn't use money that was in my funds, they took it from the 60 Euros that have been waiting for withdrawal and to be sent to PayPal. They also took 3.5GBP instead of 3GBP. So what happened now was: - I paid 3.5 GBP instead of the 3 GBP that are listed in the terms of service. - They did an exchange at an exchange rate that's not funny - They stopped my withdrawal because it had unsufficient funds now So I had to go back. Stop the withdrawal and ended up with 55.54 Euro. To be able to withdraw the money again I had to exchange it to dollars again to get other money out of my account too because you can't withdraw if the amount of the money that you try to withdraw is below 30 in the currency you like to withdraw it. (Yeah, right ...) So my money has been exchanged again, again at a rate that isn't funny. Now I have 130 USD left from a starting 185 USD. I wonder if I'll see any money at all after writing here... Another interesting thing is: If you take one of those tests it always costs 5 $currency where $currency represents your primary currency set in the settings. So it costs 5 USD or 5 AUD or 5 GBP or 5 EURO. That's scam.  The fact that those tests are just a bunch of $#*! is another scam. In some tests questions have been completely out of context or you had the feeling you're doing an english test during one of the network tests. Really really bad stuff. After reading a few of the comments here and my own experience in the last 4-5 days I'm not really sure I want to work with this website anymore. Their user support is kinda non existend. No reply, no questions answered nothing.  You can't even get most information in their help section. It's just not there. And how the rating is done if you possible get the job or not isn't explained anywhere either. It's kinda like somebody throws the dice and that's it.

And they allow work to be done by honest freelancers, and the other party to ""cancel"" the project before the worker is paid. They do not respond to emails. I have seen a couple of news stories about them in the US being fraudsters, and they are being investigated now by the FTC and their own government. Stay away!",1,freelancer.com

But i have send 2 mails to the support desk to ask for a cash back, because i have canceled that project. But no responsive, very sadly for a big and promising website like freelancer.com I hope you can solve this problem?",1,freelancer.com
974,"Extremely bad experience with this site. I got offered a translation project through their site but it turned out it was a completely fake. Freelancer.com took NO PRECAUTIONS to check the validity of the project or the user who posted it. However, they had no problem charging me with 15$ just for clicking accept in order to view project details. When I submitted an issue ticket with them, they COMPLETELY IGNORED IT - I received an automated response acknowledging the receiving of the ticket, then they LIMITED MY ACCOUNT so that I could no longer work on any project (WHY THE HELL DO YOU LIMIT MY ACCOUNT IF I SUBMIT A TICKET WITH YOU??!!!??). I never received a response about my ticket and I found that they just closed it some two weeks later without informing me - I found out because they had audacity to send me another automated email asking me to participate in the survey about their handling of the ticket. YOU DID NOT HANDLE MY TICKET, you ignore it. Please, put that option into your survey and I will maybe participate in it. Anyway, they completely wash their hands from everything because in their terms it says 'they only help freelancers to meet with employers and for that they take the commission'. Well, guess what, this goes both ways. If you are allowed to take my money for 'helping me to meet an employer' (in reality, tricking me into clicking Accept button on your site in order to view the project details), then YOU ARE ALSO UNDER OBLIGATION, according to your EXACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS, to provide EXACTLY what you PROMISE: putting me in contact with an EMPLOYER, not some random, unchecked user. Any honest company would simply RETURN the money (what would eBay do if I advertised selling a car and then just emailed buyers with a .jpg image of a Toyota?). This goes double in the case where NO ACTUAL MONEY HAS EVER LEFT THEIR HANDS. What I mean is, there was no money sent to third parties. It was freelancer.com that took money from me (and supposedly also from the fake employer) and said money is still with them. There were no services or costs where that money was spent and is now difficult to return. They could easily say 'sorry for not checking the employers background but since no money ever left our hands and no service was rendered to you (except clicking on a button), we now reimburse you'. But things do not work that way with freelancer.com. Please note that the only ones profiting from this system is freelancer.com - initially I thought I was scammed by some other user, but if things are as freelancer.com claims they are, then said employer was also charged with a commission and the only one benefiting is freelancer.com. Another issue, as soon as I submitted a PayPal dispute hoping to block them from taking my money, freelancer.com froze my account saying that now, suddenly, they need to confirm my identity. How will they do that - by me canceling a dispute with Paypal. WARNING: DO NOT CANCEL THE PAYPAL DISPUTE, EVER!! As freelance.com knows really well, once you cancel a dispute, you acknowledge that the other party is right and you CANNOT AGAIN raise any dispute about the same transaction (PayPal rules). Just another example of how freelancer.com tries to trick the users into renouncing their rights. (Also, please note that once your money has been taken - it happens automatically if you were foolish enough to 'verify your payment method' with freelancer.com as it essentially gives them full access to your paypal account and any connected credit cards - PayPal will not be able to help you as their money back guarantee does not cover virtual goods and services. I submitted my claims but freelancer.com completely ignored them, not even once did they respond to Paypal or to me regarding the case, knowing that they are safe and sound and that they have no intention of giving back my money.) In conclusion, AVOID freelancer.com like a plague. Even if you had positive experiences till now, the very fact they treat users like scum and ignore all complaints should be warning enough.",1,freelancer.com

I was happy to find a new opportunity for work on this site and thought all employers are serious and have their own companies. In the first month I have worked for a scam freelancer who was very difficult. I was making articles non-stop and he was asking me every half an hour if I am making progress. After 2 weeks I saw he was receiving great reviews and feedback for my work and was getting 10-20 more times money than I was for my work. So he was only using freelancers to take money.  After 4 tough and sleepless months I have finally made $300 to wake up on Valentine's Day with half of the amount gone and the other pending to a skrill account. I don't know how he did that because I couldn't withdraw any sum and normally it should be pending for 1-2 days. I contacted Freelancer and they haven't responded me for 4 days (!) but closed my account and sent me a message saying it's for security reasons. After that they have blocked my account and asked me different pictures to demonstrate it is my account!! (As it I was complaining of theft if it wasn't!). After more than 50 messages, they didn't respond me what they have done with that email who withdraw my money, they didn't answered at any of my questions and only used a formal message to repeat the verifying process. Now my account was released, but surprise, I can bid on different jobs but can't receive or send any messages and I already lost 2 jobs because I was informed on my mail that employers messaged me but I couldn't respond.

Their reasoning: Your funds are temporarily put on-hold while we are verifying details of your employer as they are currently facing some account issues with the site. We do understand that the funds were already released to your account as a payment for the project. However, we have a specific department within our organization that validates user accounts and the transactions made to and from. The funds will only be available for withdrawal once their account issue has been settled. Further details regarding the account issues of your employer can no longer be disclosed as only the proper department conducting the verification process has access to that information. We recommend to contact and advise them to visit the Verification Center for them to settle their account issues. If you are unable to contact your employer, we can also send an email to them upon your request.  My frustration: Why am I held responsible for my employer's account issues? Am I considered to be guilty for working with them? It's not my business what on earth is wrong with their account. A fat lot I care about it! It's their account! Not mine! I'm not asking why they are currently facing an account issue and I'm not interesting in any further details regarding their account. My honestly-earned funds are put on-hold. That is my only concern! Why are you holding me hostage in this situation? Why do I have to suffer from my employer's own problems? How do their own problems relate to me?

I'm not going to put up with this ignorant attitude towards me. It's against all rules! How can I possibly work under such conditions?  P.S. I've seen similar complains at http://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/www.freelancer.com#300 and at http://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/www.freelancer.com#21 P.P.S.

1023,"I was a 2 year member with 81 positive 5 star perfect reviews, I was tested within the top 1% for several of their skills like wordpress and Joomla.  I made several thousand through them.  I suddenly have one problem with an upset customer who lost a dispute against me in arbitration, who then lies to their customer service and tells them I hacked his website.  They instantly suspend my account and freeze my funds.  If you're one of those people like I was, reading these bad reviews thinking ""I have good feedback it won't happen to me"" think again, The MARCUS guy responding to these threads is the incompetent person that suspended me.  They don't care about your solid history with them, they'll believe heresy with no proof from a person who's brand new to their website.  They don't care about you. Don't believe what MARCUS tells you on these threads, and don't believe the next person they'll have auto responding to these after the fake MARCUS account gets a bad reputation.  A few months ago it was Elenor, now it's Marcus, it's the same person. Do not use freelancer for any business, they have the worst customer service of any website on the internet.  They are nothing short of incompetent, they are outsourced, their customer support is not Australian based and they could care less about the company, its reputation, or you.  You can try as hard as you want, you'll never get through to someone who has any sense.  You'll get better results pounding sand. Don't bother responding Marcus, my attorney has already contacted you.",1,freelancer.com
1024,"Please all people complain against them on this link they will verify issue: http://www.accc.gov.au/ (Freelancer.com don't right to hold payment of person who are not indulge in guilty). And I have taken this matter to Australian fair trade (ACCC Home). Did Australian government granted them any legal power?? It is under Australian Govt Jurisdiction. Also asked them why they think they have judicial powers.  If you are an employer or contractor make sure you are not falling in this trap. Fight for your right.  My username was silverhope' in freelancer.com ( Freelancer staff is illiterate, group of foolish and uneducated people) unable to verify simple documents. The are looting people by holding their payments more than 4 months. They cover their loss from service providers.  It is requested to write letter to Australian Government and tell them they are giving mental torture. Legally they have not right to hold anyone payment. Australian Govt require more applications to take action against them as per discussion. Freelacer.com staff and CEO is scammer. I planned to take legal action against CEO of freelancer.com who is cheater and dishonest person. He is very clever person. In other words he is trying to hold hard earned amount of service providers by different ways. I was user in freelancer.com since 2 years. I left my job because earning from freelancer.com was good. Now I am jobless. Reason is this I got $1000 in freelancer.com account from different clients. Freelancer.com CEO wants to fund for his personal benefit so he suspended different people account by making different reasons in which my account is also included. They hold my payments and refused to refund it. On the other hand they use different ways to get payment from service provider. Sometime freelancer.com staff reversed payment from your freelancer.com and make lame excuses that your client has reversed from his Paypal. Mean that service provider value in freelancer.com is like a dog. Suppose being a service provider you provide services to the client who are located in another country and you found him via freelancer.com platform. If freelancer has issue with this client regarding bank issue of client and client cleared your pay. If client get work from service provider and pay the service provider then freelancer.com will not allow withdrawing payment to service provider and send them message to ask your client so solve his bank account issue. How service provider responsible for the bank account of client. He paid us for our services and freelancer should take his responsibility himself. Service provider is not the servant of freelancer.com to verify the client account. If client don't contact then your hard earning will be in the account of freelancer.com. Government should take serious action against this website. My lawyer is making detail documents for them. Their staff is uneducated and cannot verify simple documents. If you want to save your time then create account in Odesk.com,vworkers.com and guru.com Freelancer.com has illiterate staff. Stupid people don't verify simple document . Staff will treat you like a dog. Soon I will take legal action against CEO.",1,freelancer.com

As we have more candidates and therefore we are having five different marketing peoples using the site with different accounts.  The strange stuff starts from here; #1 Recently, we noticed the most of the projects are being either canceled by Buyers or expired because of non activity. We have been awarded with some projects and as usual after accepting them, freelancer.com deducted fees (no issue with that).  #2 Second, those project's Buyers have requested us to stop working on projects because of change in mindset. They do not want to continue developing the project. So we mutually agreed to stop working and they deposited partial payment as we requested. #3 Now, what freelancer did. They have deducted payments as Reversal milestone and make negative balance in one of our account. Next, to remove negative balance, they converted other currency payment. Done all within an hour and we lost our hard earned payment. Now we have been trying to contact freelancer.com customer representative, but still did not get any response after 48 hours. Though, as a matter of fact, we posted general ticket and we got response within an hour. Should not we assume there is something wrong doing going on behind curtains?

I was trying to pay with my usual paypal and but they have charged my credit card which was never deposited into my account on freelancer. Don't know why they contacted you, it was their mistake.""  When informed freelancer about it they said they as per terms, I am not supposed to get my money back until buyer refunds and they did not even pay me back their fees that they have taken. They say they wont contest the chargeback even. So, apparently, you dont have any security on freelancer They would pay you for your hardwork and then they would take money back for their own issues and they would not even return the fees.

1052,"Freelancer.com - this site used to be a marketplace for people to find work and others who want to get their work done. Just after this site got merged with scriptlance.com and vworker.com (Rent a coder - old name), the pool of freelancers increased to millions. Most of them from Indian and from Pakistan, Bangladesh. Now the situation with freelancer is that they are not interested in looking at the way projects are being posted or whether there is any minimum bid policy. People on freelancer can ask for anything that can take weeks and just post $30 to get this done. Obviously, many will jump into this to get done, but the problem comes for employers after they start work with such people. They either don't get satisfied work or get reasons from freelancer that scope is increasing. The problem is somewhere in middle, it is freelancer's bad policy if exposing others bids, others profile that make the situation so vulnerable. Is there anyone who wants to pay more for getting something done, when there is some one else who is so confident to say he can get it done. Freelancer is just getting more and more worse day by day and they are just looking to be interested in making their UI more beautiful and fancy. Come on freelancer, focus on value which has created your base of business. Focus on your freelancer and employers who work together. See how many of them are happy.

The quality is typically inferior, as most jobs are required in 'real' English, something that cannot be delivered by most from the sub-continent and far east members on the site, who are awarded the jobs because they are cheap to hire. As a Native UK speaker and writer, I cannot find anything on the site that becomes worth my time as I am not prepared to work for such ridiculously low amounts. 2. Because the bids are low, the projects are rewarded at the lowest cost - then the employer wonders why the quality is no good! You get what you pay for and if you want to cut costs - write articles yourself or pay proper money, to 'real' native English writers (From UK, US, Canada, Australia), who can actually string a sentence together correctly. Of course, Freelancer do not care about the quality, and will wash their hands of this aspect of the project - all they want is money.

1060,"www.freelancer.com gets most traffic of freelancers, old and new, in view of its convenient and easy to remember domain name. In my opinion, that's the first trap laid out. I am seriously considering sticking to www.odesk.com and www.elance.com as they are more publicized, professional and have far more good reviews. I will close my www.freelancer.com account for good due to a couple of reasons. First, freelancers on www.freelancer.com have to bid and compete for projects. Freelancers from third world nations, like India and Pakistan, have ruined the market.  They are more dominant in bidding as they can go really cheap to a level that is ""ridiculously"" low. They are able to stoop so low due to favorable exchange rates. They surely need to establish ""minimum bid"" policy on projects and quality control on freelancers. Second, www.freelancer.com takes such a long time to process my payment and at the end of it, it keeps disputing several payments on work done with all sorts of excuses.  As a result, this held back the whole sum that I have requested ""cash out"".  I have been doing freelancing as a full time job via www.freelancer.com for almost three years now. As my numbers add up, it keeps disputing and delaying payment of amounts due to me. It's habitual. Recently, they froze my account at their whims and fancy.  I give a big NO recommendation on www.freelancer.com to anybody. DO not waste your time and effort. Consider www.odesk.com or www.elance.com. They honor payments promptly.",1,freelancer.com

Their Customer Service is absolutely the worst and my first go around with them, I thought perhaps I was going insane. As far as money and time invested into this site versus a return? I have lost thousands of dollars (I can easily prove this by averaging the amount of money that I made via other routes as a freelancer and not through freelancer.com). Between the gamification that never works correctly to the nearly 90% of jobs I bid on actually expiring because the creators of the jobs just left them hanging (and I have bid on well close to 50-60 jobs and submitted proposals with said bids) to the fact that their marketing is geared toward constantly making you spend money to ""highlight your bid"" or ""take yet another test to move ahead""... it's absolutely sad and I regret every cent and bit of time that I spent with freelancer.com. If 90% of the bids I had just simply expired yet I spent all this time highlighting and taking tests to win them and answering questions of the job owner before they left running.. this means I was coaxed to spend more and more money by the website with repeatedly getting no return.. while making money and thriving as a freelancer through other means and websites so I know its not my ability or presentation... and if I google freelancer.com, nothing but terrible reviews come up for them.... well..

1066,"Signed up with freelancer.com four months ago and have applied for around 30+ jobs. Unfortunately, every job ended up 'expired', which means the job posting was never awarded to anyone. I am now personally convinced that freelancer.com outsources fake job postings and more than likely pays their workers their standard outsource hourly fee of 1.17/hour to post fake jobs everyday!!  I am also convinced that the supposed 9 million users are mostly fake or scam accounts. And the legitimate employers are the ones that want to pay you 20 bucks for 100 hours of hard work!! I also just read in a freelance poll that 46% of freelancers never receive the full amount agreed upon which shows the great need for better protection for freelancers. Obviously, reading these reviews here, shows this as fact. In reading all these reviews about people getting ripped off, I am now glad I did not get awarded any jobs because chances are that I would have been ripped off anyway. The only good thing freelancer.com is good for is for the entertaining reading of their fake job postings, which some are totally hilarious!! And I get a kick out of how some of these losers post a job ""I want exact replica website like booking.com"" with a budget of 80.00 bucks!! And then there are 30 bids!!!! WTF??? LOL!!!

Customer Service were unhelpful and advised me to try and convince the employer to follow Freelancer's instructions in sorting out the problems with his account. Who am I, the employer's mum?

1088,"I have been using freelancer for MANY years and have over 100 5 star reviews as a freelancer and 38 5 star reviews as an employer. Everything was great until last week and this week, they handled a situation VERY BADLY, in fact its still ongoing and no resolution has been placed yet.  Let me recount the events for you guys: I went on vacation to mexico in early october, I came back and realized that my location had changed to bangaladesh, I thought that was weird, but in my mind I just thought that freelancer did that because they wanted me to re-verify my address which was still kind of weird logic but I didn't think too much of it at first.  Next, I logged into my email and found emails saying I tried to add a new payment method and I was trying to withdraw to that payment method. I thought that was very weird. Third, because of the strange activity I changed my password and notified freelancer that I believe my account was hacked and they should resore everything how it was previous to the hack occourance, which by the way was the same exact settings I have had on my account for many YEARS!  Freelancer replied to that by shutting down my account completely, asking me questions, taking 24 or more hours to reply each time, going back and forth with more questions. Then once the questions were over they asked me to send them proof of my residence, my photo id with a code attached, they approved my documents and gave me my account back. I thought to my self, finally this terrible ordeal they put me through is over, IT WAS NOT OVER! Now I was not able to withdraw funds from my account or cancel milestones either! I had a customer who was under dispute with me I had agreed to cancel their milestone and I could not do it, I also had funds that I could not take. This is terrible and stopped me from doing any more business on freelancer.  Now Freelancer keeps asking me for the same documents which I already provided the first time to get my account back, they ask the same things over and over to the point where they will soon put me out of business.  I live with my mother, her name is on the utility bills, I sent copies of my bank statement, my photo ID, my face to match and their silly little key code which is completely un neccesary but I sent that too and still they are not happy even after I already sent it to them when they first froze my account and they already approved it..... I don't know what to say, maybe freelancer just no longer wants me :(",1,freelancer.com
1089,"Up until a few days ago I had read the reviews on sites like this and knew how bad people claimed freelancer.com claimed to be. It didn't bother me, because I was making good money at the time. Last month I cleared almost $1800 from the site as a relatively new freelancer that joined just a few months prior. Everything was good until the problems started. First of all the milestone system is terrible. It is a false sense of security. I found this out when I was paid $150 for a project and then two days later logged into my account to see it reversed. I of course immediately contacted freelancer support via their chat option and this was a complete waste of time as they are absolutely no help. The support is indeed VERY terrible. If you don't believe me, contact them right now and try to get anything resolved with your account. Like others have said freelancer supports delivers the same copy and passed messages over and over again and has no power to actually resolve anything. They will simply tell you they will forward your ticket to another department this department may or may not respond and they cannot resolve anything either.  Freelancer.com support told me the employer who had paid me had issues with their credit card and so they had to reverse the payment and that there was nothing they could do. ""Okay"", I thought, at least I hadn't withdrawn the money, so I didn't actually LOSE anything but hours of work. I'll live. Unfortunately, the shenanigans of freelancer.com's inadequate policies didn't stop there.  The other day I logged in and noticed my account was $-200, I had $50 in my account prior to logging in and naturally I was confused by this. I checked my transactions and it turns out freelancer.com had reversed ANOTHER milestone for a project I had completed THREE WEEKS PRIOR! I couldn't believe it! I of course contacted freelancer.com support who told me I should contact the employer to get their account fixed (of course I haven't spoken to the employer or seen them online in over 3 weeks, so good luck). The, milestones, chargebacks, and poor support aren't the only problem on the site; the dispute system is terrible as well. I've only been involved in two disputes and I have over 20 five star reviews on my profile. Well, my two disputes were over the exact same problem; the employer refusing to pay for the work I had completed. The first time it happened it was only over $30 USD and we both pleaded our case and I didn't even upload screenshots it took 3 weeks but the arbitration team finally ruled in my favor. I should also note the employer was almost as new as I was, but he had several 5 star feedbacks as well Fast forward to a month later and I run into this problem with a brand new employer. Every freelancer knows sometimes you run into an employer that you cannot please no matter what you do. The employer cancelled the project while I was trying to remedy the project and filed a dispute. This time it was over $300 with the EXACT same set of circumstances. This time, I even uploaded screenshots of the employer agreeing to at least make a partial payment for the work I had already completed.  3 weeks go by and I finally get an email saying I've LOST the dispute. This employer was also brand new and had 0 reviews; in fact, I was their very first project. So in short: your odds of winning a dispute are the same as flipping a coin in the air. Doing the math: $150 for the first reversed milestone, $250 for the second, $15 for losing the dispute $200 for the settlement amount I agreed to (out of $300) and lost. That's $615 Freelancer has successfully SCAMMED me out of. If you're working for this site and you haven't been scammed yet you've been lucky but as I said your luck will run out sooner or later.  If you are going to use the site never let your balance get too high.

They apologyze and ask me to deposit 10 more from my PayPal account, so they would allow me to withdraw my money as a ""one time courtesy"". I did deposit 10 and... wow! now I have 30 stuck in my freelancer.com account: they still don't allow me to withdraw them, because you ""can only withdraw money you earned from work, not what you had deposited from paypal"".

1091,"I join freelancer.com just couple of days ago, thinking that I will make some extra money. I was asked to verify my account by adding a payment method which I did by adding my Paypal account. I got my first project awarded today by some fake employer with no ratings. I don't know how he was allowed to award me the project because as per Freelancer policy, an unrated employer needs to deposit 20% of the project value before awarding it. They didn't collected this amount from him as they new he was fake but went ahead and charged my legitimate Paypal account with $12.59 CAD as their commission of the Project value which I didn't receive a single cent yet and will not receive as the employer is fake. I immediately stopped further direct debit from my Paypal account to prevent Freelancer to extract more money from me. I don't understand whether their motto is to generate income for us or to rip us off. Anyways, when I complained they say their project fee is non-refundable and whether the employer pays or not it is your problem not their. They got my money so they are enjoying. I have raised a dispute on the transaction with Paypal on the grounds that Freelancer should have collected 20% project value from the unrated employer. Lets see what happens. I want to caution all of you to think twice before getting into this. I am a seller on eBay and if for some reason the buyer doesn't pay then eBay reverts back the commission.

We wanted to use the money already in our account to pay a second developer we hired, which freelancer didn't do, because they needed additional account information. After completing the informatinos they wanted nothing happened, excpet that they were threatening us to close our account. Sending emails and support tickets did not change anything, they wanted us to grant them permission to pay the first job (which still is unfinished). We lost approx. US$ 800.- there, our account doesn't exist anymore. They closed the case we opened, we had to remind them many time that the dispute is not solved. A few investigations showed that several people use freelance.com to systematically rip off people that offer them work. The way that freelancer.com functions perfectly protects fraudsters of any kind, once you got money in an account there you will never ever get it back. What they do and how they do it is illegal in our country. The purpose of a site like freelance is to protect people who make business using their site, but as it looks they only care about the money that flows through their site, and giving their best to restrict withdrawals. In generally we don't work anymore with freelancer sites, we hire freelancers directly after having talked to them on skype and after having them finished a little project (something stupidly simple like a ""hello world"" without any value or use). Every serious developer is more than willing to invest 30 mins in order to get a job that pays well. Stay far away from freelance.com, roasting marshmellows over burning dollar bills is much less frustrating.",1,freelancer.com

1095,"It is some kind of trap website. Hidden fees everywhere. Robot-like unfriendly support and even some bugs.  I created my first project. I made a mistake in creating a the project, no way to remove it. Or you have to pay them to remove it again!? You create a project, send them money, they block your account because they need verification about the payment??? I paid via Paypal. So what do they need to verify? Directly after my payment I get phone calls from Russia. Paypal seem to have given them my phone number. Support does not seem to even read what you wrote in your emails. They just get a few word and reply. So you have to keep your sentences really short, precise and still write it two or three times. I send them my first payment, I get a ""Plus Membership"" for free. Until next months, then you have to pay each month.",1,freelancer.com
1096,"Wow... I've register on this site like very long time ago, I would say 2008-2009 and I bid on several projects won few of them, finished job got some cash and I got regular job and never logged in back again. Few years passed, I forgot my password, obliviously my account was deleted. That's ok, I was inactive. Got back again, lot of changed. I mean a lot. Exams are ok thing to do, that way they are keeping scams away and earn some cash as well, these days pretty normal stuff. What I don't like, every single step you got bunch of fees and you got impression that you came there to get a job, grab some money and move on and on, but I see it opposite, like u came there to pay them for the job, funny. Almost, after reading these negative reviews it's perfect system designed for scums, to take your hard work for nothing, and freelancer got their ''policies'' of defense. Sounds like very-well designed system to treat you like a modern computer slave. Now, since a lot of time passed, I start reviewing other people and their opinions, I will step back and leave it to people who already place their effort there. But as for a newbie (not really, but on their site you are) I see no interest to spend valuable time there.",1,freelancer.com
1097,"I had a client who just vanished owing a fair amount of money ($1.5k). Freelancer of course had taken their commission and refused to refund me until I had contacted my client. I tried to get my money back for six months before telling Freelancer that it was their system I was using, that had let me down so surely if that was the case they owe me the full amount for the job. They decided just to refund the commission in the end. I shouldn't have had to threaten them and I should have been given some sort of compensation as an apology for their poor service. I won't be using them again (I made sure I withdrew all my money from my account before posting this as I just don't trust them).",1,freelancer.com
1098,"Hi I am using freelancer.com since years now, it was a good site at first, really fast, php-based. I won't complain on money issues here because, to be honest, I never had an issue with them about this, other than usual withdrawal delays and high fees. Not to mention I don't tend to hold a lot of money on there, not even on paypal; I usually withdraw to my atm card as soon as I can. I don't trust none online service to hold my money.  Now, freelancer.com made changes during the years, most of them terrible, i.e. website speed, limitation on bids for free users and others. Always to damage the worker and focus on their own pocket selling you memberships. The site used to fly back in 2006 when it was purely php based, no Ajax, no crap whatsoever. Now, it's full of that, you get Ajax up your ass even from going to page 1 to 2 through projects before bidding. Ajax sites are slow, didn't you know it GAF? Java is slow, Javascript is slow, didn't you know it? I remember clicking on my user profile and having to switch to a faster laptop I have at home because the page simply didn't load on a decent P3, 1ghz RAM. Isn't it a P3 1ghz RAM enough to display a black and white, non-flash page properly and fast? They seem to have fixed that, though Now, this is the problem we have now and this one is *serious*. Since 10 days ago freelancer changed something that's ruinning our businness and they care $#*! fixing it. I am talking about the private messaging system which is *now disabled* when you bid. This means you can't send samples to your employeer, nor private messages anymore. Unless customer starts a private message.  And this is not even the worst! Line break is not respected in your bid text!! So, now that you are not allowed to send private messages (unless customer starts a private message with you), you have to place links in your bid text in order to actually have a *chance* to get the job! Read below the conversation we had with customer support: --- > Freelancer >staff: ""Keep in mind that our site does not support line breaks on the bid page. "" Me: And do you think this is something to be proud of ? Is it like a ""feature"" ? So are you telling your whole 9 million users that not having the ability to properly space paragraphs out, making the whole text a whole unreadable mess is a feature or something to be proud of!?! Imagine you have to write in your bid something bulleted such as: Paragraph 1 Details: - line 1 - line 2 - line 3 - line 4 Paragraph 2 - link 1 - link 2 Your buyer will read it like: Paragraph 1Details:- line 1 - line 2 - line 3 - line 4Paragraph 2- link 1- link 2 *** And are you saying this is a feature and not a bug of freelancer.com that should be addressed? *** ---- This is totally unbelievable, all they have to do is replacing the line break by a <br> upon displaying the bid text and they are not doing it. It's a whole line of code what they have to add. This is getting us *no job* since days, damaging our busines while in the past we had a strong customer messaging based on the samples we showed My experience as a business man tells that you can convince a customer better with a good sample rather than with a small paragraph of text telling him that you are an expert in the field. Both thigns are killer, but if one of them is missing you don't make it If their approach was avoiding spam and/or copy/paste messages with this measure, this is not the way to handle it I strongly suggest everybody post a ticket into their support system in order to let them know as a community that we need the private messaging system back OR AT LEAST the line break respected in bid's text Regards Paul",1,freelancer.com
1099,I joined this site just recently and was amazed at the ways in which they charge money for every single thing. Since when was being a freelancer about losing money and not making money? This poor Marcus guy who keeps coming here and responding to all this criticism! He's fighting a losing battle I'm afraid.,1,freelancer.com
1100,"First to be clear the only way to contact this hugely profitable company is with a support@ email address, thats it, no phone number. I am trying to get someone at freelancer.com support to actually do something about one of thier members, who threatened and bullied me, hacked into my site, using the hack code HE had left in it, while do a project that he never completed. He then blackmailed me into payment and leaving a 5 star review or he would delte my whole website. He much glee in this fact. 'you need to leave me review, i can't leave it like this.' 'i am following you on this. ' 'you are gonna pay big for this. ' 'i want it 100% positive or I will take all your stuff down ' I have now sent 7 separate emails to Freelancer support, where I am told '  'We recommend that you communicate with your freelancer to resolve any project-related issues amicably.' Well I have tried and tried, begged infact for him to leave me alone, he had even called me 3 times to abuse me further. We have now had to block his number, his IP address in India.  I have even email him this morning to ask again for my money back, then told him I have notified them of the abuse, he has literally told me, that he isn't worried as Freelancer.com won't actually do anything. So clearly this has happened before. To clarify he hacked into MY website and blackmailed me into payment and the review and they seem to be supporting this guy, I presume because they get more money from him than me, absolutely shocking. Surely they cannot let this happen to someone else. Why don't you surprise us all Freelancer.com and actually do something about this?",1,freelancer.com

All they do is ask for more ID. After 9 scanned documents uploaded on to the site, a dozen emails vis the help centre. All I recieved is a generic email referring me back to the verification back on the website. It told me my details didnt match my ID details. So I scanned screenshots and attached those for their reference too. 2 days later my account is still on hold and nothing from freelancer.

1102,"Beware!!! This site is a scam! They make you put money in escrow to use the site and hire programmers. Then once you have money in your account they freeze your account so you can't pay any of your programmers or transfer your money back out to your bank account. Then they send you a message saying you need to ""verify"" your identity and that your money will be frozen until you do. I tried 10 times to do this. I uploaded my drivers license numerous times and other forms of governement id. But they kept saying they dont accept it for one reason or another and making up excuses. So eventually they stole over $250 from my bank and I had to file a fraud alert with my bank to get the money back. And my programmers on Freelancer didnt get paid either. The only ones who got paid were the crooks at freelancer I am filing a complaint with the BBB and hopefully my bank will decide in my favor. WHAT A SCAM FREELANCER IS!!! BEWARE!!!",1,freelancer.com
1103,how much did Marcus C bid for the job answering negative reviews on this site?,1,freelancer.com
1104,"Freelancer is the worst website to start your freelancing career. I say this because I got burned several times but everytime that happens, I went back hoping it would get better but it never did. My experience just got worser every time. 1. In the beginning, I accepted several projects, so I got deducted $5 each time. Even if you project is just for $30 or less, you still get $5 deduction. Even if the client does not communicate to you anymore, they still won't refund the fee to you 2. The first time you withdraw money from them, you will need to wait THREE WEEKS. This is an absolutely ridiculous rule.  3. I entered a 'guaranteed' contest worth $750 usd. Their guideline says that if the contest holder does not award a winner, the contest prize will be split among the contestants. Because the prize at stake was big, and because I knew I have a likely chance of winning, I decided to join the contest. It took me a week to prepare my entry since I had to research about the company, read their requirements, write a script, find a voice talent, hire a professional recording studio to do the job, find someone who knows how to edit an audio file and add sound clips to make a decent radio ad jingle, and finally, summon all my courage to submit. I was able to convince the voice talent as well as the audio editor that we would split equally if we win, but I already paid for the recording studio's fees. After more than a month, they credited my account $75 since the contest holder did not award any winner. BUT at the same time, they deducted 10% from the amount, which is $7.50 as prize fee. This was okay until Freelancer decided to reverse the payment and deduct me $75 without any notice! Yup, that's right, they can spam your email with daily notifications of projects but they never give you a notice for something as important as your money! I've since withdrawn the money to paypal and only left a few dollars so now it turns out I owe them $60! That's just absurd. Please note that I never even fully received $75 because they also deducted the prize fee of $7.50, but when they decide to reverse, they deduct me the full $75! So this basically means that I paid $7.50 as prize fee for a contest that I didn't even win in the first place! 4. They allow employers to post projects that have budgets which are way too low. Logo designs at $10 (of course, the freelancers actually only get $5, because the other $5 is for their non-refundable fee), and writing jobs at $0.5 per 500 words! I mean, how's that even fair?  5. Let me repeat, this is the worst website to start your freelancing career. I'm shifting to Odesk, Elance or People Per Hour.",1,freelancer.com

1106,One of the worst experiences in my life. Multiple things have happened since I have used freelancer.com and they are all bad. 1. They take fee's out of everywhere. So you are not getting even close to the amount you are charging. 2. Everyone just spams you messages and nothing ever gets done. 3. There support is basically next to none. 4. I did a job and completed it. I went to withdrawal my money and waited a week and then I get a notification because the person I worked for is under review. That is the biggest line of crap I can think of to hold onto MY money. I worked and performed the job. I should be able to pull out MY earned money even if they are reviewing the other account which I am not connected too. I would not use freelancer.com unless you want to waste time & money. I would consider using glance.com or odesk.com because this was absolutely horrible.,1,freelancer.com

1109,"I am fairly new to this website and am already considering never using it again. I have used the website a few times with success but have twice had problems with the freelancers I have hired off the website. This last one though just did it for me. I need some SEO work done on my website. Instead of opening a project for bidding, I looked around for a freelancers by checking their feedback. I finally decided on one and contacted them ( seoleader1). According to their feedback, everyone raves about how they got good work done and how easy it was to work with this freelancer. He accepted the project right away after agreeing on the terms. He then told me that I need to release a milestone (pay him) before he even starts the job because everybody else that he as worked for had always done it. I was hesitant but finally said fine and went ahead and did it. Little did I know that as soon as you release a milestone, the project is marked as completed. I was concerned but he reassured me that I can trust him to get the work done and his feedback is proof. He then asked me to leave him feedback, that after a project is completed, I only have 5 days to leave feedback, that if we left good feedback for each other, we both would benefit with good reviews on our accounts. That is when i really started getting concerned and said absolutely no way I would leave feedback. I asked when he would be done and he said it would take 3wks. Just before 3wks was up, I contacted the guy to ask how my project was going and he told me that everything was ok and on schedule. A few days after the three week deadline, I contacted him again, he didn't respond for a couple days until after I threatened to contact freelancer. To cut it short. I contacted freelancer to try and get a resolution and all they told me was that its my fault that I released the milestone and there was nothing they could do. Even with evidence that this guy is a scam. Not sure what I will do to get my refund, I guess I am out $80. Be aware of this freelancer if you use that freelancer.com ( seoleader1).

They charged me $16 dollars when I took the job, and despite numerous complaints to them, they have only emailed her, and told me to be patient. I finally received a response from her a week ago that she had not looked at my work, and would get back to me that night. She did not. Freelancer is a scam. They have not offered to refund my fee, and she is still operating on the site. There is no move to suspend her, or penalize her and what seems to be others who use the name in her account.

IT'S SAD WHEN YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE PLATFORM MORE THAN THE EMPLOYEES. Hate to leave employees I enjoyed working with but you cannot trust the management here with your credit card info AT ALL!,1,freelancer.com
1134,"They are a SCAM. I had an account at rentacoder, which later changed to vworker - recently vworker was transfered to Freelancer, including my account balance. rentacoder was quite good, vworker less, but Freelancer is as close to scam as i can be. I have used an insanity of time in finding a skilled coder for a simple job in html and css - but bidders turn out to be middlemen, contractors, false bidders, or/and not what they claim to be.  Trying to find a freelancer and inviting to the project, after three attempts, where they all decline from the project, its clear something is going on - bit by bit Freelancer empties my account in fees - lately I found that I had a premium membership of 24.95 USD, even I havnt signed up for any membership - so I expect they will draw this amount any day now. My account balance transfered from vworker, I dont expect to get my money back. I dont expect to get any work done. Probably when Freelancer have emptied the account balances they got from vworker, they will start yet another company with new name, transfer the balances, empty the accounts into their own pocket - etc etc etc. So freelancer.com, stay clear - they ARE a scam.",1,freelancer.com
1135,"A few months ago I posted a couple of projects on freelancer.com associated with work I was doing for a client of mine. The first thing I didn't like is that I had to pay a $9 membership to be able to post projects, but when my client cancelled the work I went to the site and cancelled the project postings, and then, trying to have everything tidy, I deleted the projects associated with that work, unknowingly incurring in a $5.75 charge per posting FOR DELETING a posting. It's an idiotic notion to charge money for something you're not going to use anymore. But the freelancer.com people didn't strike me as idiots but as thiefs, applying charges and telling you only after the moeny is in their pockets. I recommend you use Elance.com. They are complete professionals, you can post for free and they won't charge a penny for deleting stuff. They will be completely honest and tell you what to expect, and you can believe them.

1137,"Hello, I've recently logged into my freelancer.com account after quite some time. To my knowledge I had £60 in my account which was for a previous project I'd posted on there.  I selected a freelancer for a job, but upon receiving actual reviews on his work rather than the fabricated ones on the site I decided to pull the plug, as the freelancer was dishonest and incapable of completing what was needed, therefore my money was safe and secure in my account and ready to use on another job....or so I thought. Upon logging in yesterday, I notice my balance is 0.00GBP, upon contacting freelancer regarding the issue I was given this response ""Our records show that your account has been charged of monthly dormant fees. The balance in your account which was £60 GBB was converted to USD to pay for these fees. These charges are made for storage, bandwidth, support and management costs of providing hosting of the user's profile, portfolio storage, listing in directories, provision of the HireMe service, file storage and message storage."" I was not initially made aware these fees were charged (It's well hidden in the T's & C's), I was not made aware when the fees were taken, nor have I received an invoice or bill of any sorts.  If I'd have know this was the case I'd have prefered to give the money to the initial consultant than freelancer.com! I'm now wondering If I'm in debt with freelancer.com as my balance is 0gbp so obviously the dormant fee has surpassed the amount in my account! In conclusions - STAY AWAY FROM THE SITE! FREELANCER.COM IS THE SCAMMER NOT THE CONSULTANS AND WORKERS ON THE SITE! Just search google for 'freelancer.com scam'",1,freelancer.com
1138,"My problem is not with a contractor on freelancer.com, but with freelancer.com themselves. I clearly documented a problem with their site which caused me to pay a contractor twice for the same work. Their customer service completely ignored the issue, blaming me, and accepting no responsibility. Even though I had clearly documented the issue with screen shots and a bug report. Payments for projects are handled in ""milestones"". You create a milestone for a dollar amount, which represents a portion of the project. When that portion is complete, you release the milestone payment to the contractor. I had a dispute with my contractor and offered to settle partial payment, for partial work completed. So used the milestone option for partial payment. Freelancer.com then reported back to me that the entire milestone amount had been cancelled, with no indication of any partial payment being made, and the milestone was removed. By contrast, if I had paid the full milestone, it would clearly show as ""payment released"". Therefore, I would expected that a partial payment would show some indication of ""partial payment released"", possibly including the ammount. Instead, the milestone was removed completely as ""canceled"". Wanting to be a good employer and honor my original agreement with the contractor, I created a new milestone of the amount we had agreed on, and released that payment to the contractor. A few days later, I found the option to see my transaction history, which is buried deep in the website. There I found that they had released payment for both the partial payment, and the second milestone. I went back to the project section where there are a few places to view milestone history, and they all showed the second milestone as being the only one paid, with no indication of partial payment on the first milestone. I realized that this could get confusing very fast, so I took the time to document the bug in the proper format, along with screenshots that show how freelancer.com doesn't provide the correct information. After a couple help tickets (they have no phone support, and take a full day for any kind of email correspondence), I am now giving up and just won't use the site anymore. All reps I emailed with told me that ""Freelancer does not release payment, only the employer does this."", completely ignoring the fact that they told me the milestone was cancelled for the full amount, when it had actually been partially paid. I understand that websites sometimes contain bugs or usability issues, but the fact that they completely ignored the real underlying issue, and refused to take responsibility, is a stance that I can't accept. I would strongly recommend to other people thinking of using the site to proceed with caution.Your review will help others learn about this website.

1139,"Here is my 2C about Freelancer.com I have started using this website to outsource work back in 2007 when they were still getafreelancer.com  Things were ok for me at the time and I was happy with their fee and the way website functioned. I had posted and completed around 300 jobs on their website. As said, at the time I thought fees where fair and I was getting the job done. I even suggested two changes to the platform to them and both were implemented on the site.  This year I had bit of a break and did not use them for a while. Then I got some more work to do and naturally, I logged into my account to post the job. And got nasty surprise. Their fees have gone up by double and are now the most expensive fees in the freelancing. I have no idea how much of the cut are they taking from freelancers but me as an employeer was charged fee for posting (fair enough but still rates are stupidly expensive), then I was charge for transaction to pay them, charged fee for canceling one of the projects that did not go ahead and it just seemed that all of the sudden they are the greediest bunch in the industry. So I moved on to other platforms that are far better. I am not working for any of the competitors so I won't mention who am I using now but there are far better and choices out there for hiring freelancer.  Forgot to mention that some of the freelancer I met there and worked with (and still am but on the freelancer.com) have left as well as they told me horror abuse stories about percentage they were receiving from freelancer.com It seems that slavery mentality is alive and prospering in Sydney HQ of Freelancer.com Stay away from them.

I informed Freelancer.com immediately and told them exactly what happened and was told that they can't do anything.  WTF? I WAS JUST SCAMMED.

Curiously, I thought i would try to just create a new account. WOW... It worked. WHICH brings me to another thought. Couldn't people with really bad ratings and people who have been scamming people simply do the same thing? Is it possible that some people only have perfect ratings because they work with other people to create listings and pass each other good ratings for imaginary work? Turns out that this is entirely possible. And If I could create more than one account then so can the dead beats who are probably out there giving themselves great ratings.

Here is the transcription of my message sent to valerie: Hello Valerie,        I am a freelancer on your site, and have completed my first project and currently doing second. My first project got me, $48.00, you guys deducted your commission, so i was left with $43.20. Applied for currency conversion from dollar to rupee, So, $43.20 becomes 2381.62 (55.13 being the exchange rate), infact the USD to Rupee conversion should have 57.60 as on that day, $1=57.60. Then, i realized, is have only have one source, through which i can be get my funds, i.e., PAYPAL. So, again applied for currency conversion and now 2381.62 becomes $38.99. Therefore, $43.20 becomes $38.99 inshort. Then, i tried to withdraw my remaining funds, after paypal charges of $1 i can now withdraw, $37.99 above your minimum limit of $35. But, then you showed me STATUS DELAYED (for funds withdrawal). So, i had to google, to make out whether you are a SCAM or what? From the reviews site, i got your email ID and you promised to help some of them, so i have come to you directly to help me. my questions are: 1. How can you convert $1=55.13 when the actual currency conversion rate on that day was $1=57.60 2. $43.20 becomes 2381.62 and then, 2381.62 becomes $38.99. How come, there is separate currency rates for transactions on same day. 3. Why wasn't i allowed to withdraw $37.99, more than your minimum limit of $35. 4. Now, you have charged me $5 for the current project although the milestone requested is $11.25 (should have deducted $1.125) for the second project, and now i cannot withdraw my funds because the funds i have are lower than $35. 5. How can i after facing payment issues with my first project and reading your reviews and other articles on internet, be assured that i would get my money for the hardwork i have put in. P.S. I am student, who is doing Chartered Accountant, doing freelancing to make my ends meet. I have to take care of my education and ends, as i lost my father 2 years back. I have been registered on teacherspayteachers.com and have been writing lessons for kindergarten student, so i can earn more money, haven't faced any difficulties with them for 2 months.  It would be kind of you if you can come out with me some honest reply. Please.",1,freelancer.com
1174,"I posted a project (data collection from a wiki 10k lines), found a freelancer that was very confident that he could complete it in less than a day. After awarding him the project he gave me a sample set of data, the data looked good. About an hour later he said ""done"", I was amazed. I sampled the data he gave me (about 2% of it) and it all appeared to be valid. I released the milestone of the full amount of money (here's what I did wrong). I then realized that the data was copied and pasted over and over and that he only delivered a small section of the data that the project required. After asking him about it, I got a response ""I'll look at it when I get home""... Fast forward 3 days of me trying to contact the freelancer with no response, I contact freelancer.com support to see if they can do anything about it, they say no. I put in a dispute with paypal because ""not recieving the goods or services that you purchased"" is a valid reason for a dispute. This instantly locks my freelancer.com account. I then post a review about the person and the situation he put me in. He appears all of a sudden, starting to blackmail me that I better remove the poor rating, or he'll have my account deleted. But if I do remove the rating, he'll actually give me the completed project data. I refused to be blackmailed and agreed that if I got the project data completed I would cancel the paypal dispute. Nothing came out of this, he is still sending me verbally abusive and harassing messages. So I contacted Freelancer.com support to see if they could intervene in the verbal abuse and harassment and was told that they don't have access to private messages and there's no way to block anyone. This may be a $70 life lesson to do more research on a site before you invest time or money into it. I'm left $70 less in my bank account and a project that isn't completed.",1,freelancer.com
1175,"Freelancer.com is a nightmare. They are holding my money for some reason, its error after error trying to withdraw it, numerous tickets to speak to the 'support' team who are incapable of offering support if they get around to answering, often the ticket is just cancelled and i have to go the process again and again. The only emails i get are saying you have placed a ticket (yes i know) none to say if its been answered or not. Over two weeks later, I am at my wits end. There is no phone number to call and that says a lot; a company devoid of professional ethics would need to avoid the onslaught of complaints. They took over the excellent vWorker site half way through a large writing job I was on, hence I am with a company that charges monthly buy offers nothing in return. All other sites do not charge and have great customer support. Avoid this company like the plague, Elance, Interact Media and many others are a better bet for your freelancing needs, as employer or employee. I am uncertain what to do, they have not answered a mail in days, there shows that there is no money in my account (should be $2,500) and that there is no pending withdrawal. Be careful.",1,freelancer.com
1176,"Freelancer.com was a very good website, before it turned into a scam. I had earned around $10K in the past year by working as a freelancer there, and I was very happy with it. However, recently I have been facing many issues with them, and they are refusing to pay the $1500 I have in my account. It seems like scam to me. I am going to describe these problems. 1. They will reverse milestone payments whenever they want, and you cannot do anything about it. I had a milestone reversed two times. First was a $30 one, and another was $40. What it means is that after I have spent some time doing a project for an employer, sending them the job and receiving the money, suddenly freelancer.com decides to take the money you earned back! I understand that probably the employer had used an unauthorized account for making the payment. However, Freelancer.com doesn't provide you with any evidence that the employer used an unauthorized payment source. They don't provide any documents proving that the owner of the payment source had asked for a refund. They just ask you to trust them that what they state is true. I did trust them, but I don't anymore, becuase of more issues I had with them recently that sound like scam to me. 2. Removing withdrawal requests! There had been some instances (at least 10 times, all of them in the past 4 months) where they have decided not to process my withdrawal request, and remove it instead! Once, I had my requests got removed for 2 weeks before I could successfully receive the money. I really don't understand what reasonable excuse they could possible have for doing so. Contacting the support in these instances shows they are 0% responsible and helpful for the issues happening for you. The most tangible response I got from their support (I highly doubt that you can actually call it support) is that probably I have mistakenly removed the request. OK, maybe once, but not 10 times! Come on, I have been using this website for at least 8 months and made at least 20 withdrawal requests. All of them were processed flawlessly. How can I believe that suddenly, I'm mistakenly removing most of my withdrawal requests? 3. They will ask you to verify your identity by sending them some documents. I am completely OK with providing them the documents, I understand that they have to review their customers' documents for money laundrying laws. I had my account reviewed 1 year ago. The process went very fast, and my account was verified in less than 24 hours. Cool! But once again, my account was limited 10 days ago, and they asked for the same documents I provided them past year! Exactly the same ones! This is highly unacceptable to me. Didn't they already verify my identity? Didn't they review my documents? I decided to go on and send them the documents. I had all of them at my disposal, except the photo with a verification code, which I had to take again because the code was changed. It's been exactly 10 days since I had uploaded my documents. The message I received after submitting my documents: ""Your submission was successful and is now under review. Your account will remain limited until we can confirm your identity and aim to have this resolved within 48 hours."" I was expecting the process the finish within 2 days, since it was finished in less than 24 hours last time. But I have not yet received any response from them, after 10 days! When 2 days passed, I had created a ticket and asked them when they expect the verification to be finished. Their response: ""Hi ******, Thank you for contacting the Support Team. We appreciate your compliance with our requirements for lifting your account limitation. However, you would really need to refer back to the Verification Center to follow up on your case. Kindly wait for their response. For your convenience, the link to the Verification Center is: https://www.freelancer.com/users/limit-account/verification_center.php Let us know if you have other concerns."" After 5 days, I was really worried about my account, since I had $1.5K there and my account was not yet verified. I created another ticket, and guess what! They have decided not to respond to my ticket, and it was closed after 2 hours! Can you believe it? They didn't respond, and closed the ticket instead! I became suspicious they have became a scam and all of these were to steal my money. I had searched ""freelancer.com scam"" on Google, and as you probably know, there were tons of reviews stating that the company is a scam. :( What I noticed in some reviews was a guy named ""Valerie Scott"" providing an e-mail address, and offering assistance. Great! So I decided to contact him and ask him for assistance. He responded very fast, and I was hopeful that he could help me lifting the limits on my account. However, 4 days has passed since Valerie told me he would look into the issue as soon as possible and inform me. I have replied to his email 3 times in the past 4 days and asking him for updates regarding my issue. But he was not responding anymore..... So this is how all my hope is lost on Freelancer.com, including $1500 I had earned. Freelancer.com used to be a reliable company and a good source of income for me, but not anymore. I don't think that they will every review my documents. It's a 5 minute job, which they couldn't perform in the past 10 days. I am going to move on and not use Freelancer.com anymore. Even if they decide to verify my already verified account and pay me the money I've earned, I'm not wasting my time there anymore because they have proved they are extremely unreliable and I might lose time and money working there. I also recommend everyone to avoid using Freelancer.com, it's no more worth it. I will update this review if I could get my money, but I won't be spending more time contacting their useless support or working for employers anymore.",1,freelancer.com

1178,"I would be very careful using this service. They offer no type of protection against thieves who are out to rip you off. So if you get tricked by a rip off artist on here don't expect Freelancer to do anything about it. They basically told me the only way they can refund the amount that was ripped off from me was if the guy who ripped me off verified the milestones I setup. Why would he verify, let alone even reply if he is ripping me off? He won't. And even with all the verification they need right there at their finger tips they still won't refund the money nor will they take any action against the person who is ripping me and others off.  Make sure you read all the fine print because this site harbors a ton of rip off artists and apparently their policies are setup to protect them, which makes me wonder if freelancer is simply a big rip off as well..

Honestly, I think they award projects just so they can get the fees from the freelancer and rip them off. The first project I was awarded, I was sleep when the award came. I made the bid at 9 p.m. My time and was awarded the project at 2 am my time. I woke up and accepted the project at 6 am. They say you have 36 hours to accept the project it only took me four. The project got reposted and they chose another developer in that after they chose me on the first post. I contacted support and they just said sorry, no refunds talk with your employer. I talked to them and they didn't do anything. I said okay, lesson learned....never had an experience like this with scriptlance.com. It was a bad first impression with the but I decided to give them another chance. I was awarded another $30 project. I accepted the project and of course they took their fee right away.

1213,"This is actually the worst out of all the freelance sites! They have a very very bad payment system set up where you put money in escrow/milestone until the the person is done with the project. The problem is, if the person never completes the project and never logs in to their profile again, you money will sit in escrow and it cannot be removed until the other person cancels the project! This means you have to file a dispute and then pay for arbitration if nothing happens after that. That on top of the fees you lose for posting and awarding a project are ridiculous. This website is a joke and basically a cash cow for the people who are running it because they make their money off fees and stupid $#*! like that!

They are thieves with bad customer support, who always lie and even they don't know what exactly is going on with your account. I loaded funds from my payoneer account to freelancer.com, I also received a dispute resolution payment from my client, I converted it into USD and tried to withdraw funds, I received email with due date of withdrawal and after 2 days the request vanished from their site. After making another request, the same thing happened after 2 days. I contacted the Liars, initially they said 'The client doesn't have phone verification' so the funds can be transferred. After telling them its not my job to get the phone verified. They sent me another email that my funds will be refunded soon. Then after 3 days I again asked for my payment they said ""Funds won't be transferred, as we only pay for earnings not Deposited Funds"" I got really upset. That its my MONEY which I transferred from Payoneer.com to Freelancer. The client also approved my disputed payment it got transferred to my account and now these Thieves aren't giving me my money. Even the FUNDS I got transferred which has nothing to do with this LIARS they are not giving it back... I want to know what other sites I can complain about them, give review and get JUSTICE...

They always refer you to another department, team, etc. Why me as a customer should care about their company's internal structure? Why I cannot just receive clear explanation.

1223,"I used Freelancer.com for the first time a couple of days ago and yesterday I selected a freelancer. (On the day of registration Freelancer took a $10 deposit from me). The successful bid was $100 and the milestone was $100, so basically the freelancer wanted the full amount upfront. When I paid the milestone their system took *two* payments: one for $97.54 and the other for $102.66. I was logged into my email account at the time and got Paypal email alerts within seconds of making the milestone payment showing these two sums. I was completely shocked I was flabbergasted that they took money automatically from my Paypal account (I soon read on the internet that Freelancer take money without notifying people by email that they have supposedly signed them up for ""pre-approved"" billing). This would not have mattered so much *if* their system had not taken two payments. I read on the internet of someone else this has happened to: their payment was duplicated *and* support tried to tell them they must have done something wrong their end. That's what happened to me. I know I definitely didn't press anything twice. http://www.complaintsboard.com/complaints/wingz-florida-c588353.html I got on to support and after alleging wrong doing my end, they basically tried to tell me that the money would be a credit on my account. At that point I admit I started swearing as they said they could not tell me if or when I'd be refunded! I have now contacted Paypal's fraud department and they said they will investigate. I have sent them a few links and intend to put my case on as many warning sites as possible to alert people to this scam company until they refund me.  I managed to get the telephone number of their UK Manager (I'm based in the UK) he was said he'll look into this for me. I wait and see with interest. I would advise you to contact Paypal's Fraud department if you too were signed up to pre-approved payments without your knowledge.  PS - They have now emailed me now and asked me to drop the Paypal dispute so that they can refund me. DO NOT FALL FOR THIS TRAP. I have read on other forums that members did this NEVER saw their money again, because once you drop a Paypal dispute, you cannot reinstate it.

1226,"Am I the only one having complains about this site? No: I personally know many who now Hate this Scam Site. Few years back, Getafreelancer was one of my favorite freelance site. I used to work there every day for years, but then something happened to their Management: I think site was sold to some other company or the Management was given in hands of another company. Whatever, happened, I do know that the CEO was changed and the new guy is a Thief [his name: Matt Barrie aka Matt the Thief]. As this is a big company, therefore they are using complicated techniques to Rip-Off its users. I will mentioned at least two Lies of this site: Freelancer had an Affiliate Program from the very beginning. Years back, All the rules were clearly mentioned and there were no lies. Then Mr. Matt took over, the first thing he did was that: he changed the rules about affiliate earnings without telling the users: Instead of giving commissions [commission = a percentage of fee that freelancer .com earned from the users we refer] to affiliate partners for unlimited time period, they decided to limit it to the first 3 months only. So Am I here just because of this change? No: This is just one issue of many... I also know that they have the right to change their Affiliate Program rules. That is not the problem... The problem starts when the Mr. CEO tries to hide this change from its users. He wants users to think that they will be getting the commissions for Ever but in reality, it has been limited to only 3 months. The main Affiliate Program Page does not mention this change: it says that we will get the commission and it does not mention the real part. There is a Terms of Service Page: Deep down in this page, they have added one line which mentions this change. Why have they not mentioned this important part of their affiliate policy in the Main Affiliate Program Page? Because They are thieves: that is why... I personally had been sending users to their site for so many years. Everyday, I was sending 120 or so Verified/Registered users to their site via mine. If we talk about the total traffic going to their site, that is much higher. Everything was ok till 2009, when I first noticed a drop in my affiliate earnings. I tried to find the reason but as Freelancer was hiding this info deep inside their TOS page, I failed to find the cause of my earnings drop. But then later in 2011, my earnings dropped to almost Zero. This is when I contacted the thieves and also tried to find the reason myself too. Now Here is the most important part: These thieves replied to me telling me that commissions are now given only for 3 months and this change was implemented in 2009. But wait: after 2009, my earnings did decrease but I was still earning from the old users who I had referred. The thieves said that due to a Bug, I was still getting commissions??? The truth is that: they were giving little bit of the commissions to me so that I do not suspect anything and I fail to find their Big Stupid Change. Why did they worry about me? Because at that time, the total number of verified users in their site in 24 hours was around 1200. In this figure, my site was contributing 120 or so users. But then in 2011, they had developed other Scam techniques. Now their site gets much more traffic: verified users everyday are around 2500 or so. SO now they do not need me or other affiliate partners. But Wait: Freelancer is still lying. Their Affiliate Page still does not contain the 3 months limit info. They still want users to advertise their sites all over the internet so that they can get their pockets full of money and in return, they want to give nothing. Why will they not include the 3 months limit info on the main affiliate page? Because they want to rip-off users more and more. Also note that: sometime in 2010 or 2011, for few days, they did add the 3 months limit rule in the affiliate page: but this info was removed after few days. When I contacted their support, their cleverly sugar coated the situation via saying that they have not made any changes in their program since 2009 and then they removed that 3 months limit part from the affiliate page. Now if someone from Freelance reads this rip-off report and decides to prove me wrong, by adding the 3 months limit info in the affiliate program page, this can happen. But for years, they had been hiding it from users: This is just one scam going on at freelancer: they are using sophisticated techniques to scam users: Like their CONTEST Sh*t Thousands of users are working hard to advertise Freelancer all over the world: majority of these users will get NOTHING in the end: by the time they realize what Freelancer is doing, it would be too late. New victims replace the old ones. They are using different kinds of Contests to scam in different ways. But what, if we look at the Traffic Stats of all the freelance sites, then Freelancer stands at the Top? How is this possible? Using their scam techniques, they are using victims to get more the more traffic and earn more for themselves. But note one thing: the most number of Scam Projects are posted at Freelancer... I had been working there for years, I know what I am talking about. There are all types of SCAM buyers at Freelancer. Freelancer Management's obsession about getting more traffic and seeing more projects opened in their site is making this site a garbage freelance site. For example: if there are 1500 projects opened in one day, then may be 1000 of these projects will never end successfully: some of them will be totally useless projects that are opened by scam buyers. They call them Trial Projects.

They held the money and told me to keep talking to them and the freelancer. so i keep taking to them for about 3 months. suddendly i wasnt getting any response anymore for about 5 months. except i kept sending emails which was ignored by both of them. so after 5 months i receive an email saying that the money (over $200) was released to the freelancer for lack of response. Lack of response? come on. i have email every time several times and i even chat with you guys that took us nowhere. i have proof as i send everything through gmail.

1245,"I've used Freelancer.com for more than a couple of years and unfortunately it is one of my least trusting platforms for several reasons. First of all, there's a lot of unwanted micro-transactions going on -- taking a small amount of each credit card you enter in order for ""verification""; a lot of currency conversions during the process of getting credit (usually, it goes through 3 conversions with bad conversion rates that are unavoidable); so many limitations that appear as favorable opportunities behind a payment to the site (ex: tests, not able to bid higher priced projects without a paid-membership, etc.). They should stick to only the commissions they get from projects and the promotions like the other sites, not numerous, petty methods to profit from freelancers. The second reason I cannot recommend the site is because I feel that they are posting fake high budget projects in order to lure freelancers into paying for a premium membership. I think these are fake because these projects do not contain any information (even a job description) and are posted almost every week or so. Lastly, customer service and moderation is very bad. Theres been an issue of a freelancer posting fake projects almost everyday for a prolonged period without ever awarding the projects which I believe is to steal unreleased original musical compositions (either to get inspiration from or to steal outright), but theres been no moderation even after a few of us have reported it.

What if I don't get any projects? I get to spend my money for nothing?! Here's another one. I believe that most employers posting their job offer is a scam. Beware of people posting job offers that their method of payment hasn't been verified. That's the thing about freelancer.com. How come employers can post job offers without their mode of payment not being verified? Here's a personal experience of mine. 2 employers contacted me for a project that they posted. I saw that their mode of payment wasn't verified yet. Employer #1: Told me that I only have to do data entry. Just do a copy typing. It means I have to type everything that I see in an image or pdf file. But first I have to deposit money to be able to get the job. The amount that I will deposit depends on the plan that I am going to work on. Ex: Plan 1 = $25, Plan 2 = $32, Plan 3 = $47 and the last is Plan 4 = $62. I told them that I won't be able to deposit the money until tomorrow. The next day I tried contacting them. Upon emailing them, after clicking send, gmail notified me that the account has been disabled or no longer exists. I tried contacting the employer on freelancer.com's chat, but they didn't reply. BE CAREFUL with this type of people. If you guys are wondering if I made the deposit, my answer is no. :D Employer #2: The employer posted a job with a good pay (upto $750). I made a bid on that job and got the job. The job was, I was supposed to do an data entry. Type everything from a pdf file and save it on MS Word. But when the employer emailed me, the employer just sent an executable file with instructions that I open the file and just type everything I see and click enter. There was no pdf file. Still I open the executable file. All I got is to type the captcha and click enter. The employer will pay me $20 for every 1,000 entries of captcha. What happened to the original offer? (dunno) So if you plan to sign up with freelancer.com, again, ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK! If you do, just be careful when accepting job offers.",2,freelancer.com
1256,"My review is for the company, not the graphic artist I chose for my project. The bid price was $117, $119.99 with Paypal fee. I created one ""milestone"", which is a payment that is made, but withheld from the artist until the customer is satisfied and ""releases"" the project. I happened to check Paypal and found that I had been billed twice- and opened up a dispute for the second charge. I asked the artist why I had been billed twice- he stated that I had created a ""second milestone"" (I did not)- and he cancelled the second one. However, Freelancer never refunded the second charge, so it is still in dispute. Meanwhile, my Freelancer acct is suspended (because I opened a dispute), and I cannot release the project, which means my artist does not get paid and I cannot leave a review for the nice job he did. VERY thankful I used Paypal, so I can get the extra charge refunded. Totally unfair to the artist. And don't get conned into the extra $29 fee for special help, not worth it. I would have used the artist for additional projects, but won't go back to Freelancer again. NO customer service.",2,freelancer.com

1258,"it was easy enough to get a freelancer to take care of a 2 minute code fix, but the moment he was done, he kept badgering me about payment every 7 seconds.. which inadvertently cause a triple billing in the process, and then, you have to go back to the employee to get them to release the ""milestone"".. all of which is extremely confusing to a new user, which I was.. I build websites and yet had a horrible time navigating that site, and ended up triple billed because it looks like you are billing once, and just confirming but you are actually posting multiple payments and milestones for things that don't exist and then you have a credit on the account.. so, it is partly my fault for letting the employee badger me through the payment process so he could have it immediately, but, with professionals this would never happen, in addition, when he realized he needed to release the extra milestone, he tried to force me into giving him a tip for doing so, good ethics.. and of course I didn't, so a 20.00 job, with their fees becomes 25, plus two duplicates, ends up at 60 plus dollars.. their customer service guy was nice enough, but must have been taking several calls at once and when he sorted out about 2 of the issues, he bailed mid chat.. after making me wait all that time he apparently couldn't be put upon to finish the last step with me.. do yourself a huge favor.. don't go near this service.. ugh..",2,freelancer.com

1261,I'm still using freelancer but very very stand-offish. As a somebody with cancer who loves what he has dedicated his life to which is anything programming. I wrote 2 coding tutorials and replied 3 times as the project stated. The employer talked the whole time up till the last reply the project requested. Then he simply disappeared. He has awesome review 5 stars and i filed dispute 3 years ago. never heard anything. i sent invoices and messages. Nothing. I mean it's only $50 but it was my first project ever on freelancer. so i stopped using it for a few years just recently got bored and decided to give it another go. I'm going to wait and see how this progresses. The 2 clients 1 of which i am currently working with seem ok. but the one i have which was a 2 hour job which i completed and delivered the application. tested it and has requested some improvements not in the description of the project. I'll update this review since the employer said about 7am or 8am my time he will get back to me. Still kind of stand offish on top of the fact my first withdraw should have been completed 3 years ago and these reviews kind of made me scared to continue using the site. I wasn't really upset about the $50 but not I am as it seems to be a regular occurrence on this site from these reviews and now i have $155 maybe going to be stuck there for 15 or way more days. Depending on how this goes will make or break me doing business with freelancer anymore. I mean i do freelance work around my area but I wanted to branch out since work is slowing down because not too many ppl in rural pittsburgh need software programming. and i have skills that i do in my freetime just to do. so i figured why not make some extra cash. In short I hope when I return and update this review it is positive and not following suite with the rest of these review.,2,freelancer.com

1269,"UPDATE 3: if you try to take out money that you sent into your freelancer.com-account, it is extremely complicated: I waited two weeks to get the money back, then, suddenly, they told me it was a wrong request what I did and did not explain clearly what they did with the money, but the money simply disappeared from the freelancer-account. Only after filling a support request, I understood that they sent the money to my credit card, and not to my paypal, as I requested, letting me wait a few additional days (added to the already waited 2 weeks!). But when I wanted to take the money out from the freelancer account, there was no option to send it to my credit card, but just an option for paypal. Incredibly stupid! They have complicated internal rules that are not transparent, not easy to understand and not explained in advance. Only when you need a transaction, there are popping out a lot of ""you can do it just like this"" things, and the solution is always to your detriment. Considering they have millions of users, and they delay the payments from their accounts to the outside world for at least a few days, one can imagine what earnings they have just by using this money that is blocked there. They probably are able to use it permanently (in the meantime), like a bank does this too. But freelancer.com is not a bank. UPDATE 2: I tried to use ""envato"" instead of freelancer. It worked very simple, with no unneccessary fuss regarding the payment methods and no hiring bureaucracy. They have even an escrow system, which makes it very secure. All in all it was really pleasant, compared to freelancer. And the costs were not higher (at least in my case). UPDATE1: after being contacted in a very polite manner by another member of the support team, I will give freelancer a second chance. Still, it is difficult to understand the way the user interface works, regarding payments (at least in my case it was so!), and it is of course unpleasant to have to go through such unpleasant discussions with the support, and that only after appealing and making a case out of it, the complaint is accepted and corrected. But, who knows, perhaps it was an exception. Let's hope so. I'll give them a second chance. I will give them two stars more (3 instead of 1) and... let's see. Anyway, I just read another complaint about the guy called David S., which was the same way of total rudeness to another customer:  ""I tried contacting support team through Chat. The Support Executive name is Dave. S and he was very unprofessional, ethic-less, rude and *****. "" *** I just put here below a transcript of the chat I just had with a guy from the helpdesk. You can see yourself how they treat customers. They ask for money for every little financiary step you do (each time some 5 or more), and they have a very bad user interface, which leads you to do mistakes and loose your money. There is no way to reverse wrongly done payments. chat with ""support desk"", which is rather a ""frustrated desk"", heightening the anger of the customer that tries to contact them:  Dave S.: How can I help? Me: I am new here and wanted to release a milestone (start of work) but I payed the whole invoice. Me: How can be this reversed? 19:05Dave S.: What is the ID or the URL of the project related to your concern? 19:06Dave S.: Please provide the information being requested. [! here he starts to be the ""bad guy"" - without any reason !] Me: https://www.freelancer.com/.... Me: the project is just starting, but it is marked ""completed""! nothing was done, I was just requested by the worker I hired, to release the first milestone. (in order for him to start work) Dave S.: This is a Fixed-Price project. Invoices can only be used for Hourly Projects. Well, we do not encourage making upfront payments. The funds that have been released can be reversed once the freelancer contacts us to give their confirmation. We always recommend employers on our site only to release Milestone Payments once the freelancer completes the project and they are satisfied with the submitted work. Me: ok, but I am new here and I was friendly and accepted the proposed solution. AND your system told me absolute bull$#*!, that made me very confused and determined this big error. So how can I get my money back? Dave S.: Freelancer.com does not tolerate abusive language. Dave S.: We have an obligation to conduct our business in accordance with all applicable rules, regulations and laws as we are committed to helping all users act in a way that preserves trust and respect within the site. Dave S.: I suggest that you refrain from sending statements containing abusive language. Me: The worker told me ""he is on his phone and he cannot see anything related to payments on his phone"" and that ""I should not worry"". Dave S.: This serves as your first warning. Me: I am sorry, but I am VERY ANGRY because your system gives contradictory advices! AND I Hope that ""customer friendliness"" includes to accept that I am really angry and have a lot of trouble because your USER INTERFACE is bad.  Dave S.: Further violation will result in disciplinary actions. Dave S.: The process on how the payment you released can be returned has already been advised to you. Me: ok, so I am here in the army, or where? I did not say anything wrong about you, I told it about the system. And ""bull$#*!"" is really a usual word in english language, quite mild. I am highly dissapointed about the way there is no customer politeness from the side of ""freelancer""! Dave S.: Your frustration is understandable. However, it is not necessary to use such words. Me: You could say this from the beginning, and not talk to me in this condescendent, totally unfriendly way! Dave S.: You have been warned against using abusive language. Dave S.: I will now have to end this chat session. Dave S.: Feel free to email support@freelancer.com if you'd like to discuss this further. I wanted to tell him that he is really, really a total idiot, but I could not, because he just closed the session! I was already very angry because their site gives you bad and contradictory recommendations when trying to pay someting, and then I was also being degraded to someone who just uses ""abusive language"" instead of being helped.

1273,"For the most part this is a good way to save up some extra money for a wedding. But, misleading posted policies need to be looked into. It states here that after a release is done there is no way for Freelancer to get back the funds. ""Once the Milestone Payment is released there's no way for us to recover the funds. Make sure that the project has been completed and you are satisfied with the results before releasing your pending Milestone Payment. ."" and again here. ""I already released my Milestone Payment, is there a way for me to get my money back? Unfortunately, once the Milestone Payment is released there's no way for us to recover the funds. We suggest that you work with the Freelancer to resolve the situation. "" https://www.freelancer.com/faq/topic.php?code=employers-payments It turns out this is not true. 1) The employer can do a callback on their card after the milestone is paid. -> This is understandably out of the hands of the system because Freelancer cannot control all of the original payment sources in the world. 2) If the employer talks to Freelancer support they can return the funds without providing information to the Freelancer (albeit as a new milestone paid from the Freelancers account). -> This needs to be worked on because it promotes abusive and potentially fraudulent activity on the site. I recently had this happen to me. Freelancer support told me that it was returned because the employer did a callback on their payment method. Freelancer support then moved the funds from my account and added it back as a new milestone for the employer. The employer asked me to do extra works to receive the funds they already had given me, but took back (Freelancer support returned to them). A dispute was started and the Freelancer dispute team decided to give the milestone once paid, but some how returned as a new milestone, back to the employer. Total time working for this employer 20 hours. Originally posted milestones $200 USD. Released milestones $100. Milestone lost in dispute $100 + $5(dispute fee). Released Milestone returned as a new milestone $100. Re-posted milestone lost in dispute $100 + $5 (dispute fee). I received -$10 & - 20 hours. The employer received free work and front end code that they can use anywhere as much as they want.  I am still dumbfounded that I lost the dispute in spite of the fact that the employer is using the code on their publicly viewable site, screenshots, messages from the employer saying ""it looks good"", ""wait why we post it to production"", ""Great job""... Even after I lost they are still using my code free of charge ): The dispute team works in mysterious ways.... But setting this aside.. Why have a policy posted if your own team does not follow it? Why so one sided? Nearly no information was provided to me, and when it was it was an inquisition. Support: ""Please provide evidence that the employer was satisfied with the work you've done and that it's completed"" Me: ""They released the milestone! Why would they do that unless they were happy with the work?"" -> Really? The employer should be asked why they released the milestone if they were not satisfied. If they have a really good reason like ""I accidentally pushed the button"". ""Someone has hacked into my account."" etc, a refund may be in order. In other cases the support team should not even attempt to contact the freelancer for evidence of ""satisfaction"" when the employer pushed a button. This is a loaded question biased in favor of the employer.  De facto policy: ""Once the Milestone Payment is released there are ways for us to recover the funds."" [UPDATE 2016-01-29] After discussing this with support they clarified that they returned the milestone from released to pending. It was not due to employer payment issues. I hope they let management know that they should change the policy posted on the site. To let users know that milestone payments can in fact be returned to the Employer after they are released. They may get more projects posted by having this corrected information. So in practice anyone can post a project with milestones set up like this and get work done for free. Milestone 1: Prototype Milestone 2: Second working copy Milestone 3: Last milestone You can then release 1 & 2 to keep the Freelancer working. At the end you can ask for whatever you want. New additions, extra functions, why not create a whole new code set for the Freelancer to work on? (this is what happened to me). And by not releasing Milestone three you go into arbitration. Since their is no complete version by the employers definition, and by clever manipulation (for example stalling the project over the deadline by simply not messaging the freelancer for a few weeks), you can ensure that you win. After winning your arbitration you can ask Freelancer to return all of the funds, even milestones that were released previously. Based on a process that is not stated on the site you will be refunded and left with the product FREE of charge. Who knows how this refund process is decided. I have a few guesses. But it is certainly not written on the site. 1) the employer and support team are from the same country 2) the employer complains enough to where support just wants them to close the issue ASAP. 3) Someone in support thinks that breaking the written policy on the site, is a good idea in this case. 4) Someone in support thinks that giving the case to the dispute team is a better idea than just telling the employer ""No. It can't be done! Released milestone cannot be retrieved as posted on the site"". I think (4) happened in my case and it should be brought to the attention of management. I am keen to see this issue resolved to make Freelancer more secure for, well, freelancers.",2,freelancer.com

1275,I was looking for my web project for a site and came by Freelancer.com. I went through it and notice there were quite some projects . So I made an account and added my project. So far so good but then we I add my cc for validations problems started. CC was validated but the money for the project milestone was refused. After several attempts freelancer support desk contacted me and advise that my bank refused the transaction. So in order not to slow the project I chose for wire transfer in Europe. I copy the data show in freelancer description and did the wire transfer. This was my biggest mistake. Couple hours later my Bank fraud division called me that there were several attempts from an suspicious company to collect money from my cc. I told them that I did tried to do the transition myself but figured that there must be something wrong with the site as I never had it before that my back is blocking my transactions. So I got worried regarding my transaction and contacted Freelancer on the wire transfer. They asked me for print screens and data but also after remainders they did not respond. I have check with my bank and they advise that the money has been received by the bank in Germany so it should show on my freelancer financial account which is not the case. I must say that the freelancers on the site look legit and are will to work on the project but freelancer.com is a different story . I have not seen a support desk in years from a proper company that is not responding to finical issues so slow or not at all.

The client accepted my proposal, we had a limited exchange and then she dropped off the face of the earth. Then Freelancer asked for money from me, based on a percentage of what I would have earned on the project. I responded that the project never happened. Their response was that I should have checked whether the client had paid a milestone amount into their account. I checked then, no, no money. I tried to contact her - she said something had gone wrong with Freelancer accepting her payment. I got nowhere with the client or with Freelancer.  It's too bad because I used to pick up a fair amount of work from them - in fact, it was the beginning of a new ghostwriting career. I don't believe it is incompetence or procrastination or anything like that. I believe it is their business model - to create bizarre constraints in the process of obtaining work and payment and then to thumb their noses at you when you complain. It is my view that I owe them nothing because the contract never materialised. I've repeatedly requested that we attempt to resolve this issue and have been resoundingly ignored.

You can register and submit 8 bids per month for free. As with all big freelancing sites, their biggest trouble is with support and high fees. Freelancer has the lowest ratings of all marketplaces, at SiteJabber review site they have got 374 1-star ratings and 26 5-star ratings.

1288,"I worked for an employer last week. He provided the milestone payment (300$). I accepted the project and 30$ commission were deducted from my account. I finished the project and money was released to me. Everything seemed ok, but When trying to withdraw money I got this message: Unfortunately we were unable to process your withdrawal request: Decline reason: Funds originated from an account that is currently under review. I could not believe it since money was deposited in ""my"" freelancer account and I thought that was a done deal. I contacted customer support and: Hello Boris,  Thank you for contacting us back.  We understand your concern about the payment released to you by your previous employer. However, this is part of the verification process and will help avoid issues once you have withdrawn the funds. Note that the employer always has the option to create and release the Milestone Payment. However, there are some instances where we need to make verification to make sure that the payment can be processed well.  As a recommendation for this, we still recommend waiting for them to complete the verification. Note that this is important so they can complete the requirements and for you to process the withdrawal.  If you have more questions, feel free to contact us back. I mean this is horrible.... And how can anyone work under these conditions. Why don't they signal on employers profile that he is not verified? I saw some employees from freelancer offering help in review comments, can anyone from freelancer help me resolve this issue? I would like to continue to use freelancer.com, but if this does not resolve I will never use them again.",2,freelancer.com
1289,"My experience with Freelancer was a few years ago but I can still recall my bewilderment when I found all the unexpected Freelancer fees on my credit card. When I contacted Freelancer (e-mail only) all they told me was that these fees were something I had had supposedly agreed to (to put my job needs up front or on the fast track, etc.) by clicking on one thing or another. I told the Freelancers people that the fees which should have been clearly visible and upfront on their website were all but completely masked by a very confusing set of options and unclear pricing information, which in hindsight I felt might have even been somewhat intentional or at least not designed in the clients' best interest in terms of being clear and simple. For that reason I felt they had failed to provide full disclosure. I came away with the strong impression that the Freelancer site at that time (don't know what it's like now) was more about their bottom line (making money) than it was about making sure clients clearly understood all the fees that would be incurred. I had NO problem with the person who actually did the work (the freelancer himself), in fact I paid him a little extra just to show my appreciation but as for Freelancer.com, they will not be at the top of my list when looking for such a service. You can check out http://alternativeto.net/software/freelancer/ for alternative similar services).

1291,"A SCAM IF I'VE EVER SEEN ONE, AND I MEAN IT. (Explanation below) Earlier, I was attempting to take exams on the site as a means of making myself more attractive to employers. After getting a 98% on my English exam, I decided to try and get a 100%, just because. Well, there are a few problems. 1. All questions are submitted by users when they have made a high enough score on any exam. There is no guarantee the questions are accurate. I've ran into plenty of unanswerable questions ranging from simple spelling errors to flat-out inaccurate questions with wrong answers flagged as correct. There are even questions that technically have no right answer. 2. When reaching the exam screen for an exam you've already taken, there is a hyperlink next to your previous score that says ""Let's beat it!"" At the bottom of the page there is also a buy option for the exam. Click ""Let's beat it!"" takes you directly to your exam to attempt to beat your own score. Just one problem: YOU ARE CHARGED FOR THE EXAM AGAIN, WITHOUT ANY PAGE OR WARNING IN BETWEEN YOU CLICKING THE LINK AND TAKING THE EXAM. I racked up $20 worth of charges before realizing that I was being charged. 3. After realizing this, their support has yet to contact me about their effectively rigged exams AND the money they took from me. There is zero transparency about how the site handles your money, and reviewing the site further, they seem to charge many users with tons of different fees. The moment I receive my payment, I'm removing my personal info, delinking my Paypal, and never looking back. (And should they decide to deny me a refund, I plan on disputing it through Paypal.) I WASN'T EVEN ABLE TO START MAKING MONEY OR EVEN BID ON A PROJECT BEFORE I WAS IN THE RED. Update: After putting in a second ticket, it was effectively thrown out because it had a similar title to a previous ticket I opened, and that thrown out ticket had all of the details about my issue regarding my recent money mishap. The support team member has yet to reply to my email or my new ticket. Still waiting. Second update: Was just officially denied a refund. A bunch of conniving crooks. Third update: In Freelancer's defense, after a few more replies to my tickets, I was eventually given a refund for the exams I was charged for. I am willing to give the site a second chance and will suspend my review until further notice. I will say I like the site layout, so I will be giving the site a second chance, but I tread lightly.",2,freelancer.com

He cancels the project and here's a fragment of the discussion that followed with freelancer.com chat support: [...] 05:18 Rose D: It shows that the project ""Write a script for a live bettering website"" has indeed been cancelled. 05:18 Rose D: What I can do for you is contact your employer ******** about this project if they are still interested in working with you. Would you like me to do so? 05:19 [user]: What?? 05:20 [user]: Why would I want you to do that? 05:20 [user]: The client told me alredy he can not supply the materials required and is thus cancelling. 05:20 [user]: Have you seen my question?

1293,"I have been with Freelancer for a bit now and have had a horrible experience.

1294,"Here it comes, from a 4 year veteran at Freelancer.com! As every of these website Freelancer.com lives from fees taken from employers and employees. I never had anything against this as I understand how these sites work and I was very grateful that they exist. I've been freelancering on other sites as well and had very successful careers, on all of them. With over 400 projects completed (and 400 highly paid projects, not $30 projects with a team to pay) as an individual and a 5 star rating I had it all. Then, the greed started rolling in. Initially they started boosting up the prices and lowering what they offered in return. They started re-doing the website, for the worse, adding new unnecessary features just to attract people to bid on projects. They focused on QUANTITY over QUALITY. The Freelancer.com website turned in a market, a wild chaotic market where you just had to PAY in order to have greater chances to win a project. The prices of the packages rose incredibly fast and the changes from 2 months ago made me quit Freelancer.com, transfer all of my 40+ STANDARD CLIENTS that had opened jobs with me, that paid ~300-400$ per month, each to direct payment via PayPal or to other oursourcing websites. It's drastic how they want to enforce a ""cleaner, professional, bla bla"" website, and how they want to steal money off us like we're stupid and don't notice anything. First of all, if you had the notification e-mail off: YOU WERE NOT NOTIFIED ABOUT ANY CHANGES, so my membership price jumped from ~$50 -> $200 without me knowing. I had a lot of money on the account and didn't even notice at that time, it was just now when I emptied my account that I noticed it authorized PayPal to charge me $200. I was in shock and disbelief, angry and disappointed. I went and disputed, managing to take the last $200 back but not for the previous months that I unknowingly paid. They used to have people ""check your projects"" before they go live, but since they don't want to invest in a better community they're getting ~500 spam projects EVERY DAY and TONS of projects where the users are trying to scam you into paying them via PayPal/Moneybookers. I've been reporting these projects as crazy but they go out after a hour or so, so the scammers have enough time to scam innocent people. All of this could improve by hiring people to check the projects, after 1 month they'd have 50% less projects but they'd have a better community. Is this what they want? NO! They want numbers and numbers only. Well, good luck Freelancer.com, I know I earned a lot using your website and thank you for that, but never again will I or my clients give you money. Sincere regards and best of luck.",2,freelancer.com
1295,"LocalVox Media is a relatively new start-up. I say 'relatively', because they've been around for about 5 years and they have a great idea and a great focus, but what they've ended up with is more of the same. They sell access to an online interface that allows small to mid-size businesses to manage all their social media accounts and their blog from a main directory that is very well-indexed with all the SEO bells and whistles. Sounds great, right? Yes and no. First, a lot of how they attract their clients is through cold calling small businesses and trying to sell them subscriptions, which isn't bad - have to get the word out somehow - but it definitely colors this business more on the customer service/sales side of the tech spectrum. The other thing about this business is their wacky way of hiring writers. The company sells subscriptions that include two articles per month, hand-written by a writer, according to their specifications, for which the client pays $100 p/article (the writer gets $20 per). Writers are treated like short-order cooks in this scenario. If the client doesn't like an article, it can get sent back, for which the writer DOES NOT GET PAID. Or, they can ask for edits, for which the writer DOES NOT GET PAID. I'm a writer, and I've worked for radio and newspapers and have gone through editing processes before, and I don't know what to say about this place, because there is NO PROOFREADING PROCESS. So, if you have grammatical errors, the article is not long enough or there is some other error (especially if the writer is available and can fix it) - THE WRITER DOES NOT GET PAID. To make matters worse, the woman assigning me the work was very uncommunicative, writing me one or two words when she could have been working with me to build a long-term freelance relationship. As such, I often didn't know I was doing anything wrong until invoice day WHEN I WOULD NOT GET PAID! The worst thing is - they are actually not the worse for this kind of writing, only heart-breakingly NORMAL.",2,freelancer.com

1299,"I'm an employer and have contracted about $200,000 in projects over the last 5 years with several Freelance sites. For new users I'd suggest posting/bidding at both freelancer.com and elance.com instead of trying to read all the reviews of single user experiences... it's pretty obvious elance is better after a single bid or job posting in my opinion. If you want my single experience anyway, read on... Problems with freelancer: 1. Poor escrow system. The majority of developers insist on cash up front (""Milestone Released""). I haven't had a dispute so far and don't know why this is the case. 2. Freelancer ""live chat"" is offline more than half the time. When talking with a live chat person, they have been proficient in English, but are limited in what they can do. When trying to resolve something that I thought would be simple, I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told he was too busy. 3. The Freelancer payment system is clunky and confusing. The submission page that gives permission to withdraw from paypal always asks for a lesser amount than what is actually taken (I assume due to fees, but so far I haven't been able to reconcile it). If I am clicking Submit on a form saying $25.00 will be withdrawn from my paypal account, it shouldn't be withdrawing $25.61. I've also had small charges pulled, without warning, from my Paypal account when releasing an escrow payment to the employee. No warning is given that money is about to be withdrawn from my account. 4. I don't know why this is exactly, but when posting a job on Freelancer I get many bids that are copy/paste blurbs of text and huge irrelevant portfolios from people who clearly haven't read the job description. On Elance I get very specific questions, often with relevant portfolio work. I have a large number of reviews and am rated 5.0/5.0 on both sites so am not sure why this is. 5. All of the help and form submission pages on Freelancer could be improved by having an editor or technical writer review them. It's frustrating to spend time trying to find an answer to basic question (like What is the Milestone payment system?), only to discover confusing explanations with poor and inconsistent prose across the site.  All that said, several reviewers on SiteJabber have claimed Freelancer.com is a complete scam. I don't think that is true - in my opinion the owners/management of Freelancer.com have good intentions. I'm writing a negative review, and have been in contact with the Freelancer staff regarding my review, and do not fear of account retribution or anything crazy like that. I've always been able to get any issue or confusion resolved, although so far it's generally been a slower and more annoying process with Freelancer.com versus eLance.

1300,The site has its flaws I probably won't use it again because of the issues and the freelance workers. The workers lie about qualifications just to get you to hire them. Im sure it cant be everyone but its a good number. I would suggest they screen the eligible workers on the site to give more security to the buyers. The customer service through email. is good and they tolerate the complaints though they should since its the consumers. I would give them a 3 out of five only because you can't speak to anyone if you are in the united states or canada which is terrible. Because my trust was destroyed by hiring someone I give a 35 percent chance I will give them another try but you can at you own risk. If they improve these things it will be much better. Just be careful who you hire and ask to see what work they've done before hiring. If not for the customer service being through email and bad service throught the freelancers I'd give this site a 3 and a half,2,freelancer.com

We found Freelancer to be easy to get someone to start the work. Almost impossible to get one to finish it. We have a 95% finished site and can't get them to finish.

They upgrade your profile automatically to one where you have to pay if you don't notice it yourself and downgrade manually (they don't ask). They renewed my project automatically, and then wanted to charge me 5 bucks to close the renewed project I never wanted in the first place. I had trouble paying my designer because my credit card didn't go through. From my end everything was ok, but they just didn't claim the money from visa so it left my designer hanging for a long time. Their payment system was really bad. It never told me whether my card was accepted and whether payments went through. That made me really nervous because I didn't want to pay twice. So I always had to phone up my credit card company to check what was going on. Overall, I got the freelancer I wanted and the work done. But boy, was it a lot of trouble with freelancer.com. I wouldn't be surprised if they go out of business.  The last thing that really annoyed me about the site is that it's so unclear what's going on. The site itself has a terrible design.

When I reach at $1400+ revenue each month and my rating started growing, the freelancer.com started stealing my money each month.  The method: What they do. they post few fake projects by themselves. Workers bid on the projects and they take the %age right away from the worekrs hard earned money. I did the same and a client hired me. I provided him the work and he sent me the payments. After few days when I requested a withdrawal, I noticed that 128$ are less. When I carefully saw my transaction history I found a terrible thing, I saw that freelancer.com has stolen my funds and wrote"" Reverse payment"" in the transaction history. When I contacted them and complaint about this stealing they said sorry and said the client you have worked with has charged back.  When I asked what about my work which I have done and the money he sent was through your ""GUARANTEED"" milestone.. where is your guarantee? They said you should contact to the client directly. And you know what ?? when I went into the past project tab, the project and the client history was deleted from the freelancer.com....!! Yes that's what they do when you grow on the site and be loyal and do not work outside. I am the person who has reported hundreds of projects and the clients who breaches their policies and what I got?? And they started doing this every month. Last month I had a argument with the freelancer.com customer support and warned them against their illegal money stealing habit. And the next morning my account was suspended due to ""SECURITY REASONS"" * I was already a verified user with the verified batch and 20 level. See their joke?? I was already not happy with their system because they do not provide the workers an access to see the client's data at the first place.

We can not provide yo any estimated time. Thus, as an extension of our assistance, a follow up email has been sent to the appropriate team for an update. Rest assured that you will be notified once we receive feedback from them."" *To this date, my case is still ""UNDER REVIEW"" by their genius support team.

Then freelancer.com should take responsibility for payment.

1312,"This review is only obliquely about freelancer. I got an email invitation from them. It has to be because about three weeks ago I was told about elance.com and signed up there. I had completed 90% of their enrollment, all that was left was to send them a pic of my Driver's License and a Skype interview. So glad I didn't give them more sensitive info and I'm glad that I didn't get any jobs (headaches) from them either. All I lost was the time it took to enroll there and take some tests on video production. Then there was the daily looking and bidding for jobs... that never amounted to anything.  So back to Freelancer... I got an email invitation and it came in Italian (I sort of speak Italian, but in no way on a level to do business). Still, before even thinking of clicking on the ""accept invitation"" I wanted to see what others thought of them first, so I ended up here.

I hired a freelancer on the site to design a site for $5000 dollars,(he originally had placed a bid for $3000 dollars then right after said it will actually be $5000) after the freelancer took more than 50% of our money and we only had less than 10 percent of the site competed thus far, the freelancer asked for more money and upon further research we found that he had complaints under his real name for basically building a defective site that wont work . We also found reports from other sites that allegedly freelancer.com freelancers will hire each other for fake projects so they can leave each other fake feedback. I filed a claim with my bank and sent an email to freelancer customer service 5 days ago and have not received a reply back. Needless to say, we feel we have been scammed.",2,freelancer.com
1314,"As a 3 year old freelancer with around 250 projects I can't say I have ""ALL GOOD"" words for them. First of all many of you may think they're scammers but what they're actually is LAME WITH SUPPORT. Their ""online support"" will just use the pre-made asnwers to help you solve issues and if they can't, then they'll just spam a answer like: ""We don't refund, please lodge a ticket, bla bla."" One of my projects is still oppened, it was actually finished over 1 year ago but the system bugged and even though the full payment was made they didn't close the project. When I went to the support site they told me ""We can't do nothing about it"". I contacted the employer (last online 1,5 year ago) and he'll never come back, the project is still open... Now, I've also had issues with employers and employees that you can't leave a negative feedback UNTIL YOU PAY THE FULL AMOUNT, and even then, if they don't leave a feedback for you - YOU STILL CANT SHOW YOUR TRUE OPINION. I did start this reviewing with a 4 star but then I realized that there's a lot of stuff I just remembered and it fell to two, they don't deserve more. Bugs - I found a bug that will let me see all hidden bids (sealed) and they lured me to telling them what's the bug, after that they never contacted me back with any ""thank you"". (The issue was fixed afterwards). I did get contacted from Matt Barie himself (if it wasn't some kind of fake account - seemed legit) asking for my username but never got any thanks. They invented a system that will allow you to earn some credits and use them, OK, but I see some guys having like 2,3 milion credits and when I find them, they have less projects than I do. (BUGGZ EVERYWHERE!) They also fixed another Chat bug after I reporeted it, not say they exploit users to tell them the bugs by organizing contests ""3x $100 for top bugs and suggestions"" and then they just fix all of the reported ones. ALL ABOUT CONNECTIONS - I am a professional Swedish translator, been contacted by an employer at Freelancer.com (from Phillipines) that actually OUTSOURCED the translation of the site - WHAAT? They didn't hire any kind of certified company, they actually decided to outsource this, and since 99% of the support is actually from Phillipines (cheap cheap cheap, bad service) they were able to earn a lot of money from that, offering to pay me a couple of houndreds and getting around a coulpe of thousands of dollars for the project. Bull$#*!! Now, I won't go down to 1 star because there's still something good there but, this is the lowest and most realistic. It wouldn't be hard for them to earn good reviews here, they just pay a couple of Indian data entry guys and IT'S DONE! Play smart with them, you can earn money, but don't expect much, they're not so professional as, let's say Elance.com and oDesk.com (MUCH BETTER ARE THESE TWO) Regards!",2,freelancer.com

1316,"I have the same bad experience as a lot of other users. I signed a Paypal billing agreement to pay a worker I hired through freelancer.com. And now, more than 1 year later, they all of a sudden started to automatically charge my Paypal account for a paid membership I never asked for. I have not used my account for over a year and now they start stealing my money by abusing the billing agreement.  Over a year ago I found a great coder and a great designer through freelancer.com and I was a happy customer. Until this happened! So be warned before you sign a billing agreement with them!",2,freelancer.com
1317,"Working in Freelancer for over a year now... Earlier it used to be good, good projects, not much fake stuffs and minimal scammers.  There also used to be even better places to work for like Scriptlance, VWorker, etc. But God cursed us freelancers by supporting Freelancer.com too much for that. And as a result what happened is they acquired Scriptlance and VWorker (hence closing 2 amazing portals from where we used to get jobs) and then make a huge mess of everything. Ever since then, Freelancer.com has COMPLETELY (I repeat, COMPLETELY) worked for maximizing their profits without caring about the professional side of the work. They DO NOT value the work which the site is intended for. Recently I saw they even added a button called ""Post a Project like this"" next to all projects posted on Freelancer.com. I do not find any Logical reason behind this button when there already is one button to do that, right on the Top Menu. Secondly (the most important point), there are over 80% scammers on Freelancer.com. And I suspect 50% of them are initiated from Freelancer.com staff only in order to generate revenue by posting fake projects and letting them award. They don't give job after that, project gets aborted and ultimately the fees deducted from the freelancer's account counts as profit for Freelancer.com. I suspect this a lot. Thank god I am a web developer and I don't get as much fake jobs, but I really pity for the content writers on Freelancer. They get almost 95% fake jobs. They hardly get a good opportunity! And I wonder what do the review / moderation stuff do when the project is in review process... Busy throwing pancakes at each other?? Their support services are bull$#*!. Their tickets never ""actually help"" and they always ignore when we try to get deeper into the matter. I mean, what the hell? They already charged us for accepting the project, now if we abort it our profiles will get a negative impression of the ""completion rate"". What then? Freelancer.com has forgot to care about the Freelancers and have become a profit-harvesting demon. They are just after the money, nothing else matters. They are a disgrace in the name of online outsourcing and job seeking. I still continue working for the real platforms like Elance.com, PPH and Odesk.com. They still have lots of amazing jobs to offer and minimal scam. People, beware of Freelancer.com. This is the word from an experienced service provider on Freelancer who have been working since over a year. Things have completely turned upside-down here. Be on high alert...",2,freelancer.com

They just respond like they have a match to play and like they have a target to achieve by responding within 2-3 hours of receiving my questions. Then the response I get on almost all of the tickets is incomplete. Then, I have to have at least two more rounds of emails so that I can get what I need. They truly truly lack proper professional approach and customer support. Imagine if companies were giving support like this in an airplane, or imagine if Apple was giving this kind of support?

Bad user support, slow reply, sometimes they don't even really read your message before replying. The website sometimes is slow, also earlier it was not crossbrowser compatible. Live version of high traffic website to have crossbrowser issues - professionalism??? And latest example, they take your money without asking for your confirmation. They took money from my card without any notification, and also happened from freelancer account. Luckily, it wasnt more than 5$, but i would ADVISE every freelancer or buyer that is using freelancer.com services, not to keep funds on freelancer.com account, or keep their profile connected with their bank card. I've seen much smaller website, that show lot more care about your hardly earned money.",2,freelancer.com

The funds have 'expired' somehow. I look at the statement of account, nothing. I suppose in the fine print they say if I don't log in for 6 months I'll lose the dough, or they'll deduct a monthly service charge or whatever.

1328,"I just signed up at freelancer.com (as a client) and as a bonus for posting my first project as a client, freelancer.com provided me a complementary recruiter service on the project. Unfortunately the recruiter - Timothy R. - just tried to sell me up on additional services. After I have told him that I would like to wait and see if I can find a freelancer for my project first he asked me to stay online for a few hours. I did this and since then he appeared ""out of office"". This is not even worth one star.  After contacting the support I had a chat with Kayla B.. She escalated the issue and now we will se how things are going. Her help was a ok experience. As the case is still open I can not give any final feedback so far but truly hope that my experience with freelancer.com is getting better and not worse. Edit #1: Two days have passed and no one from freelancer.com contacted me about the recruiter issue. Will keep this updated. So far would not recommend to use their services Edit #2: After 6 days the ""recruiter"" from freelancer.com contacted me with the following message:  ""Hi thereThe success of your project solely lies in your consistent communication with the freelancer. I encourage you to have a quick chat with them so you can check if they have additional questions regarding the project. Let me know how this goes."" Not one word on the issues or why he (or ""it"" as I believe it is a bad programmed chatbot) was staying silent for a week. Also I have now two tickets at freelancer.com that are not solved and are not assigned to anyone. If you want to have a bad experience in terms of customer support and unreliable services as a client - go for it. Edit #3: Today I had a quick chat with the team lead of the recruiter department discussing what went wrong. Even though there is nothing that can be changed in terms of the experience they have promised to improve this area to avoid that other users are having the same negative experience.

I can't retract this review though because this is the 2nd time support has told me they couldn't refund and it's taken a bad review or taking that extra step to receive money back. Thanks to the member of staff who has taken care of this for me though. *Update: October 24th 2017 Recently advised that the fee refund was a ""one-time"" deal. So this company's policies are truly broken and preying on the necessity for freelancers to seek employment and making it more or less a gamble. I did everything in my power to ensure my client was happy before being awarded the job, and once awarded and I accepted it, my fee was deducted and the client shortly after cancelled leaving me with lost time and earnings. This is a serious issue, no money should be taken until funding is secured from the client. I not see that any real service being truly rendered. **update: October 24th 2017 Yet again was awarded a job after providing a very time extensive demo for the prospective client. They approved the demo and asked me to extend it. I was awarded job. Charged fee. I delivered the updated work as scheduled and they immediately cancelled job with no explanation leaving me out of time and pocket. I'm hoping someone from the Freelance team and address this updated review.  **Update September 2017 After addressing this issue through TrustPilot, I was able to contact Freelancer again and am now in the process of obtaining a refund. I shall leave this review on here as initially I was told this was not possible, but I do want to extend my thanks to the team member who dealt with this since my post on here! 2016 I used Freelancer for approximately a year or so. I was awarded one job on it when I initially started out which kept me using it. I was awarded a job for $1000. Freelancer immediately took $50 fee from me as the contractor and the client was not to be heard of again. Freelancer does not vet nor require client details, nor request funding of a project prior to taking their fees from the contractors, meaning you can lose out big time. You will not be reimbursed as per their terms. This company is a sham.",3,freelancer.com

He didn't communicate, did work he wasn't supposed to do and didn't do any work within the scope of the project. Again chat support came to the rescue, advising me how to properly make a dispute and I got the milestone money back the same day.

Choosing the right freelancer for the job is tough. You put in skills and exact description what you need done. Chat with freelancer. Yes I have read and can do this. Next minute they say this is a low budget and request more money, or they ask you to release milestone before they start. Majority just want to be awarded the job regardless if they know what they are doing or not. This is a BIG problem! Majority don't follow instructions. One freelancer wiped out an entire site with a canned demo and I had to restore from backup. Opened a dispute and they asked why did you open a dispute? I give all freelancers a chance. When communications is poor and they don't follow instructions I file a dispute. Feel Freelancer.com should not fool around. When a dispute is filed and communication shows evidence of complaint they should refund milestone and terminate freelancer. NO freelancer should be able to open an account without being verified. Finding allot of fake users. Like Craigslist it's win loose or draw. Best to do the work yourself and only use freelancers you have used in the past you can trust.

1386,"I have serious concern . I made a dispute request https://www.freelancer.com/dispute/disputestage.php?id=227116 Employer as shared ZERO Evidence of his claims yet he has won . Now the employer also can leave incomplete project (which will be 1st incomplete project ) . The project is completed successfully . But i dont understand why the freelancer team has not favored us.  What's the point of having a dispute team if they dont even look at the evidence given ??? So this means any employer after project is complete can just write i dont like website without evidence and can win this ???? We lost freelancer dipute fee + project cost . I don't know freelancer team read my comments as i clearly told employer extended the project to more than 2 months and dint pay us . But the dispute team has given me the reason ""A. The project is all about building a life coaching website for the buyer. Both of them agreed that the project would cost $500 USD, and it should be finished within 5 days[1]."" - [Preeya - The employer clear extended . evidences have been provided for the same.Even employer has confirmed the same ] B. The seller failed to impress the buyer through the design of the website they made[2]. Based upon the conducted investigation, it appears that both of them agreed to opt on the first option the seller presented, which is creation of a full milestone and it would be released upon the completion of the project[3]. Having that said, the buyer is not compelled to release. - [Preeya - Evidence is provided the site exatly like the site he asked] C. Completion of a Project, means not only completing the project Per Se, but also making sure that the buyer wold be happy and satisfied with the output the seller would submit. - [Preeya - We competed the project . EMPLOYER has not given an specific part what he does like in the website even after asking him several time , Evidences is provided] D. Findings also shows that the buyer did not like with how the website looked and felt[4]. As this is a part of project completion process, the seller should maintain a high quality of communication to avoid misunderstanding. Also, the seller should have chosen to address the buyer's issue on the project, since the satisfaction of their buyer would ensure that they would be compensated; thus, concluding the project properly. - [Preeya - We competed the project . EMPLOYER has not given an specific part what he does like in the website even after asking him several time , Evidences is provided. it was done extacly like sample website he shared . ] E. Milestone payments are ought to be released, in line with the buyer's satisfaction on the project outcome. It covers the quality of the project, its adherence to the buyer's preferences, along with the ability of the seller to finish the project within the allotted time frame. Since it was evident that the seller failed to conclude the project properly by fixing the issues on the website[5], it is rightful and just to refund the disputed Milestone Payment to the buyer. - [Preeya - Employer as shared ZERO Evidence . And i have provide all details . How did they conclude this ??] -----------  2 Weeks before this a recruiter porject amount was reversed . The project was closed and milestone was released 4 months back . This was a recruiter project and yet you remove amount from our account with no fault of ours ........

1387,"I've earning from this site from last 8-9 years. It's not bad but now-a-days very worst arbitrator. They suck your money. Very high 10% commission although it's not a issue to pay this high fee, but in return what they pay to you.  Buyer can easily get thousand of dollar job free of cost from you. Even they deposit full amount in milestone. I bet seller can't do anything even they've ""dispute"" system which is actually for ""Buyer"" to get their money back from milestone. Their arbitrator do unfair justice.  I know many buyer complain their money sucked by seller. Believe me seller always in loose their money then you.  Ok come to the point. How to get a job done free at Freelancer.com. For Buyer: 1. Post your job and deposit milestone whatever seller say but don't release the same. 2. For safer side better to deposit minimum amount that you agreed and want to cheat the seller. 3. The moment you get finished job from the seller.. go to the next steps. 4. Mention in the board you're unhappy with the job, even though you or the jobs done as per the project brief, even though initially you agreed the the jobs ok. Later in BIG LETTER"" DISLIKE"" SHOW unhappy and whatever you can do. No need to point what's wrong 5. Don't discuss further with seller and file dispute 6. In dispute systems show you're unhappy, dislike etc. 7. On day 3 pay dispute fee to freelancer i.e. $5. 8. On Day 4 or 5.. You'll see the dispute is in your favor..Seller lost the money. Oh I forget, You also need to post some fake few dollars project before you file the dispute. If you're already did couple of job, then it's more chance then you're winning. There is BIG loop holes in the Freelancer.com. They do unfair justice with the seller, even though seller is right and delivery is 100% ok.  The quote is:  ""Make a circle but it s/b look like a square""  or ""Blue should be more Red"" This is the way freelancer.com arbitrator works. Yes they do unfair practice by ripping seller money.

1388,"I have to admit until I faced with a problem I actually really enjoyed using Freelancer.com. I guess when you get problems and see how they take care of it, that's when you realize if they care about their customer or not. So I've been finding jobs at Freelancer.com and recently I was offered a job specifically to me. But it turned out it was a scam posting and because the budget of the ""job"" was $600 US I was charged $60US by Freelancer.com as a fee. Basically I paid $60 to Freelancer.com to get scammed. I was very upset because, you know nobody likes to be scammed, and money is tight right now. So I contacted customer support and went through live chat. Well this Scott H I talked to was very arrogant and basically they must have this manual to type when someone contacts them. He wasn't helpful at all and all I got was getting annoyed and more upset. Sure the fee I had to pay was mentioned on User agreement that Scott H nicely pointed out. He even said they verify all the job postings but then how I ended up getting an offer of the fake job (And I accepted and lost $60???? ) I am very, very upset and this customer support person made me realize that I can't trust Freelancer.com, and I'm at the point wondering if I should delete my username. I think this could all be prevented if Freelancer.com only charge the fees once the job is completed and money was paid by employer. But I don't think Freelancer.com will change their rules since either we are scammed or not they will get paid anyway.",3,freelancer.com
1389,I started on this site in 2014 December .Since than i made decent money on this site.This site is not scam but have poor management and services .If you will work carefully on this site you can make some good money. 1. don't upgrade to higher membership instantly . Take step by step from lower to higher as you make money and come to know more about site. 2. Don't buy any test to take ( They are useless ) Clients barely see them.But don't miss the opportunity of taking tests when freelancer offer them as free of cost . Happened to me many times . 3. Dont Bid on all projects you see on freelancer . Just bid on verified clients . I do expect that you might miss some new clients but there is less possibility of getting scammed if you choose to work with verified client with 1-2 jobs completed. 4.DONT WORK WITHOUT MILESTONES FUNDED . set up yours milestone and always ask client to release the freelancer fee ( On fixed price projects) before even you start working . which can be 3% to 15% of project cost depends upon your membership . Also on hourly jobs don't work without milestones hours funded . This is very important 99% of the time you save yourself getting scammed from scammer clients . 5. Verify your profile before you start working on this site so save some hassle with site like Withdrawal or dispute process . 6. I do agree that Chat support or ticket support of this site is too poor which need to be improved . 7. For clients kindly hire people with good success rate and on decent price . I guarantee you wont be disappointed with work.Not all freelancer are scammer. There are some serious people. 8. Last but not least try to learn more ways to work on this site if you set yourself up well on this site there are lot of projects and money you can make from this . I wish everybody great success and Wish this site to improve their support.,3,freelancer.com

(I suspect that it's a fake created by freelancer) I was confuse because she seems to didn't know what she wanted, She was asking me what to send me, instead of tell me what she want me to do. when I accepted the project, the girl disappeared and never show up again. freelancer took the fee, the money that I earn from my first project and 48 more from my bank account. and now they said that they will not give me my money back.  update: Finally (one month later), they gave me my money back.",3,freelancer.com

I did 6 and I had a very hard time getting him to create them. Ended up chasing him for payments for more than a month. He gave a million excuses, e.g: waiting for his client, milestone system is down etc, but at the same time asking you to submit more articles to him. Fortunately the Freelancer support team helped me out with this one. Like a sulking kid, he paid me. He told me to give a 5 star review and he will do the same for me. I kept my end of the bargain but he gave me a 1 star review instead (a total sore loser).  I think he has done this to a lot of other Freelancers as well. Avoiding payment then he blackmails them for 5 star reviews. Please be careful with this employer. He has no professionalism whatsoever and will do whatever he can not to pay you. I really think he is just a high school kid with no life. Very immature.  I had a good experience with FL support though so thanks to them as well.",3,freelancer.com
1393,"I used freelancer.com to bid on several different projects and thought I had really begun something promising when Merschen Cord reached out to me and offered the virtual art assistant job, an ongoing project. The initial emails were his offering the project, telling of the way the pay would be ($300 per week paid on each Friday), the work days and times, and working out the instructions for my first task (setting up a website at six.com to showcase his products). I worked for one week to get this website to his approval, then set up merchant accounts (linked to my personal bank account) through square up.com and approval.com. Other than the email contact, I set up an yahoo messenger account that Merschen used to communicate with me on a regular basis. Every now and then he would text my cell phone, telling me he needed me online (outside set work hours) to run a sake through.  By the end of the second week, I continually checked my PayPal account to see if he had transferred my salary, which was the agreement when I began working on his project. However, my pay never came through, in fact no attempt to pay me was ever made. By the third week, I was getting angry and anxious about not getting paid as we had agreed. So, on the third week, I did NO work, but still gave him the opportunity to pay me the salary he owed me ($600.00 by that time), and I allowed him to change the terms of my pay and how I would get paid for the first few months. By my fifth week doing tasks for Merschen Cord, he was telling me a check was being sent to pay me the $900.00 he owed me, this check was supposed to be sent the Wednesday of my fourth work week, then on Monday of my fifth work week, then I was informed I would recieve a check on Wednesday and again on Friday of the same week (work week five). On Monday of the sixth week, I asked if the check had been mailed and again I received a response of ""not yet"". I resigned from my position with Merschen Cord and informed him that I was closing any and all merchant accounts I had created for him, and I was shut the operating website down. I don't make idle threats, so I shut everything I had created for his business down. I also informed him of his outstanding debt of $900.00 for my time, which was for three weeks of salary due. I have been resigned from Merschen Cord's virtual art assistant for three weeks now and still have not been compensated for the work I did, nor the agreed upon salary. WARNING TO ANY AND ALL FREELANCE CONTRACTORS BEING OFFERED WORK FROM MERSCHEN CORD ARTISTRY WORLD OR MERSCHEN CORD: GET A SIGNED, LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT FROM THIS PERSON BEFORE YOU DO OR AGREE TO DO ANY WORK FOR HIM.

Bottom line, I'd say this site is OK as Long as you're really careful about where you click.

Huge number of fake users - they telling they have 16M users but only 100k or 200k are active and reliable freelancers 5. Not allow multi-pal withdrawals- multi pal withdrawals are blocked recently, if 2 or 3 people works on same profile they are worrying about this 6. new users can easily start their freelancer career Suggetions 1. Freelancer.com treats good for their users before 1-2 years ago but now they limiting resources for users and not treats well (i don't know recently management was changed ) 2. My main concern goes with verification process, specially Asian users its hard to follow KYC verification, reasonable numbers of freelancers stay with their parents and they don't have any bills or bank statement under their name, some peoples living under a rented house they don't have a address to verify . and the other problem they facing the documents address formats are not in Australian format so your verification team directly rejecting those. so i think its better to send letter with verification code to users address then they can enter code and verify, lots of sites using this methods. you can see hundreds of users comments https://www.freelancer.com/community/articles/what-is-required-to-become-verified  they really need to verify their account because they are not fake users and worked for years. if they are fake they no need to comment like that they can simply create another profile and do their black operations, this users really need become verify and use their reputation to get projects rather than scape like fake users and create new accounts, your team need consider about their comments. 3.

We are all human I understand, but as a stressed out customer that is about to be $600 down for nothing, I think the helper can skip any efforts at trying to look authoritive and rude, because fact of the matter is, it did not help me as a customer view your company in a positive light.

1596,"Wonderful people at customer support: very bright, high level of understanding, always helpful, extremely fair, including with money the members pay or with the request for refunding - every time a small mistake was made, they immediately refund me the amount, even if it was less than 1$. A very interesting site, which offers the opportunity to extend the career to the international, very interesting clients, a world full of challenges. Quite comfortable to work from home, it cannot be considered a steady income for a family but a nice extra income from time to time. The site needs to improve the points related to the barriers it creates for freelancers: 1. For highly paid projects, they request to have at least 5 reviews from projects you made before, to be able to send an offer to the customer who published the advert. But what happens if you are not a writer who writes 5 articles and is paid 30$/article, but an architect or a consultant, who normally may work only on projects over 1000$? How can you access them if you are not allowed to bid until you reach the 5 reviews? The site should really reconsider its policy, especially that only the customer may appreciate the competence of the freelancer. Also, they should consider that if they apply this unfair policy, the only freelancers who are able to apply for these projects will be the under-competent ones, not the freelancers who really have the necessary competence. I have seen many complex projects requesting, for example, an external auditor or specialized business consultant, where the average technical experience needed was over 10 years in order to complete the project, and the only people who were able to apply due to the Freelancer limitations were .... writers! Obviously, the customers were not able to receive the necessary competence, they selected none, so both the site and the competent freelancers lost the money. Is this a helpful barrier for anyone, including the site? Obviously not! 2. If the customer does not pass through the procedure of identity verification, then even if he paid the project, it is not possible for the freelancer to receive the payment, as it is blocked by the site. Of course, the freelancer cannot verify if the customer passed through the procedure or not. I found myself in this situation, and when I talked to Freelancer customer support they required me to kindly ask the customer who paid to perform the operation. Why? It really was not my business to do this, the site should not permit customers to have a profile or publish a job unless they went through the procedure. This is the legal obligation of the site, not of the freelancer. Why it is involved the freelancer and why the payment from the site to the freelancer depends on it when the freelancer has nothing to do with the legal requests which apply to Freelancer related to verifying its paying customers? 3. There is a very limited space & no. of characters for an offer, it's almost impossible to make an offer to a business in 2 phrases.",4,freelancer.com

I wish freelancer did not take their fee from the employee upfront - and instead took a fee out of the money paid by employer. It seems unfair - and was unclear to me when accepting project. I would suggest putting a secondary accept screen with the charge. Or maybe it was there and I didn't notice - I was completely unaware that the fee would be charged to my account.

1630,"It is a great opportunity for freelancers around the world. I have worked in freelancer for couple of years now. So far the experience good. However we meet various types of clients, some good and few annoying ones. I always keep my customers happy, as providing them a good service.  So far i have enjoyed working in Freelancer.com. But, recently with regard to projects. So are creating fake projects and hiring us, as soon as i accept and asked about their requirement, they have no clue, mostly of them are new to Freelancer. This is bit annoying since i loose my money when accepting this kind of projects.  Rather than this issue, overall it is a very good platform. I have so many very good clients, very nice and easy to work with. They always contact me for their designing work. I never accept jobs outside of Freelancer. Only through Freelancer.  Some clients posts projects for one job and once we accept, they are asking for more work to do. when we refuse, they leave with leaving a bad review/feedback to us. I have only met one such client in my entire freelancer career. It looks ugly in my profile. Out of more than 90 completed projects and reviews all reviews are good except this one and only ugly review. I think Freelancer needs some sort of system to identify these issues.

1636,"It's really not fair that you have a weak situation when it comes to money with the employers. Many times after completing a project the employer takes the money back from the site, and the annoying part is sometimes the employer asks to return his funds because of a problem from the site itself, Also it's not fair that the employer can make a refund easily after he take what he came from. The reason why i'm saying that you don't respect our time because you always return that payment from our money and you don't even return the fee we paid for these projects. Another complain that sometimes you are trying to make a better service but you forget about making an easy service, for the employers or for the freelancers. I understand the security reasons but at least try to make it easy for someone when he has problems on the site to solve it during the support team. Sometimes i don't get right solution to my problem with the support team, they even sometimes don't reply on me.

1638,"I've worked on several different freelancing platforms, of which I prefer Freelancer. It seems to have the most flexibility for both clients and freelancers, as well as the best range of available projects and freelancers. That said, as it continues to grow and expand, not all of the changes are always for the best. For that reason, some of the best freelancers have left the site (and may continue to do so), because sometimes regular work elsewhere (even if just for yourself, of your own site) is better than the hassles of freelance work, even on the best of platforms. In particular, finding good regular clients on the platform can be a struggle for many freelancers, and for employers, finding freelancers who actually hold the skill they say they do can also be difficult. That is likely the case on any platform - but if Freelancer wants to stay the best, they are issues the platform will need to do a better job of addressing.",4,freelancer.com
1639,"As I've been working for short time on this website, it has a lot of opportunity for jobs.

1640,"My experience with Freelancer is overall very positive. It has been my main income source for over 4 years. Helped me a lot to improve my skills, working habits, provided financial security and so on. But, I have noticed that getting job is harder and harder, even for me who was building up reputation several years. Not very satisfied with bidding system, not happy how clients are seeing proposals (only couple per page which is not fair for the majority). I would like for this platform to be more friendly towards all workers, not only top 10 who are placing bids and usually are companies, not individuals. More chances for all people despite their ranking. I wish that everybody can find his own place and have income. This way it is easy for the ones on the top, and a true struggle for beginners, even though they might be as competent for the work, if not more than the top freelancers. Make it more user friendly, simplify design so clients can easier find what they need, make longer list of freelancers display on their page when they need some work, not just few as it is the case at the moment.",4,freelancer.com

1659,"GENERAL On the whole, I find working through freelancer.com, both as freelancer and employer, works well for me. As a freelance photographer, and occasional translator and copywriter, I make a modest secondary income that supports my mainstream work elsewhere, and I use the services of a number of other freelancers, mainly in the software and photographic post-production markets. SUPPORT SERVICES / HELP DESK But when there is a problem, I have found in recent months too many times that the response from the Support Desk has been slow, and because that desk uses people whose first language is not always English, those support staff often miss part of what I am asking and only respond to the part that person understands. Although smaller, Peopleperhour answers every question correctly, and usually much quicker. Although French, Starofservice goes out of its way to understand what I say; (it does help that I speak French). Although Chinese, even Iworku does a better support job than Freelancer most of the time. PROPOSALS AND BIDDING Although it has other faults, one major benefit with Peopleperhour is that I can attach samples of work to my proposals there. I can't do that on Freelancer. I feel that needs to change, at least for higher level membership freelancers like myself. FAKE AND DECEPTIVE PROFILES It is a requirement of Freelancer that if you have a photo of a person as your avatar, then that avatar image must be of the profile owner. That is in site T&Cs. I have drawn Freelancer Support's attention to the fact that there are too many people using someone else's image as their avatar. I use an image of me. Everyone else should do the same. I can supply you with a list of known offenders. Please contact me to do so. CRIMINAL ACTIVITY These are just some of the criminal activities I see coming up on Freelancer every day. By allowing such projects Freelancer is condoning such activity and it has got to stop: - Removal of copyright markers; - Undertaking degree thesis writing for a third party; - Blatant adverts for sex-trafficking, particularly in the Middle East. This is a tiny set of examples. Freelancer has got to get its act together and check EVERY project being posted. CONCLUSION Freelancer is good, but it could be so much better.

1666,"Freelancer.com is helping me work and earn money each month. Lot of projects available but at same time lot of competition from other freelancers. there are some bad things about this site such as they charge high when exchanging currencies, the money withdraw takes few days. Also, there are lot of bad clients who try to make the freelancer work and they never pay him but that not the site mistake, each freelancer should be careful when working with clients that he does not know. But in general, that is a good site where you can find work and earn.",4,freelancer.com
1667,"My experience so far is the complete opposite to most here. If in the future things change i will be back and let you all know. The bad:  I'll start by saying the only thing i dont like about freelancer.com which is that they charge you the 10% of a project at the moment you accept it ....and before getting paid anything by the client that hired you.  About this, two things to mention: -This system of charging 10% upfront is not hidden, so it is your risk if you decide to trust the employer, and also your skills to provide a good service. -one day my fear became true, and five days after (and three days of work approx) accepting a ""big"" project of 500usd, the employer decided she wanted something else (because a missunderstanding about the scope of the project) without paying anything. Thing is, i was able to communicate with them and let them know that i just lost 50usd without earning anything, and they just went and reimbursed them to me as a bonus, which i used to pay for the plan and some fees for another projects. So that would be the opposite of a scam.  The good  Even if is true that there are lots of projects that are paying like...nothing, there are others that pay fairly, and depending the economy of your country, more than fairly. Freelancer.com is not your employer or your father or best friend, is just a platform with lots of employers and freelancers....and as happens in world and life itself, you will find bad, meh, good, very good and excellent people/opportunities.  At the momment i have worked with more than 15 employers, and generally speaking they were polite, they paid fast, some of them gave me a tip ( and of course freelancer will take their 10% of that fee too :O ), they gave me good reviews and i to them.  About the scam badge So far, and in my experience, the site has nothing to do with a scam. What will always be is people trying to scam and/or take advantage of other people ..be it in freelancer, ebay, or wherever. And also there is people trying not to pay freelancer the fee of a project and make ""an arragement"" outside of freelancer and that is also a scam since they are not running the site for charity. Bad clients I had one so far which isnt the one i mentioned before since that was just an unfortunate thing.  The one i say is one that was ok with the work but decided to start to add things here and there all for the same price. When i told him that he should either consider to stop adding stuff or to start to add money, he played the role of the offended and didnt paid anything for a work 100% done. I started a dispute which i won so i was paid. So maybe a too long review here, if everyone would be saying good things about the site i guess i wouldnt even bother to type anything.",4,freelancer.com

1671,"I registered on this site and didn't get any paid jobs yet when i decided to use their free trial upgraded membership. Yeah. Of course, it didn't clearly state anywhere that in a month money will be deducted from my Paypal account by preapproved payment to renew this membership. When i saw this happened, immediately canceled Paypal billing agreement with them, and messaged them asking for refund, which they did give me. But...they didn't send it back to my Paypal, instead just left them on my Freelance account. When i tried to withdraw those money, i found out that minimal withdraw amount is $30! My lovely Elance where i've been working for a while would allow me to withdraw even $1, but not Freelance. UPDATE: I contacted their support once again and asked for a proper refund to the original payment source. And...in a day money was back to my Paypal! It was full refund, even though on my Freelance account i had about a buck eaten up by transaction fees. Honestly i wasn't expecting success at all, so i'm changing my rating from 1/5 to 4/5.

But, happy to mention that after posting a complaint on sitejabber.com, I received my refund (though not to my credit card), within 2 days! Amazing effect!! I'm a free member at freelancer.com. On 12th August 2015 morning, I had bid for a data entry project value $250 and opted for sponsorship @ $10 to be ranked higher. Subsequently, I was placed on top of the bidder's list with 1st rank. I also noticed that $10 was withdrawn from my Credit Card. To my shock, I found that this project disappeared from my dashboard within few minutes!!!! My question is whether it was the employer or freelancer.com that withdrew this project? In either case, why didn't they refund the sponsorship fee they withdrew for a fake project? I sent them a mail on the same day same time when the project disappeared (since I can't raise dispute!), but to date they did not bother to respond! Newcomers, beware!

It is also clearly stated that ""people are bastards"". There are scammers that will take your work and refuse to pay. There are contests, where they won't award a winner and take your idea anyway. It is simple: Work with high rated employers or freelancers, bid on guaranteed contests/projects(the money is deposited already, it's not disappearing), set milestones(as an employer OR a freelancer) and don't budge until those milestones are completed, It may be a hard concept to grasp, so after all that :Don't be stupid.

Here is the kicker: Freelancer sevice thought that too! I reported the scam, presented proof of him breaking several most important rules and opened several cases asking for help. Support was mildly annoyed, very dismissive and generally conveying the message of ""well, tough luck"".  On top of that, I actually had to pay Freelancer AUD 5 for the privilege of working on the project (33% of my prospective payout for the job). The only redeeming thing I came across was Lyndon's support. It was was professional, courteous and very efficient. Simply fantastic and in stark contrast with the rest of the staff. Top job! As you look at the reviews, you might notice that there are very few scores other than 5 and 1. This, I believe, is because the 1s are for the service as a whole, while the 5s are clearly for the support agents who managed to solve some issues and asked for a review. Update: After a month complaining, the project fee (AUD 5) was refunded to me by customer support. Not much in terms of monetary gain, of course, but definitely a sign of goodwill from Freelancer.",5,freelancer.com

Please take care of such employees of yours, he is one of the best employees you have. I appreciate his work and professionalism a lot. Totally recommended. :) I also want to give a short feedback regarding the corporate membership account below and it will be great if you can forward to the relevant team for review for changes in the plan. ""I think while applying for corporate account, creating a new account for the same is not a great idea, it creates lot of confusion and has some bugs like there will be two URLs and two usernames for each account i.e. corporate and personal and the major blunder is when someone want to get the corporate back to personal account, then freelancer.com will ask to end one of the two personal accounts which a user never wanted to have two accounts. So its like you are deliberately asking to get two accounts in the beginning of this program and then in the end, you are asking to shut down your oe of the two (grown up) accounts. This should not be so complicated. You should directly have options to make personal and corporate account option and if a user is not happy with either of the options, you should give the option to convert it into other way round. That is the simple and best idea which will also help freelancer.com to get more people interested in corporate account. I look forward to get a reply from your people regarding the same.

I cannot thank Freelancer.com enough for their support in getting me this far.",5,freelancer.com
5823,"Actually, my freelancing career started through Freelancer only. I slowly built up and today I get many jobs here.  I find a very unique thing at freelancer. The quest for improvement. Its like its DNA. You notice an area of improvement, and after a while you will that change being implemented on the site. Not once, not twice, many a times.  corporate account, chat feature, call feature, multiple language site, payment options,well list is really long. so many things added. The aggression, the pace reflects.  Well, not everything is good. I encountered a few issues too. Comparing them with the benefits, they are not that important. Still..  And the one area perhaps needing focus is support. For standard issues, they are quick and easy to deal with. But the issues where decision making is required, they really are not good enough.  For example- I was awarded a project. Money sent to milestone system by employer. I delivered the job and when i saw the milestone, the money was not there. I came to know that money was funded thru fraud/wrong credit card. and thus milestone sent back. well.. happens. but.. but you deducted project fee on that case. That was doubling my trouble. I worked for a full day for no money, and thereafter i paid fee. and i was not at any fault. In such cases, forget legal aspects, be true and concerned. If so happens in future, I see this place leaping forward only.  Hope my review helps",5,freelancer.com

6015,"The website freelancer.com is designed to make money off of the freelancer mostly with occasional legit projects in between. I think freelancer.com is creating ficticious projects easy enough for people to work on then credits your account and charge you a fee. They then claim the merchant was bad and take away your ""fake"" earnings while still charging you a fee. If you just take a step back and look at the postings you can see that most are basic vague postings.( I grant there are legit projects) but most are really designed for you to ""win"" and charge you a fee. They probably also play this game of taking your hard earned money be claiming bad vendor etc.... Either way its basically a scam site. Unfortunately, it has yet to be fully exposed. In the meantime, you have linked your bank or credit card.

6018,"Hi , i am one of the preferred freelancer on freelancer.com/u/thesmartvmp.html I been working with freelancer.com since an year and i would love to say that ,they are just Awesome, specially their Supports system are prompt , you do not have to email them , you can directly chat with them by log on to https://support.freelancer.com/index.php . Lets talk about the Recruitment Staff {only applicable if you are Preferred freelancer } if you are working nature ,quality of the works are really good and high ratings , you can apply for the preferred freelancer program , once your application has been approved , you will get the projects updates from freelancer.com executives/Representative. i have had done several projects with Marcus,Alejendra , bryndis and Summer , these are among the highly motivated , Love able and skilled staff i ever seen ,Marcus who is one of the best and friendly guy too ,Yes they do laugh sometimes with a professional talk and what is amazing is . if you are able to finish the projects and able to satisfy the clients needs ,you are always on the top race to get the huge amounts of the projects. Generally you have to bid on 30 projects to get the job that worth somewhat 200 USD and its adorable ,so you can daily wake up to getta the work finished that worth 200 $ and you can do it in max 2 days of time. Regarding the Disputes , i m lil bit negative through the site , most of time decision in the favor of the employer even you met the criteria but some time not , this is aviodable , they are few odds employers who come for free stuff and might be they are getting , but if you are strong and delivered the exact work ,you can win dispute too. Nothing to comment on people who around here and filing the false reviews/negative reviews , i must say , you do not have the right skill set to get the job or may be you are not too smart :P lol . Just kidding , trust me spend one month on freelancer.com and Analise the site , take a look at some bid , In the bid proposal you can ask you employer thing like ""i wanted to get started with your task right away , as a noob freelancer over here , getting work is too hard , so i can promise about the deliverable and does not need to have the milestone , pay only after successfully getting the files over here "" BAM !! , if you are too good at work , you will receive the money and good ratings too and YOU START.

The first payment is a little hard, and as some of you said, They will take every chance to delay your payment. But if you did everything right they will pay you on time and with no delay.

Freelancer.com stolen my money by following ways: 1.	Freelancer.com post big amount project and influence to accept it without milestone. When you accept the project the employer will stay unresponsive and they will get deduct large amount as project fee. I lost about thousand dollar in this way. 2.	Freelancer.com reverse earned amount and advice to directly contact with employer to get payment. This is a kind of robbery I lost couple of hundred dollar in this way.

6031,"Hey, I've been using Freelancer.com almost 3 years now, at first you really need to be patient and I know how painful it is to lose something valuable to you. Though negative for others, my experience with Freelancer.com is great, I won several web designing contest, and received my payment in full. Had recent web designing project worth over $500 with no problems at all. Being extra careful pays off. Maybe try these tips, they might help you: 1. First, before accepting a project, make sure the client has a verified payment method and created a milestone so that it will cover the fees that Freelancer.com charges, this will also protect you from being scammed as freelancer.com would be in the middle. 2. Investigate - Don't get too excited when someone finds and hires you (because I don't, I investigate first), don't click that ""ACCEPT"" button yet!!! Investigate first before accepting it. An example would be what mentioned in no.1. 3. Negotiate - Don't be shy, your profile speaks for you (tell the client about your feedbacks and previous projects), this will gain trust of the employer. Ask for milestone payment before accepting the project (explain freelancer.com fees), do a counter offer if you feel like you are doing a tough job and paid less. 4. Regarding contest, I make sure that the contest price is guaranteed. Meaning I get the assurance that I will get paid for it. I also observe the client's behavior when it comes to his judgments in the contest entries, when I see creative designs being rejected (e.g. poorly designed entries chosen instead of quality entries), that's when I back out.

6032,"Contrary to some of the comments below. I have found freelancer.com to be a great marketplace for finding workers with great skills in developing economies. I have used multiple freelancers on a number of projects for web design, creative, Seo and virtual assistant. It's a great portal for connecting with keen, motivated and hungry talent. Like all sites, they're will be problems from time to time - but the responsibility should be on the individuals judgement in finding the right person for your job.",5,freelancer.com
6033,"EDIT: The freelancer support personnel were very helpful and quickly refunded to me the money that had been charged. I was expecting it to be a pain to get assistance after having read earlier reviews; but i personally cannot fault the support they gave. I've been using freelancer on and off for a while with no problems. Today though i found that I had been bumped onto a paid membership and my paypal account had already been charged. At no point did I give them permission to do that, and they sent no email to tell me that they'd done it. My first clue was when the money was deducted from my paypal account. Edit, they got back to me very quickly to offer to refund the charge. I cannot fault their service. The real test will now be whether the money actually makes it back to me. My issue seems a lot smaller than that of the other reviews that I have read but is no less frustrating. This is a devious tactic which I was lucky to have noticed. I have emailed to ask for my money to be returned, but time will tell. Clearly the fact that this is necessary shows that there is something very wrong about the way that they do business.",5,freelancer.com
6034,"I have been with freelancer.com for many years (since vworker time), but actively been working there for the last 10 months or so. They seem to be worried about their commission only. The help desk is taking easy ways out instead of reviewing a matter in a fair and objective way. My personal experience is getting bitter and bitter day by day. An employer is cheating me not paying the major part of the fee (but freelancer had their share already and they are happy and not caring us anymore after), but after reporting this matter and even after several weeks, both the employer and the help desk is not responding. When asked the last time, only then they sent me an email saying I have exchanged my contact details and have completed the transactions outside the freelancer system, so this is not out of their authority. This is insane and gross careless statement. I have not done both, and they can verify this very easily by reading the chat between the employer and me, if they want (I had asked to do so too) My problem was how they could come to such wrong conclusions and be so stupid. I am looking for contact details of higher authorities to report this type of harassing behavior. Because it's now a quoted company, authorities must regulate this kind of injustices as I think.",5,freelancer.com
6035,"Hi I was writing a review yesterday and power fluctuation happened and I could not submit. Got my all money refund for monthly fee and suddenly membership without my prior notice or usage or applying. Anyway I was so surprised to see my money was taken as a monthly account dormant fee ( are we using a bank to use bank balance? ) anyway I was not using freelancer since the day my account was shifted from www.rentacoder.com website with balance 89 usd I reported them account sign up date as anyone could see on my profile. If an account is signed up in 2010or something then how can you do a job in 2006 and onward? which is a big LOL They did not fixed they told they have no option to change ( being e a developer and working as self employed ) I know and people there also know that you can change the date. Anyway I posted the matter again few months back ( as I never knew my amount was being deducted suddenly ) I only got to know a day ago when an email received. Note: In between time period I did not received any alert for payment deduction. Point 4 I was checking their invoices and none of the invoice got opened, it was error error error on each invoice, it was around 5 invoice  Point 5 I was also charged membership fees around 25USD a month which is more than weired, why a membership fee when free account ? more when not using it? Anyway I had only 14.01 usd left hahahahaha I reported them yesterday date 1 June 2014 and without any delays or getting response my money was refunded completely. I was there on website I was getting one by one amount and all the invoices were removed from my account, I have screenshot all this process of invoices and no invoices, amount one by one and also charged amount. Anyway I have received the money back but they still did not fix my account date I have the newsletter says When you signed up on 11th Feb 2010 you were the 404,760th person to join us. Rermember the first project? you started ""TellAFriend/Newsletter Subscribe Form"" back on 14th June 2008? First mistake no one can join after the first project which is almost 2 and half year back LOL And also my first project is wrong I never did that, first project was create 2 login buttons, and the date was May 7, 2006 so what to say? they still can not fix But I am happy that they did refund my all amount around 75USD which is awesome.

6036,"Well... I guess only unhappy users post reviews here, happy users have other stuff to do. I agree freelancer.com does have some issues with payment system. That is - when an employer pays he must complete some verifications before funds become available. But funds show up on receiver account immediately - which I think is incorrect. If I see funds on my balance I must be able to use or withdraw them - as simple as that! If you need verifications then force payers to verify their accounts before they pay, not after! This is just ridiculous. Other then that it's nice and easy to use system, way better then rentacoder/vworker in the past (I am saying that despite I was in rentacoder's top 50 top coder rating). And I am still giving it 5 stars. Freelancer.com is in no way a scam - they refunded my fees many times. Once I lost some $500 as a fee just because I forgot to upgrade to Premium account. They refunded me that money although they didn't have to. Thanks freelancer!",5,freelancer.com
6037,"Hello, I am using Freelancer for almost a year. I have positive experience as a freelancer. I work as illustrator and graphic designer. I just wanted to see what are experiences of other freelance illustrators and designers on Freelancer, so I just googled the ""experiences from Freelancer"". I must say I was surprised to see problems people have. Although, I do see what are they talking about. When I started working on Freelancer I've noticed there are ""suspicious"" projects posted- employers with short/odd briefs, or if they start communication-communications doesn't work. So from this two things- I make some conclusion about employer. Also, I demand from Employer to create the Milestone before I accept the bid-as it only becomes active when I accept the project. From the other side, I see there are freelancer who bid on the project in seconds after the project is posted (i am not sure how).  Regarding employers, I have positive experience. Just a few were ""difficult to deal with"", but no one was fraudster. So I kept 5 star ratings and I am pretty happy. I've continued to work with about 30% clients outside Freelancer.  I also work on Elance. The difference is there are less those ""scam"" projects. But I tend to ignore them. Also, as someone mentioned in his review, freelancers on Elance do read their brief- so there are no this ""quick"" bids.  I am really sorry for bad experiences for both side.",5,freelancer.com

6073,"Hello, my name is Anthony. I'm a 25 year old CEO with a Bachelor's Degree in Sociology and my own global music marketing company. I have been a top ranked seller on Fiverr for over 3 years with close to $70k in sales. When you type in music promotion or music blogs on Fiverr we are the top search result. My business was founded on Fiverr several years ago and I absolutely loved Fiverr. I continued to grow with this company as they evolved and all of our gigs were top rated with thousands of five star reviews.  Fiverr transformed my life in a multitude of ways. I have used the revenue I generated on your platform to travel around the world and pay off student loan and credit card debt. I was very surprised when my account was unexpectedly closed due to what appear to be simple misunderstandings that Fiverr does not seem to want to work with me to rectify. To add to this, Fiverr has no working phone number and the only way I was able to speak with a supervisor was by doing a lot of researching, finding the personal number of an ex-Fiverr employee, calling him at home and getting the contact info for a current employee, there whole system sucks! For a multi-BILLION dollar company you would think they would have a WORKING PHONE NUMBER, but clearly they are only concerned with cutting cost and increasing profit, a business like this is doomed to fail in the future. The owner's are simply way too greedy!!! They jacked the fees up to 20% for buyer's and seller's, meaning they keep 40% of all revenue you generate, this is insane!!! Also, when I reached out to the CEO on Twitter to try to get assistance and explain the issue, he blocked me!!! Anyhow, back to the issue at hand here. My Fiverr account Bosshogg777 was closed about a month and a half ago due to what 'Jay' (head of Fiverr customer support) said was multiple TOS violations, which I firmly do not believe occur as depicted. I've been a freelancer on Fiverr for over 3+ years with over $65,000 in sales. Jay mentioned my account was closed for low quality of service, mis-delivering orders, and multiple chargebacks. To clarify, I was a top ranked seller on Fiverr (#1 in music promotion) for 3+ years with over $65,000 in revenue. If we rendered low quality deliveries or mis-delivered orders, we wouldn't have an average rating of 4.9 stars and have thousands of clients, many of which are repeat clients whom we've developed personal relationships with over the course of several years.  The only time I mis-delivered an order is when the buyer didn't provide the gig requirements in time so I simply sent him a message requesting that the buyer provide the info required so we can complete the gig. I was unaware this is a TOS violation and that you can use the resolution center to request additional time if the buyer doesn't respond or send the gig requirements in time. I didn't know where this feature was located on the site but now I see it has been included with the order. This in itself should not warrant having my account that I built up for years permanently closed. I do take responsibility for this, but in my defense this occurred one time, not multiple times and was simply due to my ignorance which is no excuse, but certainly shouldn't warrant the closure of my account. To further expand on this, Jay said we received 25 chargebacks over the course of 3 years and he said this was solely due to poor quality of services rendered. However, I disagree with this firmly because all of these buyers left 5 star reviews and never mentioned to me or Fiverr that they had an issue with there order or wanted a refund. They engaged in deliberate and intentional fraud in attempt to get services for free. We should NOT be penalized this and there is nothing to substance the claim that the chargebacks were due to low quality of services.  Currently, Fiverr has no system in place to protect buyers from sellers doing chargebacks because you require no in depth level of security, such as requiring a buyer to submit a copy of there driver's license or identification card to verify there identity when they sign up for an account.  Essentially, the only ramification the buyer will face is potentially getting a warning or having there account closed. However, that doesn't suffice and they could simply sign up for a new account and do the same thing again to other sellers. This is a severe vulnerability with your site that should be addressed immediately and I certainly should not be punished for chargebacks due to fraud. In addition, 25 chargebacks on 6,000+ orders is a very LOW percentage, less then 1/2 of 1% of all orders we've completed over 3+ years. I personally do not like chargebacks and I take a loss every time this occurs but it is infrequent and I write it off as part of doing business online. I would like to work with Fiverr on implementing news ways in which we can protect buyers from chargebacks and improve the overall security of the Fiverr marketplace. Does mis-delivering one order because the buyer didn't send the gig requirements in time and having less then 1/2 of 1% of all orders we've result in chargebacks warrant having our top ranked seller account closed? I do not understand the logic behind this decision considering my business was founded on Fiverr and we have generated a tremendous amount of revenue for Fiverr. We have excellent metrics and customer reviews and our revenue has increased greatly every year. All of our gigs have thousands of 5 star reviews, many of which are from repeat clients. We have made nearly $70,000 in sales over 3 years and this number would have continued to increase if our account wasn't closed. Fiverr generates 40% of all revenue from buyer and seller fees. The amount of revenue I've generated for this company from my high sales should be recognized as well as all of my hard work and diligence with delivering orders on time and having excellent reviews and metrics. I do not feel like I am being treated fairly or with respect, nor do I understand why they would want to close my account rather then work with me to rectify any issues. I do appreciate the opportunity to make a new account, which they have reluctantly allowed me to do, but starting from scratch will take years to build back what I have lost. Imagine if someone took away your whole Fiverr business and told you to go found a new company and you lost access to all your clients and revenue. This has also put me in a very bad predicament. I'm a U.S. expat living overseas and I work remotely. I depend on this income to survive. Now all of my credit cards are maxed out and I've missed multiple payments because I've had my livelihood taken away from me. I went from making $3-5k a month to $200-300. It is so bad sometimes I don't sleep at night or wonder how I will pay my rent or buy groceries. I wouldn't wish what happened to me on my worst enemy. In addition, they are preventing me from accessing nearly $2,000 in revenue from sales I've already COMPLETED for 90 days!!! This in itself should be illegal!!! I've taken many losses in life from watching my father pass away suddenly from a massive heart attack when I was 10 years old and having to be the man of the house and raise my younger siblings to watching my mother go through chemotherapy for breast and skin cancer and losing several family members and friends to drugs, violence, and death but I do not feel like I should be punished for simple misunderstandings that can be corrected. This whole thing has turned my world and life as I knew it upside down. I eat, sleep and breathe Fiverr. If you look at the thousands of reviews we've accumulated on ALL of our gigs, you will see I only provided the highest quality of services, hence the thousands of positive reviews, comments, and average rating of 4.9 stars on all of our gigs.  What they have done to me is beyond fathomable. Now I am in the process of pursuing this legally and have an attorney who will ensure they get what they deserve. It should also be noted this company, Fiverr, and it's CEO Micha Kaufman have an F rating with the BBB as well as numerous complaints. #fiverr #michakaufman #bosshogg777  support@fiverr.com  jays@fiverr.com fiverr.com bosshogg777",1,fiverr.com
6074,"Our non profit just purchased a news release distribution from a supposedly United States seller on Fiverr. Here is what we wrote to Fiverr about the seller. There is complete fraud from this seller. I have been on Fiverr for years and no one has scammed the public more than this person. All their supposed outlets are fake, dead twitter accounts, made up newspapers, etc. They give live urls to what they published but it's not attached to anything real. It is like they have these 500 fake links to something they own. They give a link but when you go to any of their outlets it doesn't exist. When I try to ask for the contact information to websites or news outlets they don't have any. They have somehow managed to create a fake similar url and attach it to real live outlets. Many of the background layouts are similar from news site to news site which is impossible. All the still active twitter accounts all started in 2012 and look exactly alike which is impossible to be real. I spent $183.75 which I need refunded to me immediately. Their language doesn't appear to be from the United States. And the more I asked for information the more they said it was my fault if you can believe that. I have put considerable time researching this person's action at a huge cost but I need this refunded now.",1,fiverr.com

Then CUSTOMER SUPPORT basically told me too bad because he is trying to work with me, they did this 3 times with 3 different customer service reps and 3 different emails. Basically demeaning me to grovel and beg for refund. They said it was not an issue about quality but that the job was completed (only because they send email and give you 3 days to respond) yet after completed or really not completed the seller kept trying to fix his incompetence .

People there to take as many jobs as the can and never getting any thing done on time. What you number pay for now its 5 times higher cause they have found way To monetize every single step of a job. The new crowd is rude and sometime outright nasty. If a job is due in 5 days you will hear from the seller in 4 1/2. He/She send you a Piece of crap job Knowing damn well you will reject it so they can get three more days maybe to get it right. If they done ask you to mark it Complete so they wont get a bad rating. Each seller has 2-3 profile and working all them at once.  Watch out for the Networks Scam. They team up and get great rating with high number of Completions perfect scores. It's a fraud.

6089,"Help & Education Center VERY BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THE CLIENT NAMED * Hi, I am going to write you my very bad experience with the client named Hseaton and his current order with me on fiverr. The client gave me a task of JPG to HTML. When I asked him for the PSD files, he said I do not have any PSD files. These JPG files are created programmatically (I would request you to check whether the client has got these these JPGs done by other seller on Fiverr and did not pay for these. This is why the seller did not give him the PSD files). Further, he added you have to work on system-generated screen and I need more colour idea and design more with polished effects. I have done his task and converted JPG to responsive html but he come up with some changes. He wrote me this: ""I would like for you to introduce new design to this. Please consider using different colors, shades, and perhaps shadows? Also, I need the column header, and the icons below it, to be centered. Also, the menu section is too wide. That should be as narrow as possible so we can use the main area to display active information."" I did it accordingly and shared the link with him. He wrote me ""Please make this 'shadow' less dramatic, it looks like you've split the holding element in half. Just make it a little more subtle. If we give you ftp access to the real pages, are you able to go in and re-style this way?"" Just look at the cunningness and dishonestly. Although he has assigned the work on fiverr, he is telling me to do the work on his server. Again, he asked me to add more colours effects and shadows. I followed his instruction and I did it. He was very happy with the work and wrote me ""great. please do the other screen, then we're ready to implement in the actual pages. Thank you!"" He said great work and carry on with the other screens. Cunningly, he asked me to transfer files to his server. I did not reply. Order is running and not completed yet how I will transfer all files to client server? I think he knows how to download the html following the link. I am sure he has done the same and stolen the work in this way. As soon as he was able to do this, he wrote me: ""Actually Samaptiray, this really isn't good enough. all you have done is add some fades and gradients to the design I gave you. We are paying you $150 for more than just that. I need to see a completely different approach. Some actual design. If you cannot do that, we should cancel this job."" He is telling me great work and asking me complete the rest of the screens and later telling me is not good enough for the second part. Just think about the level of dishonesty and cunningness. Most unfortunately, the client is asking to cancel the project every time without any proper reasons. I have changes more than 4 times but he is always telling me to cancel the order without any proper reasons. I think client is totally a dishonest person and when he had seen the html design he download the total html file and now want to cancel the order. He got the file that he wanted. He did not say what he wants in the design. I have invested lots of time in his design and now ready to complete his order but did not get any positive response and cooperation from the client. I am requesting you kindly handle the matter carefully and help me solve it.

I reviewed the order, and I see that you've followed up with the buyer to advise on the revisions made and that they are yet to be responded as they got back to you. We cannot force your buyer to accept the order if they have issues with it, so you will need to persuade the buyer to accept your work, or negotiate for an agreement with your buyer. May I recommend that you draw up a list for the buyer, showing that your work has been fully completed in accordance to their initial work requirements, and let us know how the buyer responds?

I am highly interested in completing the order. Only for this reason, I have done the work more than four times and made several changes according to his needs and guidance. However, I am receiving no positive approach, attempt and co-operation on behalf of the client. He is more interested in canceling the project without any proper reason. In spite of my relentless efforts and requests to write me the design idea what he has in his mind and some samples that he likes the most, he is sharing nothing with me and sticking to his point, ""please cancel the project"". He sent me a cancellation request, writing me this ""I think we do not have agreement on what I need, and it is better to cancel early than continue. The layouts you sent are just copies of our designs - adding purple was not a reasonable solution, it shows that we are just not a good match. Please accept this cancellation and spend time with customers who are more suited to your design style. thank you."" When I am asking him why cancellation- I have done the job exactly as you instructed and you got changes done by me more than 4 times until it fitted his needs, he could not explain the reason why he needs cancellation. The matter of fact is that he got changes several times until he met his requirement. This is why he wrote me ""great. please do the other screen, then we're ready to implement in the actual pages. Thank you!"" I am sure his requirement has been fulfilled and he got html code from from the link that I shared with him. He has downloaded it and copied codes from the view sources. This is why why he is desperate to cancel his order. He did not explain why he needs cancellation.Till now I am ready to do work on the order but he is not telling me what he actually wants. When I have asked him, ""What do you want?"" What design layout in your mind tell me I am ready to do that because we are professional. But the Client is insisting me to cancel the order. Please take some initiatives so that the client cannot go with the work without paying nothing for it. Please think about my hard labor for it. We are here in fiverr to complete an order. However, it is not possible if a client has any bad intention in him. If a client is an honest person and he cooperates us, we can defiantly deliver him a satisfactory work.

Only to get the work free, he does not want to pay me anything. He is a professional scammer. This is why he does not want to reach an agreement.

They are giving 100% support only to the buyers not to the sellers. Buyer can do anything to the seller, he can take work from the seller. and then ask easily for refund and post negative feedback.

Now fiverr introduce new system on ever month they check seller performance if the performance is below 90% is down they are removing his badges. BUT WHY? If you cancellation system is weak and bad, if you dont give rights and power to the seller and you don't have solid agreements while creating order. then why are you removing badges. Buyer can order and he can ask refund even just minutes after order if he change his mind here seller have to pay him back and cancel the order at the same time but fiverr downs the sellers order completion ratings which is 100% BAD thing on fiverr.

Of course we all know that there is a $2 service fee on purchases. How do we know? Because it shows the $2 service fee on the order page! Logical right. You can't charge somebody a fee that they don't know about and are not shown on some sort of order/confirmation page. That's kind of...um...illegal.  So I go to give this guy a $5 tip, click all the way though (the confirmation page looks exactly like the original order page...except NO SERVICE CHARGE ANYWHERE TO BE FOUND). Then you click, they charge your credit card and the next page comes up, showing you the total price for the service, plus the ""tip"". In that total price is ANOTHER $2 service charge that was included in the tip charge but never shown to the user. Of course the strategy of this pathetic company is that nobody will bother to do the math when that page comes up (WHY ARE YOU SHOWING ME A SUMMED TOTAL WITH THE INITIAL PURCHASE PRICE AS A CONFIRMATION PAGE FOR THE TIP I JUST MADE?!).  I send an email to get my $2 back and this guy has the nerve to attach the terms and conditions, which shows that a $2 service fee is payable on any PURCHASE up to $40. A tip is, by definition, not a purchase jack@$$ but nice try.  This is so obviously a deliberate scam. Reeks of a desperate startup looking to inflate revenue.

Fiverr kept insisting I work with the seller whose lack of English skills made the formatting a nightmare because they could not see the positioning errors in text.

6170,"As a buyer, there's so much on offer at fiverr, worth looking around. Message a seller whose gig you like to get an idea as to how quick they respond, and how professional they come across. As a seller, my advice is to stay away from Fiverr, at least read this and some of the other seller experiences, this way you're familiar with the way fiverr operates, which too often just don't make sense.  It's easy to get carried away with the Fiverr Hype about ""doers"" and the freedom of your own business, but what people need to realize is that with fiverr, you're not really running your own business as such, you're basically working for fiverr, they call the shots, make the rules, change them at will, have no accountability back to you or any other of the sellers, there is a complete absence of communication, collaboration, aside from the forum full of fiverr shills - don't dare say anything critical about fiverr, your posts are deleted within seconds, and you blocked. With Fiverr, you are not working for yourself. A buyer places an order with you, makes payment for the order, which is held in escrow by fiverr until you complete and deliver the order, and once accepted as complete by the buyer (or after 3 days if buyers do not respond, and plenty do not), fiverr clears the payment to you, but you need to wait a whopping 14 days to have access to your funds. If you look at the gigs and people featured on the front page of fiverr now, you'll notice the vast majority of them (including myself) are showing up as ""new sellers"" whilst a year or two ago, most would be level 2's with a few ""Top Rated Sellers"", and that's despite many of them (including myself) having been with fiverr for years (I started in 2010). FIverr do absolutely nothing to help and encourage its sellers to upscale and grow their businesses. In fact they do exactly the opposite, by changing rules that directly impact your earnings, implement systems such as the new ranking system, over which you have absolutely no control over. If you look at my fiverr page - www.fiverr.com/activerog - been with fiverr since 2010, earnt near $20'000 so far, although the income is now diminishing as a result of fiverr's seller ranking system which is nothing short of bizarre. In short, fiverr is the only place I've ever heard of where you can work hard, respond quickly to buyer enquiries, deliver quality work on-time all the time, and get review after review that's 5.0, with the occasional 4.9 star reviews like these :  (note the common thread, QUICK delivery, QUICK response). * Very quick to respond, gave me exactly what I wanted and kept it quick and simple. Would recommend! * Fast service. Ordered before I went to bed and woke up with it complete! Used for an intro to an escape room type lesson for my class. My students are going to love it! * Simple and fast * I bought this for a meme video. I'm very happy with the result! Rog created this very quickly and exactly as specified. * Rog is the king. Delivers 100% accuracy every time, and extremely quick. True professional and top lad. I was starting out running my own Adwords banner and buying ad space on meme and gaming sites to promote some of my more funny and novelty gigs and to boost my business volume and build my ranking and reviews. I work in sales and marketing as a marketing consultant to local businesses, and I stress that customer satisfaction is absolutely paramount, they must perceive good value for money, and they must simplify and streamline their business operations to ensure they always deliver on-time. My fiverr business model is very simple, first thing in the morning, I answer all inbound messages, check my notifications, bring up the jobs to be done and complete them, and if during the day any express orders come in, I shoot them at night, then also check messages and notifications before calling it a night. This has been my daily business routine except on holiday mode, and as a result, buyers are initially quite surprised as to the speed of delivery of my orders, hence constant raving good reviews. You'd think fiverr would be right behind me, considering that of every $5 I earn, they take a whopping $1 !?!?!? I invested heavily back into my fiverr business with new LED lighting and semi-professional 4K camera equipment, a $329 Rode noise cancelling, studio microphone, when I reached ""Top Level Seller"" status. I thought I'd springboard this business, as incoming orders were on the increase after I invested in some more banner advertising to promote my gigs (remember, I'm doing the advertising and promoting whilst fiverr is taking $1 out of every $5 I earn, whilst scheming ways to screw their sellers)... Which they did, by finishing and disallowing the category ""Testimonials & Reviews by Actors"", and my income and revenue dropped some 20-25%. Stupid idiots at fiverr aren't realising that I get people asking me in messages ""hey do you do testimonials"", and I say yes, of course. It's just fiverr has removed that category. Without those gigs, my revenue dropped, and I was no longer meeting the requirements to be a ""Top Rated Seller"" anyway. I'm not even sure if that means anything different to being a level 2, you're still being stung for $1 for every $5 you earn, looks cool having that top rated badge though. Anyways, back to Level 2, and I keep doing the same thing. Shooting videos once or twice a day, responding to messages twice a day, and often in-between using the app, responding quickly, delivering on-time, 100% and getting the reviews to back this up. Another month passes, no response from customer support, and I'm demoted to Level 1. Now I'm ""No Level"" - just like a new person that's just signing up as a seller for the very first time, what's really bizarre and weird is when you look at my fiverr gigs, even though I'm a ""New Seller"", you can see thousands of 5.0 star reviews, the odd 4.9, and one review after another raving on about how great this guy is, how he responds so quickly, delivers fast, always on-time, and total satisfaction. It's a similar scenario with other demoted sellers, I don't know what fiverr is trying to achieve on its fiverr.com front page where some gigs are shown and featured. Now it's primarly 'new sellers', most of whom have been here for years, previously being Level 2 and TRS's, now cut back to size with a 7 gigs (services offered) limit (limiting income potential) All I can say is that it's clear to see fiverr is run by a bunch of complete morons who have absolutely no idea how to grow a business, instead doing precisely the opposite, by complicating things, screwing things around, directly impacting the income of its sellers (and in turn also declining THEIR revenue inflows) bizarre! like i said in the beginning, you're not running your own business by being on fiverr. Now I run a t-shirt business on-line on www.tkshirts.tk - that's running my own business, because nobody can change the rules to reduce my income, my website, my marketing, I actually get some marketing support from PayPal. Fiverr gives the website and app, and the whole thing works well, but until about a year ago, it has becoming more difficult and expensive (as far as my banner ad spend, promoting my gigs), and I haven't done any external advertising for my fiverr gigs aside from my own facebook and instagram pages. Before I'd be earning $400+ per month on fiverr, spending $70 to $100 on google and facebook ads promoting my fiverr services, and getting quite a few click-throughs, fiverr should be supportive towards its active and longest-serving members such as myself, not continually mess things up and make it harder and harder to earn a quid.",1,fiverr.com
6171,"Fiverr has had a SERIES of changes over the years... been with them for 4 years now. However they've implemented a new system that will negatively affect all sellers (unless you're processing quite a few orders daily).  For 2018 they've started a new MONTHLY REVIEW of your account activity and they check everything from sales, response time, reviews, income etc. So if you're not making up to the standard they set in sales your account would be automatically demoted and subsequently have to remove any gigs to fit into the new lower category.  I've been Level 2 since maybe 2 months after joining (cant get to Top Seller because that too is controlled manually by Fiverr and they ""know"" who they want and don't) and have well over 200 FIVE STAR reviews. During the last month I received 2 negative reviews not because of poor service but because both customers requested an addition which I couldn't physically perform. So because of something as simple as this they also downgrade your account.  So if you have a perfect record or if you're late with replying to messages, cancel gigs or just don't make enough you can go right back to the beginning as a ""NEW SELLER"". I asked them directly about this and they've indicated that's just how the system is and basically it's up to you to maintain it. Oh and it's basically quite OK for you or your competitors to order gigs and leave negative reviews to get them downgraded too.  I'm sure this new monthly review was just a way for them to push sellers to make more money so FIVERR in turn would have a higher profit... however they failed to realize SIMPLE LOGIC... that if they keep demoting sellers (1) the same sellers would get less sales at a lower level than before and with less gigs, and (2) sellers would seek alternate freelancer site.

This behavior can lead to the suspension or expulsion of students. Fiverr does not allow taking part in such fraudulent activities"". My gig was denied on this basis even though their decision follows a pattern of ignorant assertions. Instead of making unfounded/ridiculous assertions, this staff member should familiarize himself with what IELTS writing preparation really is or ask someone else with half a brain to explain him what it is. The essays written in preparation for the exam are written on random topics and cannot be submitted. At not stage, an essay is written for the student to be submitted as their own, as there is no submission of essays. The students are to be in person at the Exam Centre on the day they are undertaking the exam. The exam centers do not let them know what topic they will be covering on the day. Consultation of materials is strictly forbidden on the day of the exam. There is no fraudulent behaviour on anyone's part as my gig was to correct their written essays, marked them and provide them feedback so that students can improve their knowledge of essay structure and understanding of the marking criteria before their real exam takes place. I don't admit that Fiverr, or anyone else, make defamatory statements on my character, given that I am not doing what they claim I am doing.

Over and over, you will need to have to ask over and over- ""center the formatting on that button"". It will usually take 3-5 times before it gets done. Fun, right? All these web sellers really want to do is just install a default theme and default site, change a few labels, install a plug-in or two and then think that they are done.  Once the deadline starts approaching they will constantly submit their work as complete and ask you to accept it and they will ""give you revisions after"". Sorry but I wasn't born yesterday.

I have a ticket open with them right now for this guy: https://www.fiverr.com/ahmed_islam He literally wrote that he wouldn't work on it any more, insulted me, continues to submit his work as complete, and didn't complete the written terms of his gig.

It's a guarantee that they didn't bother to read what you wrote and won't pay any attention to quality.  The Fiverr review system is a total scam.

So I have a photocopy of the log I like and no files to back it up. THIS SITE IS A JOKE AND SO IS THE SYSTEM IT FOLLOWS. I FEEL SCAMMED. I ONLY PAID $16.00 BUT GOT ZERO FOR MY MONEY.,1,fiverr.com

6197,"I'm going to post more reviews for this site based on the products I buy. Since everyone here is an independent contractor or freelancer like me, I don't think it would be fair for me to judge based on one or two bad services. This particular review is based on the logo design. To be fair, I did not purchase any of their so-called ""vetted"" sellers that they call PRO sellers. These are apparently professionals they hired from all over the world. They charge in the thousands. I don't trust their vetting process and didn't want to spend that much money to discover yet more stolen or mediocre work because of all the bad experiences. I have spent as high as $150. When I paid the lowest price of $5, I received clip art - okay, that's fair, I get what I paid for - right? No, not exactly, it was downloaded probably from Google. I could have done that myself without paying anyone $6 (there is a $1 processing fee tacked on) and waiting two days. That seller had no legal right to sell me something he does not own. This happened to me 3 times for logos I bought from low as $5 to high as $25. When I spent the higher price based on really good description on their gig page, it was the same result. It wasn't stolen stuff they gave me but the work was awful, communication was even worse. The only time they seem to send me messages was when they wanted more money. If I pay them, they disappear until they deliver at the last minute.  The products I received were below average all across the board from everyone I bought from. They only care about getting 5 star reviews and getting as much money from you as possible. If you end up getting a decent logo - google search it because its likely stolen from another designer. If you use a logo that belongs to someone else, it's you who will get sued not the person you hired on Fiverr.",1,fiverr.com
6198,"Every time I've ordered off this site the orders have not been delivered on time or the work has been completely sub-standard. Their customer service is 100% incapable of handling any complaints. As a result, I find it to be, by far, the worst online platform for people seeking freelancers. Shortly after opening an account with Fiverr, I was harassed by one of their members, listed on their account as in Australia (but claimed not to be) who, by making highly inappropriate, provocative and deliberately offensive remarks, seemed to want to highlight that he/she was better than me. I am sure that many of you are forced to deal, from time to time, with this chronic disease called 'tall poppy syndrome'. He or she starting making assertions to the point that, in his/her ill-founded mind, I was misleading people to think that I was the CEO of a large company in Sydney when that is not the case. As if all of the medium and small businesses, that form the largest portion of the Australian corporate marketplace, don't matter. No mention was ever made to the size of my company or to the location of the business itself. I correctly listed myself as the director of my own business in QLD. My first action involved reporting the abusive messages to Fiverr via the appropriate 'abuse button' on their website but the button didn't stop the flow of messages. A message was sent to their ""customer service"" but it took 3 days for them to respond to it. I was so bored with this idiot that I made him/her waste his/her time with one of my students, who took the time to respond to him so that he could practise his English. The final messages sent by this mentally-challenged individual to my student mentioned something to the effect that a) if I was a CEO I would not be wasting my time with him/her and b) my grammar would need to be revised.",1,fiverr.com
6199,"Let me open by saying that I do not* leave negative reviews simply because. When I enter into a contract for business, and that contract is met with professionalism, I give the proper feedback. However, going into Fiverr.com, I was seeking to have work done on one of my many* books. The correct thing I did was look at the fiverr freelancer's options, before contacting them. (80% of them had horrible reviews) I chose the one who had only 1 neutral review. Where I goofed up was, NOT looking at fiverr's reviews overall, which were 98% negative and ALL ACCURATE. I hired a freelancer to do work for me, only to find out in a few days that the task I needed done, was an easy fix. I GOT LUCKY* - Let me type that again, I GOT LUCKY, as the seller / freelancer, agreed to cancel the contract and refund my money. And this* is where things began to get interesting with Fiverr.com.  I could not help but feel that for the work that was being offered on the site, truly professional work*, the sellers were not asking much at all. People, hear me out... YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR... Yet after the cancellation, I had to GO IN again, and request a refund to my Credit Card, from the Customer Support. (Go back and read that again.) That would be like returning something to Walmart, (who entertains FAR MORE clients on a daily basis - and has a QUICK refunding process) and the Customer Service people telling you, ""Oh, well to get your money back for this DEFECTIVE product, you have to go behind the store and talk to the Great Oz, who sits behind a Curtain.""  People - Fiverr ONLY refunds money ONCE*  if that. As far as I read, they will refund your money for a cancellation ONCE - and that is IF - and ONLY IF - the seller agrees to it. IN SHORT.... RUN - LIKE - HELL  from this site!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This time I carefully chose an artist with over 1k decent reviews and I am stuck in the same continually unsatisfactory revisions when I had a deadline 3 days ago. I went to Paypal and filed a complaint asking for my money returned. I won't lose money again. They did not meet the terms of their CUSTOMER.

The reason is a vast majority of Fiverr clients are their own guys who bring lower cost projects from their local markets and post those on Fiverr.

As the consequence of it, they receive negative reviews in many cases. Now if their profiles show the negative reviews posted by the sellers, they will never get any seller in future to get their works done for free. This is why fiverr Fiverr never shows reviews on the buyers profiles. On the other hand, as the sellers profiles display the reviews, they deliver the work for free in the most of the cases. This is only to avoid the negative feedbacks and keep their profile neat and clean.  Clients on the fiverr, being their own people, Fiverr always take buyers side.

6221,"At first I thought Fiverr was a great way to earn extra cash, until I started realizing the many frustrations that come from being a freelancer on Fiverr. First, they take 20% of all your proceeds (which is a lot considering the low prices sellers make). I understand that they need to make money but then they take 20% of your hard earned tips! I have received hundreds of dollars of tips and instead of getting to keep 100%, they take credit for sellers going above and beyond! Next, they charge money for you to just withdraw your earnings. If you try to inquire about anything, their customer support is a joke and they never adequately resolve any issue you bring to them. Second, if you are on vacation (and in some cases do not even have internet access), sellers can still contact you if they are past clients and if you don't respond then your response time gets lowered and buyers are less likely to choose your services. Third, and most frustrating, Fiverr can delete your gigs for absolutely no reason without even discussing it with you first. I had a gig up for 1 whole year, received a fair amount of work and a large amount of money from it (which also means Fiverr received a good amount of money as well), had all 5 star reviews, and Fiverr removed the gig without any warning and just said it was a violation. There are 150 other gigs just like mine but somehow they aren't violations. There is no trust with Fiverr and I don't believe they have seller's interests at heart. They favor the buyer over the seller and treat their sellers like garbage. They don't try to keep their sellers happy and I guarantee they have lost a lot of good sellers because of it.

We went in circles for 9 days and customer service still refused to cancel the order. This was on top of the seller now refusing to communicate with us through its online internal email platform. Good new. Even after customer service said it was against its Terms and Service and that you cant dispute the charges with your credit card, this is 100% False. You can do this, and its your right to do this. We did, and we were able to prove we did not get our product as ordered and the charge was refused. Fiverr can kiss my !@#$. In closing, just like the previous review by ""Chereka R"", the samples of what was provided by th artist was that of a grade 3 student. It was pathetic and a complete joke. I could have copied and pasted something from Google and gotten a better logo design. FINAL WORD: You have been warned. Be very careful when deciding to use this site. You cannot dispute the charge with your credit card if you ""dont like the work"". You can however dispute the charge if you never received the 'completed job"". Two very distinct differences. My advise, go buy photo shop and teach yourself. Stay away from Fiverr. its bound to go to hell. Just give it time.",1,fiverr.com

So I opened a dispute with my Paypal only to receive an email from Fiverr to close my dispute to get my refund...

6242,"Sellers from the third-world countries can choose fiverr if they want to offer charitable or free services to the people of the US and Israel. Fiverr has been designed to take commissions and scam the sellers of Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, China, Nepal, etc. It is very clear to the fiverr management that there are numerous sellers in the third-world countries to work at very lower prices. They are in so badly need of money and job that if they are allowed to get money of the 30% work done for their clients, they will stick to this platform. This is why if they complete 10 jobs, they are allowed to receive the money of only 3 jobs. Fiverr is very clear that sellers will get in touch with them due to their needs. On the other hand, scamming opportunity in Fiveer will encourage the buyers to get their job done for free. This is will increase the number of buyers and help fiveer earn more. This is why buyers profiles do not show reviews. Therefore, the sellers cannot understand the buyers who have already scammed many sellers. On the contrary, sellers profiles show the reviews (posted by the buyers) to help the buyers easily understand a good seller. Out of fear and blackmail for a negative review, a good seller does not like to involved in a quarrel with a buyer- even if he or she is 100% right. Because, he is very clear that the fiverr team always take a buyers side and never ever helps a seller if he or she is from a third-world country. In such a situation, the seller has to give the work for free with a negative review. The most interesting thing is that if a work gets cancelled on fiverr and you dont receive any money for it but you will receive a negative review for it.",1,fiverr.com

I contacted customer support on Fiverr and a girl Vanessa can't even help or doesn't understand that we need to get in contact with the developer. It has been emails back and forth and my website is down and can not be resolved. I paid for something to save money and now that money went to trash cuz I have no website. DO NOT USE THEM.

I received two designs - one which had absolutely nothing at all to do with my company and the other design was in complete contrast to my notes. I brought this to Fiverr's attention and they responded by closing the project meaning I lost my money and the designer got paid for producing complete sh!t.

6246,"I does not matter if you are a buyer or a seller, Fiverr is the WORST place to be - stay away from it at all costs! For sellers: I was with Fiverr since the very beginning (where it was still cool) until my account was disabled for no reason a couple of weeks ago. Sellers beware, your account is at risk at any time, the support does not give a sh** about you and since this ""company"" sits somewhere in Isreal it's nearly impossible to take legal action (not that it would be worth the hassle anyway). To make things even better, all funds on your (for no reason) disabled account are frozen for 90 days and I highly doubt I will see any of that money ever again, even if the 90 days have passed. DO NOT SELL here. You can't make decent profits anyway, because Fiverr is swamped with sellers from 3rd world countries who can throw parties for their whole village once they earn five bucks (four that is after 20% fees). If you are in a western country, you do not want to compete against them, trust me. You're better off working minimum wage for Mc Donalds. They do at least not take 20% fees of your minimum wage, like Fiverr does. For buyers: We'll, there is really only one thing I have to say: You get what you pay for. If you like getting scamed by some third world individuals who will even insult you afterwards - this is the right place for you.",1,fiverr.com

6252,"Fiverr is for the buyers and scammers, not for the sellers. This is why sellers profiles include feedback system and the buyers profiles have no such option. It encourages the buyers to scam more. Before getting started with any buyer, you cannot understand what type of a person he or she is (as it is not reflected through the reviews posted by the buyers) Why Fiverr is scam i)	Fiver is headquartered in Israel (12 HaOmanim St. Tel Aviv, Gush Dan 6789731, Israel) which has no state and obviously the state Attorney General to complaint about the cheating and scamming practices of the fiverr people. Taking this opportunity, a group of American scammers have founded it in Israel. ii)	Fiverr has no rating display system for the buyers. This is why they dont bother a bit about picking up an artificial quarrel with the buyers to get their work done for free. If you complaint to their customer support department, they will tell you to discuss with your buyer and settle the matter. At last they will cancel the job and allow the buyers to go away, taking their commission for the work.   iii)	Take a close look at each job posted on fiverr, you will find that a vast majority of these jobs are fake posting to create an impression that it is a very popular freelancing platform. iv)	Dont do bulk work on fiverr. When you do bulk work on fiverr, a buyer (may be a fiverr people) will approach you with a tantalizing offer. When you get started with it, he/she will pick up a fresh quarrel and inform the matter to the fiverr team. Fiverr team will make your withdrawal option null or disable and at last Fiverr will cancel your profile when all payment get cleared.   v)	In spite of doing all works perfectly (A-Z), buyer and fiverr team can cancel the work with no proper reason and explanation. In that case, you will not receive the money for the work but get a negative review on behalf of the buyer.  vi)	Even after a longer period of time, any buyer (for whom you have worked) can express dissatisfaction about a work and the amount paid for the work will be deducted from your account. If you dont have any balance in your account, your account will show (-) minus balance.  Besides, there are so many disadvantages for the sellers. Fiverr is always against the sellers. Just do work on it and let me know- if anything proves wrong.",1,fiverr.com

I gave him 5 business days to respond and didn't hear anything back until after I submitted a bad review and filed a complaint with fiverr. They sent me a generic response which had nothing to do with my situation. The seller begged and pleaded to have me change the review and promised to finish the job.

6315,I had to report over 100 scammers on fiverr. They claim they're native English speaking copywriters and they reside in the US. 90 % of them are from NIGERIA and the rest are from other countries. Only 1 or 2 out of 100-200 copywriters are actually English speaking. I reported all those to fiverr and told them this is fraud and deception. They suspended my account instead of correcting the fraud!!! Fiver customer reps do never care about any of these. days later I received a canned marketing message. But I have checked the reported profiles weeks after they're still there with misinformation. Immoral people are there. I'm kicked out..!!!,1,fiverr.com
6316,"Now, here's the thing that I felt was bad about Fiverr. Of course they can't always prevent scammers from being on there. However, if you leave a negative review for a seller they have incentive to refund you. This is important. Refunds come in as a request. If you accept, you have ""canceled"" your order and thus can not leave a review because Fiverr treats it as if you never received/paid for the service.  So you'll see all these shady sellers with 5 star ratings and wonder how the world that's possible. Simple. Most people, when presented with the opportunity, take the $5 back rather than paying $5 to leave a review for someone else's benefit. Kinda crappy, right? Fiverr, by design protects scammers. I don't think it's intentional, it doesn't help them to have externally negative reviews of their service (since you won't find them on their site)...But it is nonetheless a thing.",1,fiverr.com

6335,"Gosh! These are really some bad reviews that I was not expecting. However this means I am not alone. Now my experience...  The so-called ""top class logo designer with 5 years experiences"" first started off with a very friendly ""customer service"" and emphasized on providing 100% satisfaction and to hint that it has to be a 5-star review that should be given once the case gets closed. Yet at one point in the beginning, he even closed the case without any mutual agreement. I guess he simply wanted to a NICE record of a fast turnaround. However the first draft looked more that an ENHANCED internet image with the company name. We were expecting, well, more than that quality of course, given the ""impressive profile introduction"" that the designer claimed to be. Naturally we would want changes. We had even added on the changes fee of USD20. Now with the designer's attitude changed completely citing that it is not fair to him to incorporate the color changes and we need to add on another payment. If there was a clear communication right from the start to limit the number of changes, we will gladly abide. But there was nothing said. Sad to say, it feels like being SCAMMED. Now, the designer simply closed the case without our agreement. At the end of the day, he only wants to have the 5-stars reviews published on his profile. This is a dirty trick. I guess there could be genuine designers out there in Fiverr doing REAL PROFESSIONAL work, but it really depends on your luck on who you have picked. With this bad experience, we will NOT be back on Fiverr again. My thoughts, unless you have a real recommendation of a good designer on Fiverr, do not go there and instead go for real professionals and pay a few more bucks to get the value of the work. After all, it's the ARTWORK of your company brand. Do it well. My lesson learned. I wished I'd known better, earlier. Good luck, people! =)",1,fiverr.com

I worked with a very immature translator who questioned me on why I gave him 4 instead of 5 stars. It was as though I had to defend myself. He also EXPECTED a tip, which (of course) disinclined me in doing so. He had numerous mistakes in his translation, didn't deliver my file in the format I had asked for, and then questioned my rating of him. I was actually being GENEROUS in giving him 4 stars.  Then I worked with a designer who was taking my layout, my choice of font, my text, and simply creating a business card in a format that would be print company-friendly. At first, I got a zip file that--when I downloaded it--was identified by my machine as an iTunes file!!!!!!!!!!!! Later, when I received corrected files, I sent them to Moo (an online printer), to have them look at them. They had the ""fiverr"" watermark in them! And, on closer inspection, I noticed that a logo was horizontal on the front of the card, and vertical on the back side. Spacing of the entire text and logo on the back was off, as was spacing between the logo and a line of text.  HERE'S THE KICKER. I offered the so-called designer an out, and she took it. She ""refunded"" my $70. But--and it's a huge but--I don't actually get that money back!!!!! It goes into my ""account,"" to use for future projects, with this company that I've grown to hate.  So there you have it. Oh--they're located in Israel, so you can't contact a state's attorney general, say. I will write some letters, though.

The seller then held my images hostage because I did not give him a perfect 5 stars in all categories (have screenshot), Fiverr cancelled my account in the middle of other gigs (email messages) I have going on. They did not refund me for 2 of the projects that were ongoing. I did not violate the terms and conditions I STATED the options I had for recovery.

No further tickets were answered. I went to my cc company to report a dispute and they filed it. Fiverr answered but did not provide a reasonable answer except to close the dispute with my cc co and to only use fiverr c/s to resolve issue. Which does not work obviously. How ridiculous but true.

6360,"I would like to WARN all of you who desire to work online as a freelancer. No matter how skillful you are. No matter how unique your skills are. No matter how honest and dedicated to your work you are. JUST DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON FIVERR. Two years ago I started my journey on fiverr as a seller.  Experience as a SELLER: I worked 24X7 since the beginning and within 3 months reached their Level 2 band. I had glowing 5 star reviews. Trust me I never bothered any buyer to review me. I was quick in my work and answering them back. I was not a top seller but I had steady sales and happy customers. Problems started after 5 months. By chance I created a gig which was unique on fiverr. Nobody had it. Soon it was getting lots of attention, queries and sales too. It was immediately copied by others. Suddenly one day fiverr cancelled my unique gig without giving any reason. When I contacted support they gave weird reason that enforcement team reported my gig and they cancelled it. I asked them how come their so called enforcement team not reporting other gigs who had copied mine and only reported mine. They did not answer. Then I noticed one of the other copied gigs suddenly gaining lots of reviews overnight. So I understood that fiverr has their own people working as sellers. They just stole my unique idea, cancelled my gig, created same gig to their own seller and increased number of positive reviews for that seller they wanted to highlight. When I questioned about it, they did not answer me anything and guess what, they started rejecting my other gigs one by one. In less than a week they removed my 5 top selling gigs. Further checking the gig analytics I noticed sudden drop in traffic to my remaining gigs. I contacted support for it, again they said my other gigs are not found compliant after being reported by users. Eventually they cancelled all of my gigs by the end of that fateful month and whenever I tried to recreate any gigs they kept canceling it. Finally they deactivated my account too. All this was not enough, here is the worst part. I had not withdrawn my 5 months hard earned money which amounted $12699 due to bank account issue and I didn't have any other mode to withdraw. I never imagined of any problem as I was busy and still happy doing my work so I delayed fixing my bank connectivity issue. They kept all my money too and never bothered to reply my emails. Needless to say all my 6 months of hard work was in vain.  ADVICE For You: Simply AVOID FIVERR. It may help you get little pennies but if you start getting more sales then FIVERR WILL STEAL YOUR IDEAS, MONEY and RUIN you completely.  I hope my unfortunate experience helps you all.",1,fiverr.com

When she was done with the website she emails me to let me know, and what do I see? Someone else's website. I explain to the seller this is not my website. At this point communication became sparse. She says she is going to fix it. March 15 the order was supposed to be completed. March 23 I filed a dispute after giving the seller ample time to complete the order. I also gave her a negative review. I asked her repeatedly for updates, in which I never received it. What happened next was abysmal. I quickly changed the passwords to my websites, but I was on an island and had zero internet connection. She figured out my password to my Gmail, and changed the Gmail account information and recovery email. I was locked out. She then went into my Fiverr account modified the review and gave herself 5 stars. Thankfully Fiverr is looking into the situation and provided me with a refund.

Two hours later, and long after I went to bed, she says I needed to give her the security code emailed to me, which I did. Hours later, she responded, ""it's too late.""

6372,"I recently joined Fiverr, as a buyer. I wanted some illustrations done for my children books, that I had written. I also made some wrong moves, thinking that the sellers are honest and professionals. Two of the sellers on Fiverr, (who also had glowing ratings), are nothing but thieves. They refused to return my manuscripts, which I had also foolishly sent to them, to illustrate. Those two sellers are, 1. an Indian woman (who also used a much younger picture on Fiverr) name ""aparnapandabera"". Avoid this thief at all cost. She is arrogant, rude and unethical. My repeated requests for her to return my mss, were ignored by her. 2. The other seller's name is lunaitme. She is also a thief. She told me that other sellers could have ""copied my manuscripts"", and I am sure that she herself did just that. Both of these sellers has so called positive reviews on Fiverr. I could not leave them a negative review. Please ask for samples of their work and you will see that their actual drawings are so crappy, that even a kindergarten student can draw much better. What they do is to show a lot of vector art on their profile page and their drawing skills are so low, that you will gasp at the actual results. Any system, like Fiverr, that asks you to pay upfront (via credit cards, or paypal,or a Fiverr's account), before the artist actually does the work, is suspect. It is a great mistake, because you don't know how skilled those persons are. Many of them are not. I can do vector art myself and have also done the graphic designs, for my books. I also don't advertised myself as an illustrator, because of that fact. (And I have the books to prove my skills in regards to that fact). I used Fiverr because it is supposed to be cheaper and save you a lot of time. I was wrong. I got quotes for those illustrations, at $550.00. I kid you not. Another thing I find is that I could not sell on Fiverr. I tried to sell and it kept creating all kinds of problems for me. If I tried to type in my writing skills, such as creative writing, Fiverr's stupid system would not let me do that. And last, but not least. NO SERVICE ON FIVERR, IS FOR $5.00. as it claimed. Don't believe me?, then try buying some service on Fiverr and see if you actually pays $5.00, or anything close to that amount. That figure quoted by Fiverr, is to actually get you on to that site, but the rates are nothing close to that. $5.00 is just one tiny part of the cost. If you want the full service, form the seller, then you also be prepared to pay a lot more money. Don't trust certain sellers, like illustrators on Fiverr. They can't draw and uses digital technology, to rip you off.",1,fiverr.com

CreateSpace had to make tons of changes to my file to get it to fit and it still looks bad. It took over a week to get my job done. The designer apparently has a master's degree in design (I'm sure that's fake) because there were so many typos and basic design errors, it took multiple revisions to get it done. And it still wasn't right in the end. The designer was based in Pakistan, so you have to deal with the time difference and language barrier. Avoid this service at all costs.

I started a non profit organization recently, and I am looking to have a logo made. I contacted a seller before hand and gave them an idea of what I wanted. I paid $105 for a logo, and got a 5$ quality logo. I mean total crap. I couldn't believe what I received for what I paid. Seller refused to refund me. She was clever and said, ""If you wish to longer do business with me, then complete the order."" Meaning she will keep my money. She didn't seem to give a damn about her submission of a cheap rushed logo. I feel so undervalued and cheated. She has complete control over my cash and what she submits. If I open a dispute with her on Fiverr, all she does is cancel it. I opened this dispute many more times, but she cancelled them all. I opened dispute asap with Paypal, praying they will judge fairly and give me back my hard earned cash. Don't rely on the ""Top Rated Sellers"" like I did.  There are many other issues that ring true. Any refunds you do get must stay in the Fiverr account. Sellers reviews are probably manipulated. and so much more, but I am exhausted and no longer wish to go in detail. This isn't the first time a seller gave me extremely low quality products for money, but they kindly refunded me. I will no longer risk my money with fiverr.

Not only were the files poorly labeled so that I had to guess which file was specific to which fulfillment requirement, he sent files that wouldn't open in any of my programs and, ignored all of my requests for help. I tried to cancel the order when his reponses started taking so long, but he refused the cancel (apparently sellers have to approve cancellations) and then he complained to me--still not answering my questions-- when I didn't give him a five star review. I contacted Fiverr support, and they continually referred me back to the seller to work it out and asked me to keep them posted. When I finally told them I would be contacting my credit card company to dispute the charge, they did finally send me links to help open some of the files I couldn't access and told me I would be restricted from their site if I disputed the charge. Why those links weren't sent to me right away--and put on the website along with the files--is something they will work out for themselves, I suppose, if they want to run an internet business that has any kind of customer support.

6380,"Fivrr seems to make a promise on which it does not deliver; a contractual agreement with a motivated young artisan to utilize their ingenuity to produce a professional piece of work . I don't want to make the classically unAmerican mistake of the deriding an entity of free enterprise but, Fivrr is a pyramid scheme rolled out in online form, and it's most successful contractors produce its most mediocre services . You do not become featured on fiverr for producing high-quality work for employers who can vouch your commercially safe and tested ability to perform your duties . You become successful and highly featured in the listed results for sellers by producing extremely sub par and sub intelligent, half assed, nearly automated feats of anti-imagination . Taking a piece of clipart and combining it with a font is considered logo creation . Taking a ramshackle resume and throwing it through a word processor is considered resume editing . Taking a useless copy and slapping it onto a premade template is considered resume creation . I have had several experiences with fivrr and can testify that the results' most outstanding and enduring quality has been that they are bad . Merely bad . The ""gigs"" could be performed by a Low-level computer program; and most likely are, in many cases . The focus for the sellers is on quantity, not quality, and it is very difficult to place who, if not an endless supply of dissatisfied customers, they're for. There are few people I'm sure who lack the ingenuity to use Photoshop who still desperately require and can make any use of a corporate logo generated by its most rudimentary functions . And few prospective employees entering the job market who don't understand where to find basic resume templates in word processing tools who have any success with their low-quality resume.

Customers also force you to do free revisions for completed work that they initially gave a five star review for and personal messages of praise for such a good job you do with your work.

6418,"So I see a lot of reviews about buyers being scammed, and I totally see why. Fiverr is a good idea that's been executed poorly in all aspects, and I'll tell you, it's no cake walk for a real seller either. While having to compete with the cheaper copywriters and crap that run rampant across the website, the system in place where your exposure is totally dependant on reviews, while not unusual itself, is heavily influenced by that first review. My integrity as a seller is greatly influenced by the first review I get. With that comes the seller system where we don't get to pick what we can or can't take; if they order it, it accepts, with no regard to our work load, POOR money management wherein if you complete an order early, you still have to wait for the due date to pass, PLUS two weeks to process and lost profit and it's just not worth it when you need the money NOW. There's also the matter of declination, which negatively impacts your page if you have to turn down someone, and the content timer where your maximum limit is 30 from (auto) accept or you get bad marks that pressures the sellers into rushing or becoming overloaded. Granted, there are some sleazy folks floating, but it completely washes away the chances or real work getting accomplished, and some buyers are just as cheap as the sellers.  Case in point: I have two gigs set up, one for simple pencil story board for visual context, to turn script or novel into light cartoon format; and actual comic work, drawn, inked, etc, for two difference prices and extras. A customer began hounding questions about quality and such on the story board, which I gave a guarantee to, then asked if I can add ink to it, and I ago redirect him to the other option, after he claimed it was a story board for a film project. Storyboards don't require high quality ink. He now refuses to explain what the project is for, and instead of giving character designs, he insists on cutting a pasting ideas from copywrited images rather than make his own. From an artist standpoint, it's unbearable due to the copywriter fears, and his amoral lack of creative and poor writing ability, as well as his attempts at returning to ""story board plus ink"" instead of proper comic, which is more expensive, so it have given me a harsh sense of malice for my skill having to work with someone so unprofessional as to use ""lol"" in correspondence. He eventually bought the proper gig, but it left me two weeks to complete almost 20 pages, and desperate for money and that lauded first review, I had to comply, only to find out how in creative and fishy he was, as well as it would take a month to get my money, complete or no, and what originally started at $55 became $44, then $42 some odd through PayPal, etc, whereby I am trapped between quality of work, quantity of work, price and time, to either list realistic expectation of maximum days (29) and wait that long for money I need now, and push away buyers who want it ""quick"" or list impossible odds to make ends meet and have disgruntled buyers. It is not a good system. It is not worth the heartache and stress. Sell on Etsy, sell on DeviantArt, sell anywhere but here. For here there be bull$#*!.",1,fiverr.com

6440,"I am writing this review in order to add additional info to a previous review I wrote. My first review is still extremely accurate to how my experience with this website went, but I need to add two more elements to how fiverr will screw you over.  Problem one: fiverr has no customer service. No number is provided. The only contact info is an email. On top of this the only response you will receive is automated and sketchy. I put in two separate complaints using their customer service email and received two identical responses from different customer service reps. Fiverr has gone as far as making up fake names for fake reps that send you automated email responses days after putting in requests. This leads me to conclude that there are no service reps that actually exist. If you ever have customer service problems on fiverr you will never get them resolved.  Problem two: fiverr has very sketchy terms in their customer agreement. If you attempt to retreive funds from fiverr that are stuck in your ""shopping balance"" (refer to my previous review) fiverr you can put in a dispute with pay pal or your credit card service. Fiverr will send you another automated alert from a fake rep saying that this violates your terms of agreement and to promptly retract your dispute. So fiverr has found a very crafty way of keeping disatisfied customers money with the tactic. You can choose to keep your dispute active, but know this bit of sneaky information ----> If you do retract your dispute with pay pal you can not re open it. Do not retract your dispute in fear of breaking your agreement. Your best chance of retrieving your money is by letting this dispute continue. Hopefully your money is returned because fiverr must deliver the product that you payed for in order to keep the funds.  Please refer to my previous review for further information. I am writing these reviews because I don't want other people to fall into their traps.",1,fiverr.com

It doesn't go back to you but instead goes to Fiverr.  Don't trust the 5 star reviews that you see as well as the good commentaries because in order for them to scam more people, they have to get fake people, fake high rate reviews and fake accounts to convince real people to burn their money for their own benefit.

So after the order is marked complete you can't do anything!!! I have received no material I can use and the customer service does not guide or help in anything.

6453,The customer service reps at Fiverr are simply the worst. I am specifically speaking of the women based on the female icons they are allowed to represent themselves with. They rigidly handle matters and us very little common sense if any. You have to explain the simplest of issues to them in many different ways and still they may only realize only a small part of the matter. Resulting in getting absolutely nowhere. I have been a seller on Fiverr for two years and it has not gotten any better. Well it did for a short moment and went backwards. Furthermore the more Fiverr upgrades their system the worst it is getting. My account is constantly effected by their upgrades resulting in the inability to get my clients their files that have been paid for and if a buyer cancels a sell or the sell is cancelled the buyer is penalized. I was penalized in several ways one specifically not be able to contact inquiries in my inbox because to keep a sell from being cancelled I provided a client with my email and a Dropbox link. None of this was taken into consideration as Fiverr's system was not operating properly. Fiverr never takes responsibility for any of their wrong doing or technical issues and rarely fixes the matter. I do know this is prohibited via their TOS however considering their system was functioning improperly I would have thought they would have taken it under advisement at least. So no matter what losing the sell or saving the sell I am penalized.  Fiverr is a great system for novice and professional sellers alike. You just have to weed out a lot of the matter to get to the professionals. There are many scammers who are buyers and sellers on Fiverr and you constantly have to find ways to protect your own work because Fiverr will not back you as a seller. There are those who come to Fiverr expecting to pay $5 for work that is worth hundreds and Fiverr will not back you as a seller when they buyer gets upset about it. They will tell you that you need to be better at your customer service. Ha! Isnt that ironic.,1,fiverr.com
6454,"Some of the Fiverr sellers are just scammers, they charge for some work and they don´t deliver, and after 2 or 3 weeks they just cancel with no reason. Customer service just allows you to receive the money and don´t even allow you to put a review on the sellers, they protect the sellers even though many of them are just scammers, they don´t really care about customers, they don´t solve anything for you.  5USD for some work? forget it, they just want you to get in there, and after you ask them they charge you 5 o 6 times more for the work, o even more, the 5USD is just a way to call your attention.",1,fiverr.com

Then Fiverr, instead of just returning the customer's money, adds it to a balance that can obviously only be used on Fiverr... They have no customer service phone number, so i had to send a message and wait. Two hours and forty five minutes later, they had marked my complaint ticket 'resolved' and refunded only a third of my money.....

6458,I signed up for a gig to create a responsive website. I paid over $300 dollars and am still not getting anything wanted out of it. It has been 3 months now. If you let the seller mark the order as completed and let 30 days go by you can't get your money back and the seller can basically take as long as they want and ignore all your requests. The seller reviews don't mean anything as if you wait a short period of time once the gig is marked as completed you can not rate the seller. So if you are waiting for modifications you may not be able to review seller after the final project is completed. The sellers know this. Update: the incomplete site is loaded. Hate it. Waste of money. Not once did Nextair ask me for my opinion. He just complained every time I asked for something.,1,fiverr.com

A provider named csssandra promised to deliver a single page website design in 4 days. 3 weeks later after demanding more money it is still not done. They keep arguing over what is done and some places on the page still has latin words on it and says literally ""your name here"". The customer service is terrible and refuses to refund my money. I started with one person and they were terrible and I got a refund and I was not allowed to get my money back and had to hire someone else that cost more and that is how I ended up in the circumstance I am in right now. Just an absolutely awful experience and I would not recommend them for anything, ever.",1,fiverr.com
6460,"I recently wrote a book that needed a cover and someone recommended Fiverr. I was told it was hit and miss, so I tried several designers just to see what they came up with. I figured at five bucks a pop it was worth a shot. They were all pretty terrible. It was worth a try, but I had just about decided to spend more money and use 99 Designs when I got the last cover I had requested. It was perfect and I was elated to save the $299 that 99 Designs would have cost! Then the nightmare began. Because I did love it, I purchased extra services - then the designer went MIA. After two weeks of frustration (during which I missed a deadline), I contacted customer service and at the same time sent the e-cover (which was complete) to a different designer to covert into a full print cover (he did and it was usable). Well, apparently since I purchased extra services from the original designer, my ""completed"" order (with the ebook) was no longer considered complete and according to customer service, I didn't own rights to the design, but if I hadn't ordered the extra services, I would have! Go figure. So not only was I now out $60 for the extras I purchased from the original designer plus the extra fee I paid the new guy to convert something apparently I don't own, but I was now also out over two weeks of time, energy, frustration and lost the design I wanted. (not to mention another $25 fishing for ideas).  As of this writing I have not received a penny back from Fiverr although they acknowledge the designer did not follow through and I'm supposed to get ""something"" back at some point. Although their customer service team is responsive their hands are tied. There is absolutely NO protection for their customers, and NO communication of several ""glitches"" in their system that can negatively impact you. I was not even able to leave a negative review for the designer since you are only able to leave reviews once the order is complete (Wondered where all those five star reviews come from? That is why!) My advice is that if you are just fishing for ideas and have no timelines or deadlines, for five bucks--go for it. But if you need services for something that actually matters, stay FAR FAR FAR away. Fork up the cash and use a professional service from the beginning, it will actually save you both time and money in the long run.",1,fiverr.com

The client made an error and duplicated the gig request. I completed the gig within hours. 13 emails went back and forth between the client and myself and the client was happy with the results. Two days later, Fiverr sends and email and reports me as late. I contacted Fiverr, showed them the email trail and screenshots. They understood it was a duplicate order Fiverr response: so sad. Dont worry its showing only for late for 60 days?? I said what? I was not late! I provided the service. They said nothing can be done.  They are stuck and inflexible. The service is good if you have no issues. Otherwise, be prepared for uncaring and poor service.

This guy dragged his feet and suddenly he couldn't design anything. It went past the deadline and I gave him an extension because he needed more time and he will get penalized if the order is not marked as complete. BIG MISTAKE. He is gone with the money and I have no design. Lost time and money. There was a big customer on my side that I lost because I couldn't present my goods. Never give extensions when the gig is not completed on time. Fiverr's response is to talk to the designer.

6463,"I had many friends recommend Fiverr so I checked it out. Looked like fun! Choosing a graphic designer to do a 5""x7"" double sided postcard for me was exciting. I chose a guy who I felt had all the fun and creative graphic postcards and got started on my first $5 purchase. The first communications were so weak and confusing that I was getting scared. I wanted to cancel right then and there. What happened is that I sent in the requirements with my photos and threw in some notes and all I got back was ""helo. hi"" There was no response to anything in my first email and it felt weird. The first draft was a post card design that I could have done myself on vista print. All my specifications were ignored. So, I marked up the postcard with notes, sent it back, and sent an email that I was disappointed that this did not look like any of his gigs posted. I gave specific examples of the postcards that I liked. His response was a sad emoticon. I got the second draft and only some changes were done and those changes were again the same simple plain stuff as the first and not very noticeable. I could have done those changes myself. I sent a message to the seller and told him that I was really unsatisfied and to keep the $5. I gave him a horrible review.  Now, as I am writing this, I have received 8 well written and clear emails from him (more are coming as I just wrote that last sentence). He's said that he was shocked and upset that this was not to my satisfaction. What could he do to fix it. Now that the bad review went through for him, he is begging for me to remove it because it's lowering his rating and he can't accept other posted jobs and will fix anything that I need. I would like to add that the email response is so much quicker now. The prior two answers he gave me took 24hrs each time. I came across this site because I was so mad and frustrated about what I got and googled complaints. I realize now that I should have been more savvy on what I was purchasing and who I was purchasing it from.",1,fiverr.com

6478,"This is another bogus site offering freelance services.  1. Most of the ""sellers"" are rogues - poor to no services will be delivered 2. They will submit to you for review that order is completed even when they had just started work 3. When order is submitted for review, it is so that Fiverr's system kicks in to automatically mark the order as completed after 3 days. You will not receive any notification in the email. 4. Once the system marks the order as completed, money is released to the seller 14 days after. You can only cancel order out of mutual consent with the seller. 5. When you query Fiverr for such a bogus process, customer support is quick to pull up terms of service that you will probably be seeing for the first time and telling you that orders are only refunded back into your ""shopping balance"". But this BS and bogus if you fall for it. They have no right to hold on to your funds as it violates the credit card industry guidelines for merchants or with PayPal. 6 Fight for your refunds, they will try to buy time. They will put restrictions on your accounts saying that opening a dispute with PayPal or your Credit Card company is a violation of their bogus ""terms of service"" They will urge you to close those disputes for the matter to be resolved, if you fall for it, you lose your right to fight for a refund through those channels as for example in PayPal, closed disputes cannot be reopened or escalated to PayPal Claims. My advice, just stay away. It is rather unfortunate because I would imagine that there are some genuine sellers with honest intentions to deliver good service but really they are like the remnants. My advice to such is to leave these fraudsters and go to platforms such as Upworks. My advice to Fiverr, you may have been scamming some but you cannot scam all. I am coming for your head.

I cancelled that order and returned to someone who I purchased a gig off of a year ago which cost me 4 times as much. Then even though I had $10 in credit on my account, your site pulled the full amount out of my PayPal.

I agreed to provide him the extra time and the due date came and went again without any product being given. When I contact him this morning, I get a .png file instead of the different versions that the gig promises and no source files. To make it worse, the image doesn't fit on the size page that I informed him multiple times that I was looking for. So bottom line is that I was scammed out of my $40 plus your commission.

6501,I earned several hundred dollars on fiver with 100% positive reviews from my customers. Fiverr refused to release any of my earnings saying they did not believe my identity. They had my Paypal account info and when I asked how else I prove who I am they suspended my account and kept my money. This is a felony in the US. Fiverr needs to be brought down.

6502,"I really did, but my very first experience was a bust and now I'm worried about their service. I went on Fiverr looking for someone to help me with my landing page. At first I was very optimistic and elated by the prices and values. I even started thinking about sourcing all my work there.  The first few people I messaged took a day or so to message me back, and with a deadline I needed help fast. I then created a request and a person responded saying they would create my page for only $5 bucks. I thought, ""wow this is great"" without realizing very few people will do quality work for that amount of money. This guy promised me a nice squeeze page in less than 24 hours, and after giving him my WordPress info and waiting almost 2 days, I can tell you the site looks nothing like what I asked for. It doesn't even look like a sales page so much as a bunch of mumbo jumbo put together. Granted, he tried, and he gave me some useful images but it's no where near what I requested. Part of me feels I should have known better than trying to trust a $5 service, but the other part feels these people should be able to create what they offer. So, I paid this guy for his time and asked him to exit my WordPress account. Two days wasted but a good lesson learned.  Since then I have tried to take up other services but now I'm not as open to it. I realize there are some really good artists and designers on there simply trying to make a buck, but for every one good seller there's a few shady ones that may waste your time.  My tip to you is that you have standards while performing your search, and try to avoid paying until a sample of your requested work is completed. Furthermore, if you need word content on your site, or have a lot of info to explain, try to find someone very fluent in English or you will have issues. Last, someone may advertise $5 bucks but most services cost more than that. $5 is for most to simply look at your work, and depending on your work load your fee can go up substantially, so in some cases you may be better off looking for someone reputable.  I feel my time has been wasted but hopefully I'll find what I'm looking for.",1,fiverr.com

6518,"I am an ex-Fiverr freelancer, and I say ex- for a few very good reasons, from all perspectives - freelancers selling gigs, customers buying those gigs, and the company itself. Let me enumerate why I left Fiverr. 1. Actual freelance work is generally hard to get in the first place if you're just starting out, unless you are willing to ""SELL! SELL! SELL!"" your product or service at a rock bottom price. In other words, about $1 USD/hr. The only way around this is to induce your ""upsell"", or else farm out your work to even lower paying workforces. Note that there is also a good chance that your ""client"" is in fact just another Fiverr worker, looking to act as a broker, and scouting out new talent. This is what happened to me. They were simply taking my work, making a few tweaks, and upselling to another client at a higher hourly rate. Also, know up front that Fiverr will take a dollar out of every five dollars (not gigs, actual amount paid - $5 gig you get $4, custom order $500 gig, they get $100 etc.) so that's 20% of your earnings gone right there. Not only that, they will charge you additional money to transfer your money out of your Fiverr account to Paypal (who also might charge you, depending on how you've set your account up.) Fiverr will happily retain your earnings for a full 2 weeks (10 business days) before you are paid for your work. Excellent business practice, guys - nice way to scam your workforce! 2) I've never been an actual buyer on Fiverr, but pretty much all the issues that everyone else has brought up is right on the nose. Low cost equals low quality, in general. Not to mention copyright issues, communication issues, payment issues, and the overarching ethics of doing business this way. The sweetest part about this? They also have a (imho) fishy payout schemes like Payza and Payoneer which issue you a debit card, on which there's also a fee. As you can probably tell, I'm not happy with this business in the least.",1,fiverr.com

It is a cheap gigs platform where all incompetent scammers have an opportunity to prey on people looking for cost effective work to be performed.

He handed me back a ""logo"" that was literally just text in a font that you can grab off the internet for free with a crappy three second shape design next to it (it wasn't even a font good for logos). I know this because I HAD THE SAME EXACT FONT ALREADY INSTALLED ON MY COMPUTER. I literally could have created the same logo in less a minute. The only reason I didn't create the logo myself was because I wasn't familiar with vector programs. Even so, I know how to use the damn text tool.

6532,"UPDATE: After my first attempt at a getting a book cover done ended in disaster and missing a distribution deadline due to the Fiverr Seller's inability to understand simple English instructions, I got a refund for the full amount. But that terrible experience costs sales for a book we were doing for Christmas distribution. After a 24 hour delivery was promised it took 10 days to end up with very poor quality work that was rejected and I got the refund. That's not what I wanted. 2nd Attempt with Fiverr. After a rocky start, the 2nd Fiverr Seller was much better but I have to wonder why people who seem to have no basic design sense are graphic designers. Simple things need to be spelled out in the extreme. Things like u don't need a huge publisher's logo in the bottom back cover corner. You shouldn't put the author's name right on the very edge of the cover. After several revisions the 2nd attempt did end up working out. However, it was December 28 by then and many lost Christmas sales. I was so amazed and grateful the 2nd Fiverr Seller managed to complete the job, I actually gave them a bit more money. But it's not the money that's the issue. It's the lack of quality control. Anybody with a computer can join Seller and claim to have a skill. WARNING: Fiverr does not pre-check work of the Sellers. They rely solely on customer reviews so if you can get on a few different machines and get some friends to give you 5 Star reviews, you look like an expert. It's fraudulent and irresponsible behavior on Fiverr's part but all they are interested in is their 5%. Their policies are entirely about them, not the customer. So I would say try it if you must but don't spend much and don't expect much. In fact, if it's a design project, may as well get Adobe InDesign and learn to use it yourself. It's what I plan to do. Overall Fiverr is about making money for Fiverr and has no interest in the quality of work done by its Sellers. With Fiverr you are totally on your own.

6556,"There are a number of reasons to avoid this website. For starters, if you try to get a sample of what an artist can produce at a bargain, you'll get little more than someone finding clip art or copyrighted works, and trying to sell them to you with their watermark attached. If you try to get advertising, you'll either get: a) someone posted your add to a site nobody ever heard of, or b) someone will promise ""likes,"" downloads, etc., and then their account will disable after you paid through Fiverr. Also, Fiverr will not refund anything. They'll claim that they can't refund after an order is ""complete."" Their definition of ""complete"" must be a little flexible... There are numerous similar stories all over the Internet regarding how people get their money taken. But, it's not just customers looking for a good deal, it's also sellers. They get lots of money in their accounts and then Fiverr deletes their accounts, claiming they violated the sites terms. In addition, their site is not very well designed at all and the few services they offer are not very useful at all. I mean, who really needs someone to ""... sing Happy Birthday as jungle boy in the River?""",1,fiverr.com
6557,This site is a r ip out. There is no customers service. Afer they get you money they act as if they have no accountability to the customers at all. They wont email you back or call you back. They just don't care after they have your money.,1,fiverr.com
6558,"During my 9 months on Fiverr, as a seller, I have been bullied, offended and humiliated by some buyers whose main pupose was to take advantage of how the site allows them to obtain free work. It is quite common for a buyer to manipulate any sale by threatening to leave negative feedback. Without any warning or a courtesy email, Fiverr decided to recently restrict my account which, following my enquiries to their cutomer desk, they allege that, and I quote, ""we've received several complaints from your previous buyers regarding the performance of your services on Fiverr. After further review of your previous order and account history, your account has been disabled. Fiverr condemns bullying, harassment, and hate speech towards others. Taking in to consideration multiple factors, we can not allow sellers on our marketplace who offer poor experiences for buyers. Please contact us again after a safety period of 45 days to learn how to withdraw any available revenue from this account."" To clarify, I had a 100% score from 59 five-star reviews and repeat business from multiple buyers, which it is not a reflection of poor performance. I have been a exemplary seller and I am too against bullying, harrassment and hate speech towards anyone, especially behind a computer screen. If Fiverr believes that getting sellers to be manipulated by the actions of some of their buyers will help the site, perhaps time will show them differently. I would also like their services to provide me with the details of the complaints they mentioned (which I have asked them already and have not been provided with as yet) so that I can take the matter further and defend mysef and my good name in the appropriate setting. I dispute all of the allegations made by Fiverr, especially but not exclusively those of providing a poor experience to buyers and would like to have this matter assessed by their legal team prior to taking it to a law court. As it appears account restrictions on their site are directy and indirectly connected to breach of their terms of service (which are not substantiated by the communications with the buyers that potentially made these alleged complaints). It is astonishing to see this account disabled. The ""previous order"" that Fiverr mentions in their response to me was of a buyer that had his sale review REMOVED 3 TIMES for breaching Fiverr's terms of service. I will omit this buyer's ID for legal reasons. I would like to clarify that a mesage was sent to this buyer stating: ""As per this gig description, I only provide a PDF file... Please specify the changes you need to make to the original document and I will amend it accordingly. Regards.."". The buyer never requested any changes and started making big assertions to the effect that, and I quote, "" The format sent by seller is not editable and thus is useless."" in a attempt to cancel the order mutually and despite knowing, from the gig description, that the final gig was only to be delivered in pdf. I responded by stating that, and I quote, ""the terms and conditions of sale are clearly described. You are attempting to obtain something that you're not entitled to and, therefore, I am not accepting the cancellation of this order. If you need to amend/edit the document in the future you'll need to do it through me. I have delivered the an employee handbook to you, in pdf format, as specified for this gig for which I charged you $15"". It seems that Fiverr believes this is providing a poor experience but is it? and to whom? The ""several complaints"" that Fiverr mentions in their response to me are, most likely, and in my opinion, coming from the same buyer. Strangely enough, after a few months of not hearing from a previous buyer that purchased the same gig as the person specified above, this buyer asked me, in similarity to the above, whether I could provide them with a 'word file', despite them knowing that my gig description states that such service is not available. Coincidentally, These two buyers are located in the same country too. I would like to point out that Fiverr is based in Israel. As I am a lawyer myself, I will urge all of the unhappy former Fiverr members, that have legitimately been treated unfairly, to team up with me in a class action against Fiverr.",1,fiverr.com

6566,"Our company needed a map illustration/perspective drawing done and decided to try out one of the illustrators from Fiverr. The person we placed the order with had really good reviews and his portfolio seemed pretty good and he was confident that he would be able to deliver what we needed based on the examples I provided him. I was very specific in the style and detail of drawing that I wanted and also sent him examples. This was a custom order and turned out to be more costly than I expected, but I still went with him trusting that he would deliver. When I received the first draft, it was nothing like the quality and standards that I expected. I was so shocked and disappointed. The style of drawing looked nothing like the examples I showed him, the perspective was off, colors were all wrong, and just the level of attention to detail wasn't there. I attempted to provide very clear instructions on the revisions that I wanted to see changed on the illustration, but the results kept getting worse and worse. I also felt like he didn't put much effort into making the changes and just the quality of work was horrible. I felt like this illustrator should not have agreed to take on this project if he wasn't comfortable doing these types of drawings. This was my first time using Fiverr and overall, I'm extremely disappointed and frustrated and I don't think I will trust using Fiverr again.  After filing a complaint and disputing this case, the Fiverr customer support team was completely useless.

They immediately filed a mutual agreement to refund my money which initially I thought was pretty straight up until i realized the money goes into your fiverr account for more jobs. I did write a ticket to the head of the support and he actually did refund it back to paypal .....but as soon as the seller sent the mutual cancellation and i accepted it (with no knowledge of what ill explain later anywhere in site), that erased the possibility of me leaving a review of this fraudulent seller (he had something like 22k reviews 5 star) so basically the fraudulent seller have a shield and a way to hide on the site provided by fiverr themselves. I have to wonder if fiverr is in cahoots with fraudulent sellers because of the high 5 star rating for an obvious fraud and for the ways they provide them to keep this hidden and does not give an accurate review system which is so important. it all only makes sense if this whole thing is geared to screw you from your money which is what i think is happening here. based on the many other reviews I've read across the internet i think i got extremely lucky getting my money back to paypal. Even so I can tell this site is still active in fraudulent activity.So be warned. I should also mention no job i ever bought amounted to any sale or anything beneficial.

My orders were cancelled left and right with no explanation. I confronted the sellers about it, saying it was false advertising/extortion, and I contacted Fiverr's customer service for assistance. The very next day, Fiverr knocked me off of the to levels I worked two years to achieve. When I confronted Fiverr about removing my two levels, they advised me that the process is ""automated"" and that I no longer met the requirements for a level 2 status. Really? With 100% positive feedback I no longer met the requirements?

Buyers Side: Most work provided there is crap, these so called writers use word spinners, 99,5% designers use clipart for logos of templates for other stuff (business cards, flyers etc), lots of copyright infringement, most work in their gallery examples is fake. a saxophone player guy that I ordered from actually used a virtual instrument instead of an actual saxophone to record the solo. the list goes on..  long story short, the site is just overall crap, they advertise themselves as a place for professionals, but the majority of the people there don't even speak english nor have the base knowledge of the thing they advertise they can do. oh and something interesting, even if you get a refund from a seller, your money stays there as a ""Fiverr Credit"" which means you can't get it back on your card / paypal.",1,fiverr.com

Well Fiverr you need to do better, maybe for your fans on the Eastern World, Tel Aviv and your surrounding neighbors, that would be acceptable.. i don't think i would communicate with this customer service even if you paid me to. Here is my response to customer service this morning: I'm very very very displeased with your customer service. I don't think I'm interested in using the service of the website for fear of delay and inconvenience that I might have to wait days before I can get someone from customer service get back to me, and freelancer refuses to start working based on the fact I can't make or process payment. I've dealt with many many tech companies, large and small and I should say this one is the only in a long long time, perhaps in years that let me feel so dissatisfied with the service, I almost felt angry as I ended getting no work done and missing schedule as a lack of time customer service, come on guys, we are living in 2015 here.

6632,"My review is based on one experience but it was enough for me to see how they work. I choose a seller with almost 7,000 5-star reviews for a 300-word blog article. His profile described how passionate he was about writing and providing interesting content.""with so many great online reviews, how bad can he be?"" I provided a clear outline of what should be covered in the article and several websites where they could research the topic and find all the info they needed. Even though the seller had such great reviews, I still didn't have high expectations - I just needed a decent write up. The article I received was such low quality, though. Poor grammar, lots of repetition, no mention of the key requirements in my outline - high-school level writing - and that is giving it too much credit. When I complained to the writer, he said it was written by one of his newer writers and he has so many writers he can't look at them all. (What about his profile that implied he writes all the articles and was passionate, etc etc.?) He also said, ""I try to only hire American English speaking writers, but since I only correspond with them through email, it is hard to say sometimes."" I realize now that he is farming out the work to people anywhere in the world, he has no quality control. I don't know how he has managed to get so many good reviews, but I do know that it was impossible for me to leave a bad review. AND - this guy was probably one of the good ones, because at least he responded to my criticism and offered me a refund (it's not really a refund, it's a credit since I don't get the money back.)  So, who wins in this situation? Fiverr does - they get to keep my transaction fee and they will get the $5 I was ""refunded"" because I will never use that credit.  I understand their business model now: Fiverr doesn't care about quality. At all. They make money on every job, no matter what happens. The vendor profiles are complete lies - they make it sound like they are doing the work but they are just farming it out to whomever, with no quality control.

They charge buyers a 5-10% ""processing"" fee that many sellers are not even aware of. The other problem is that seller reviews are a fraud. Sellers can avoid negative feedback by simply canceling the job. The only way you can leave negative feedback for a seller is if you pay full price for incomplete or unsatisfactory work. Otherwise you have to agree to a cancellation to get your money back and you loose the right to rate them. Also, sellers can cancel unilaterally even if you don't agree.

If l wanted adsense ads on the site l would have to leave a positive review for the seller first or pay another $20.  As for the traffic to your website, FORGET IT, rubbish bot traffic which will show as clicks, but you will never get a sale from it.  Make money gigs forget also. Question, if they were earning the amounts off money they talk about in the gig would they really be selling the info for $5? earn $500 a day, $30,000 a month, etc. Many off these sellers also offer free gigs for leaving them positive feedback, this should not be allowed. A buyer should be allowed to leave an honest and constructive review off the gig, good or bad. Abusive feedback to the seller should not be allowed.  Feedback on the traffic gigs should again be better from the buyers. Results is what counts from traffic not clicks. As l stated earlier l have never found an honest gig on traffic on fiverr. The clicks show on the link they send you but not on my trackers. Real Scam traffic gigs.

Hello Support Team, THIS IS AN URGENT MATTER AND I WANT YOUR ATTENTION TO OUR PROBLEM THAT WE ARE FACING DUE TO YOUR UNPROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOUR.I have submitted tickets for numerous time and that too for the same reason.WE ARE HERE FACING A SERIOUS & MAJOR ISSUE OF GIGS DEACTIVATION and WE NEED YOUR RESPONSE ASAP.i am astonished that your team is not helping out and had left us hanging in between by not responding to our tickets.IS THIS THE PROFESSIONAL WAY TO TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS? If you arent aware of the reason then Let me again summarise it for you.I have been told that we are operating mass accounts from the same IP and thats why the gigs have been deactivated.COME ON!! ARE YOU SERIOUS?? Since 8 months,We are working as a freelancer on your portal from India,giving our 100% to become a Top Rated seller from level 1 and What you are doing now is FLUSHING THE WATER ON OUR HARD EARNED EFFORTS.If you dont know then We are using shared internet connection in our commercial complex where our office is based and Looking at your portals popularity,There must be various Fiverr accounts that are operated by different freelancers from our complex.We cannot check with each and every person working in our complex whether they are having Fiverr accounts or not. So do you think that it is the right way to check the authenticity of a person just from the IP address?? If your answer is YES then I highly recommend you to use some authentic procedure like requesting legal document(Driving license, voting card,etc) while opening any account and i am sure it will save you from blame of deactivating accounts just on the basis of IP address.Even you can use verification by video calling in the same manner like other portals are doing.I can show you legal documents for our account verification or you can video call me on Skype and confirm my identity. By the way,Do you have any standard policies regarding the verification of person that is operating any particular account?? because i havent came across with any of such notification from your side at the time of opening my account and if it is not like that then i will make sure that you face a legal action from authorized entities to protect my customer rights. You does not follow standard procedure for verification and YOU TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS IN A UNPROFESSIONAL MANNER and that disappoints to me a huge extent and even WHAT I CANNOT DIGEST IS YOUR AUDACITY TO DEACTIVATE MY GIGS WITHOUT NOTIFYING ME, after all its my Fiverr profile.right? Dont i have the right to be notified prior to deactivation of my gigs? But one thing is certain that You have done serious damage to my business and i cannot allow that.Though you not notified to me but i am notifying you that if i am not getting response from you guys within 48 hours and then i will have to take this matter into court.And I assure you that you will land yourself in a huge mess if my gigs are not activated within 24 hours. I am also planning to switch my business to some other portal where customer is well served,NOTIFIED PRIORLY,having FINE SENSE OF VERIFYING CUSTOMERS.Also,i will not recommend your portal to any of my friends.I dont want to ruin my reputation among my friends by recommending portal who doesnt even care to respond to client's query.

First, I think it terrible that someone is forced to even think about making a product for the cost of latte in NY. Seller should open communication with buyers so that they can sell up. I gave very specific requests, neither of the 2 designers made the marks. Instead, they returned something they probably already had on-hand with the addition of a few revisions.  My sellers had great sense for the beginning of ""customer service"". One had fantastic counter-manner, however,  Seller #1:  gave me a logo that ""would be perfect for Affliction"" (a feedback from a friend).  He insisted that all logos would be done based only on his style. The sample logos were a lot more elegant; mine looked like a logo for a B-rated version of the Hunger Game.  Seller #2: I wanted a seal from this seller and had created the whole seal so that this seller didnt have to ""think"" too hard.   He was easy-going, really courteous, but the seal came back nothing like I sent him. Our motto was incorrectly quoted, contained grammar errors, and our logo (within the seal he created) was replaced with something that looks like ""double happiness"".",1,fiverr.com

6674,"I reviewed lots of portfolios and settled on one where every logo looked really sharp and unique. I paid for just the $5 logo thinking if I was happy I would use this designer again.  Well, I was given a 10 day wait and the order went 11 days. On the 12th day I got the logo along with an additional HD file for having to wait the extra day but it was useless. My site is about budget family travel. I gave a very detailed explanation of what I needed and my site url for reference. I assumed the designer would visit the site and get a feel for what it needed.  Instead, I got a logo in a very patriotic color scheme that looked very much like it was supposed to resemble a mother giving birth. Basically a large ""C"" shape, open side down, with a circle on top (moms head). Then another of the same shape, only smaller, flipped around and placed inside the ""arms"" of the mom. Everyone I asked to look at it said it made them think of a woman giving birth to a baby head first.  My tag line also includes the letter ""g"" in it but the bottom of the G was cut off. So it looked like a really glaring mistake, or a rush job.  Supposedly, I get a revision so I wrote back and explained why I can't use this logo. That was three days ago and I've yet to get a reply.

Rather than being directed to PP and having to login to confirm the payment and source of funds, the Fiverr page told me that the funds were successfully transferred. That was the first time a PP payment went through without me logging in and confirming and I didn't even know that was possible. The Fiverr page didn't say anything about it upfront. The problem is that the PP funds were taken from a bank account that had less than the payment amount so the bank charged me a $35 NSF fee. I brought this to the attention of both Fiverr and PP and it took a few emails and finally PP paid me $25.

Fiverr have perhaps 3-4 staff working on support (and this is for a site that supposedly has hundreds of thousands of transactions every day). As a level 2 (which you attain after completing 50 orders) you are meant to get Priority Support. You don't. This is an outright lie. You get the same support as when you first start on the site - That is, you're lucky to get a response within 4-5 days. When they do respond, it's often canned answers. They refund buyers without consulting with the seller or even reviewing the cases properly thus offering ZERO protection for freelancers on the site. So all that hard work you do and then get paid for? A few days, week, month or even 6 months later...The payment you received can be returned to the buyer no questions asked leaving you out of pocket. When making modifications to your gigs - I added a header graphic to one of my gigs (they keep telling you do to it as they claim it improves conversions). It took TEN DAYS for them to approve the graphic! TEN DAYS. Moral of the story is this - You get peanuts for the work you do and even those peanuts can be taken from you without question.

You get a red warning for writing it. * Vacation time for your account only for 28 days per year (Yes!

They basically work the system, string you along to let you think your job is being done, then ask for a few days grace and hide behind the cancellation policy.  Right now getting customer service via their website is near impossible, they police their facebook (but complaints on there do seem to get their attention), their sellers are protected by the cancellation policy and that leaves us buyers where exactly? I'm reporting my experience to the Better Business, Bureau and suggest that everyone else - buyer or seller do the same. After having this issue and searching the web for help I realized the site is known for near non existent customer support and has even had magazine articles written up about how bad the customer help features are.",1,fiverr.com

They say, you can withdrawl your money after 40-60 day. But, after 60 day, i contact them again to withdrawn my money, the response was nothing. Surely, they took all of your money after your effort and hard job. beware of this site. The costumer service and security system soo poor.",1,fiverr.com

Unlike most companies that have in-house illustrators this one tricks artists into doing work for free. I was soon contacted by another ""client"" with another job.

I paid $45 for a $5 gig, and never received it. They say you won't be charged until you get your order but that's a huge lie. Once your money is tied up with these scammers, you will never see it again. They do not refund money or honor their guarantees. The seller I dealt with simply stole my money and never delivered the product. Then Fiverr told me they do not give money back, but only refund ""fiverr crrdits"" in case you want to order anything else you will never receive. They are truly crooks. 	I paid with paypal and opened a dispute with them since Fiverr has the worst customer support in the whole world. After countless emails from Fiverr trying to bully me and harass me out of the paypal dispute I was pissed. They try to avoid the fact that they will not give your money back, but rather refund you is $#*!ty useless Fiverr credits. SO they just stole my money and lied.  	If you leave bad reviews on sellers, they simply delete them to make themselves look good. They pay people to write good reviews and get rid of bad ones online as well. SCAM!

Fiverr.com is run by several teenagers who thinks it's fun to block certain features on your account. For insusnce, blocking your emailing from being able to respond to potential buyers. Why? BECAUSE they're kids! They think it's funny. Two of there teenage employees are Iris and Oris, both unprofessional as well as ignorant. They will not respond to your concerns and just for fun, pay attention folks because if you're a seller this will hurt you.... They'll close down your account even if you have money from gigs due to you and simply keep your money? Personally I've been emailing them about my account for days and not a single response to that particular problem. If they don't respond to me by tomorrow I'm going to contact the BBB, and if they jerked you around too... Do the same!!! If you don't get your money back, contact local authority to where THEY are.

6740,"I contacted a seller on fiverr and asked them if they could do the job they advertised. They said yes so I paid them. They then did not do the work but said the job was done. I contacted fiverr but their feedback page is broken. I left negative feedback for the seller but that's all I could do.  I've been using fiverr for a long time and have found some major problems with them. For example a seller can completely ignore a payment and the buyer can't leave negative feedback for that. Or the seller can accept the job, sit on it for weeks and then give it back to the buyer and again they can't leave feedback. What? Yes, you heard me: sellers can ignore you for weeks and you can't complain. Even if the seller does accept the job there is no way to encourage them to actually do the work and no way to dispute it. After a seller says a job is done the buyer is given a box to click positive or negative feedback. Where's the dispute button? Your money is gone whether you're satisfied or not. ""But this seller has 99% feedback, must be good, right?"" Wrong: sellers create a fake buyer account and buy from themselves and leave positive feedback. Unlike eBay who check personal information and ban people using the same address or credit card, fiverr only requires an email to buy or sell so it only takes a second to create a fake account. Since the feedback is just a percentage you can't see who gave positive feedback for what, so a seller only needs to create one account and buy a few times from themselves to give themselves a stellar feedback score.  There's no way to avoid this, fiverr sucks",1,fiverr.com

And what you get is rushed, poor, low-quailty work. It's all disposable work and nothing unique or special to your business or brand. Buying any sot of logo or design work for under a certain price is just outright ridiculous. No one is going to make a logo for even $50. A good design takes time, effort, research and building blocks to access what you need as a client. Also, plagiarism is ramped. So if you want to pay $5 for something, it's always up to you. However, I will avoid this website. I gave it three stars because it does help true freelancers gain a bit if income, but I believe $5 is just too good to be true. With the fees, you won't make much as a seller either. I work as a creative in the design field, so let me tell you: you will see a difference between something $5-100 and something $500. True freelancers: don't let this be tha platform for you to make money, you're getting ripped off. For buyers, be careful of what you buy. Many ""designers"" here fake their work, steal work, or misrepresent stock designs as their own or original. I went to one of Fiverr's city events just to eat, drink and collect their goodie bag.

I can't do that and it shows me a designer with #1 rating just because she/he got two jobs and got highest feedback probably were her/his friends. If I am willing to pay for quality and say I place a budget of $400 for a design I want to keep all the fake, junk and scammers away and not waste my time. Beware of Arbitrage: arbitrage are people that have a luxury level portfolio and they look authentic designers but at the end they are subcontracting other designers and getting a margin. Yes they are making money without doing anything ... fiverr can detect this easily by automatically analyzing the reviews tree because the arbitrage folks give reviews to the real providers too.

Be careful of the email promotions they try to suck your money out and don't live up to their agreement. With the new changes, when you review your orders (I order covers) they put the water mark over it and I can barely see the cover well which is extremely important to my business. Also when you order two gigs I have to close out the gig in order to get my cover which closes the entire order!!!! I paid for two gigs and they close out everything if I agree to download my first order!! Terrible! Terrible changes to this site! Beware!",2,fiverr.com
6758,"I entered fiver looking for some graphic designers with the skills to create original graphics based on our ideas. Despite the detailed explanations, the delivered work was based on stock photos, standard letters and banners that can be found even in MS Office PowerPoint. Zero creativity. A large number of the people announcing there seem to be non English speaking people therefore explanations area wasted. They reimbursed my money but made me waste time. Complain about being paid too little for the work but they are the ones that fix the price. I even sent the material in advance to the order to have them ( the creative designers) quote but they answered: order first. Quite frankly, not a good place to find good people. The worst part: we pay our creative people very well, even commissions over every item sold. This people announcing in fiverr didn't even asked or quoted. It is so weird. Not recommended.",2,fiverr.com

6760,"I know people who have had really great experiences on Fiverr but mine was mediocre at best. I will not name the Fiverr I worked with as this person truly wanted to get better BUT some of the tactics used were less than professional. Here are some tips to watch out for... - Make sure you know exactly what you need AND the technical language to get what you need. Most gigs will have extra cost add-ons but are vague in what they entail. - The videos posted on a Fiverr gig sites as examples of their work are not necessarily done by that person. Make sure you ask if the sample video is theirs. - The star rating system can be flawed. My Fiverr asked that I rate them before the project was done... they did this by closing out the project and starting a new one when I asked for fixes. This was very unprofessional and I refused to rate them until I had the finished project in hand. I think it's a way to get around the company restrictions and to get more ratings since you'll be asked again on the second project once it's finished. - I was also pressured to give 5 stars. Once I rated (at 3 stars) I was emailed multiple times to ""please change my rating"". This is understandable since a bad rating can really hurt their chances of landing a gig... but I'm making you aware that it can happen. - I was not satisfied with the end product and decided not to use it. You can get a refund if you are not satisfied but because our working relationship was positive I did not want to do this and chalked it up to the price of doing business... tax write off. - Prices can change once you agree to your gig. I work in the same industry that I was asking the Fiverr to do work for. My instructions were clear and specific. When questions were asked if they could create an asset that was most important to my project, the Fiverr confirmed that they could do it. Two days into the project, I was told they couldn't do what I had asked for unless I paid over $100 extra... which I now know couldn't be achieved even if I'd paid... which I didn't. What I did do was downsize my request and ask for less than what I thought I had originally paid for. - On a positive note - The Fiverr I worked with was probably green. They communicated with me extremely well and wanted to make sure I was happy. I provided most of the assets they needed so it was an easier gig than most I would think. I was very easy going with them the entire gig letting them take as much time as needed. They claimed they worked through the night and that they bought new equipment for what I was asking for. I don't know if either of these statements were true but I'll lean towards the positive.",2,fiverr.com

6762,Given that my seller's offer says $5.00 to do an SEO and then quotes way over that amount isn't that false and misleading information and if so shouldn't Fiverr be partially responsible for this kind of false advertising.

And even more concerning, there is no real Help or customer service in Fiberr, cannot find it in all their site, so the question becomes: What will happen when there is a problem with a vendor, who is there to help out? Site looks great, but inspires now distrust in me when the most simple task, joining in as a customer, does not work and there is no one around to help out. I am resourcing to search the web in order to find help, outside of their site. Not really good. Specially when by doing this, I am finding all kinds of bad reviews about Fiberr. Sure way to lose clients by not providing any support.

But seriously, if you want a decent logo or graphic design, pay a local person to do it, pay someone with some understanding of marketing and communication.  My biggest irk with Fiverr, is the sellers badging me for a good review when their products have been s**t. I've been generous with some of my reviews and yet I still get emails asking for 5 stars.

6769,"ok i really think most people who come to fiverr are looking for people who do web designer type of things. they have way more services than that. most of the gig on fiver are actually NOT 5 dollars. most of the ""gigs"" on here are 35 and up the people who sell their services are usually way to cocky arrogant and most of all scammers. now everyone on here is not a scam but i would say less than half of my experiences have been unpleasant cancellation or a scam. I have had positive experiences from some people but they do not out way the negitive. fiverr doesnt do enough to help the people who they are taking their money from. here is one example. you can not change your rating from a seller after five days. so that means once you find out you were scammed its too late. my advice is to not rate. here is why people rate though fiver SAYS you are not obligated to rate but every time you log in there is a light at the top of your screen saying ""oops looks like you for got to rate your experience lets do this now"" what ever they are a rip off but their are a couple of people on there who are just trying to work for extra cash.",2,fiverr.com
6770,"I'm not complaining about Fiverr as a customer because I've found some fantastic freelancers over there who have done some beautiful work - quickly and for far less than what they're worth. I've even tipped because I'd felt they undercharged for what they've provided. However, as a freelancer myself, I wouldn't waste my time now that I've worked with this company for a little while. They take a minimum of $1 out for each gig, including extras, tips - you name it. Someone ordered a $20 gig from me and they still took $4, even though it was one gig sum, not 4. In addition, you'll wait several weeks until funds clear and they'll charge you to release them. For one $5 gig, you'll end up with $3 before it's all said and done and you won't get paid for weeks. I just wanted to put this out there. I thought it would be a good way to earn a few bucks, but for the work you do and what you get paid (after fees), I would encourage you to not underestimate your worth. Don't settle for this place.  Companies should make money to hook you up with clients - but there's a difference between profit and greed. Fiverr, in my opinion (as a freelancer) practices the latter.",2,fiverr.com

6772,"I have been both a buyer and a seller on Fiver and I've been disappointed both directions. As a buyer I've had sellers who delivered just horrible quality then got mad when asked to make it right. One even filed a complaint against me when the product he delivered wasn't even close to what he'd promised and I refused to pay.  Another did such a low quality job that I think my kid could have done better.  I understand I won't get much for $5 but in my case I offered more in exchange for better quality and the quality was still low. As a seller I find there are very few orders and the site is a bit hard to navigate. Just try to find your own ""gig"" for example, even from your admin pages, to do edits. My customers have liked my products and I've gotten ""tips"" on sales which in many cases doubles my income. The problem is the fees charged eat it up. Let's say I have a $5 item and I get a $5 tip so I made $10 from the sale.  But then Fiver charges me $2 in their fees plus an additional $1 to send me my money via PayPal. If I want it sent any other way the fees are higher, in some cases MUCH higher.  So Fiver is taking 30% of my gross income on the sale! If I'd made the $5 sale and NOT gotten a tip they would have taken $3 of the $5 I was paid.  Making $2 for an item isn't profitable. In the ""Price-Quality-Service, Pick any two"" equation you're getting a very low price, but I'm just not seeing that you're getting either of the other two. When you only get one of the three items it's a bad deal and should be avoided. That's my advice for both buyers and sellers... Avoid it.",2,fiverr.com

6779,"If you believe that you are going to get high-quality work for $5, then you are sadly mistaken.  As another reviewer said, choose your provider carefully. I've used Fiverr on five different occasions and each time, I have been disappointed.  The quality of the work was okay. The ability to offer work for $5 comes from the fact that providers are rehashing the same content over and over again. If you want something that requires more work, you will pay more. However, there is a limit to what some will do.  Many seem to operate on a Walmart mentality, preferring 100 customers paying $5 over a client who pays $50, so don't expect to pay your way to a better outcome. Based on my experience, the providers I came in contact with were focused on quantity, not quality. And hey, for $5, what do you expect? Even with the service add-ons, which can push you into paying hundreds, don't assume everyone will provide quality service. One of the things I don't like about Fiverr is that you never get your money back. If you pay a provider for a service and something happens where the service is cancelled or undelivered, FIVVER KEEPS YOUR MONEY FOREVER. The only way to access your money is to hire another provider, and that provider's service must add up to the exact amount of your account credit. If the amount differs, Fivver will charge you again and ignore any credit you may have. Their customer service is almost non-existent. Expect to wait 2-3 days before you get a reply, if you get a reply. If you even dare to fill out a customer survey detailing a negative encounter with a rep, expect an email from that same rep telling you why they did what they did. Nightmare. I'm not saying to run from Fivver. I like Walmart. Even though I hate shopping there at times, I can't resist the bargains. I feel the same way about Fiveer.  There are some decent Fivver providers who will deliver services that you can't get for $5 in any market. Just make sure you read Fiverr's terms of service, and thoroughly vet the service provider before paying any money. Remember, your money will NEVER come back to you. Therefore, proceed with caution.",2,fiverr.com

6781,"Almost signed in and then backed off -- far away. Undoubtedly, we are all used to the EULA that basically says any company can rob you blind on general principles. That's bad enough, and as a freelance writer with 20 years-plus of dedication and passion and new learning in the field, I'm turning more and more ""EULA copy-n-paste companies"" down, whether a buyer or a seller and regardless of what they are selling or how bad I want it. Fiverr(TM) stays pretty even -- having rewritten the EULA to a point where they aren't taking everything -- at least on the surface. That was well done. However, scroll way down to the bottom and you see this cute little statement that says that ""they can use content for marketing purposes -- or any other purpose"" -- that screams third-party vendors and absolute intellectual property control, even though they say earlier that the buyer gets intellectual property. I'm good with that latter part. If I ghostwrite, or do an edit for a client on a business document or thesis/dissertation, then I expect, since I was paid as a contractor, not to retain any rights. Fiverr(TM), however, has made it clear that they can use any portion for any purpose. That means the company owns your work that you either created as a seller, or contracted as a buyer. In essence, Fiverr(TM) gets everything for free in terms of content, and still charges fees. In the words of Kyle on Southpark(TM) -- I say ""Shenanigans!"" to this carnival rip-off. As a highly-qualified writer, I'll go back to my own website and control. I'm disappointed. I heard good things about Fiverr(TM) Please everyone -- it is like having a root canal during a tax audit while seeing your car being towed away in your peripheral vision as you lay in the surgical chair -- but read the ""terms"" of these new start-ups. The thirty minutes you'll lose going line by line will save you that much in the anxiety you'll face later. Companies like Fiverr(TM) have got to learn -- it's not all about them. Not any more.

6782,"I feel like fiverr is really just a rip off. I did some design services, such as really small illustrations. I thought it would be a good and simple way to make some cash on the side while honing some skills. WRONG. The type of buyers on that site, I have found, expect a whole lot out of your for so little pay. You can increase the price on each service you are selling, which makes sense, but most buyers don't even bother to read and expect your highest level of service for $5. Then fiverr has not even given you the functionality to upgrade to the level your buyer needs!! You are stuck with doing high level job for $5 unless you can convince your buyer to buy another level service. The mobile site is even worse. It has about 30% of the features on the website. Terrible. How are you supposed to do your business in a timely manner, like they repeatedly hound you to do, if their mobile site is less than functional? They also send you a lot of annoying emails. You can opt out of some such as the marketing emails, but if you have a buyer who doesn't respond after a few days, fiverr will repeatedly send you emails everyday to say you need to ""work on your job"" and not to leave your client hanging. Its even worse when you've gone past your deadline for reasons out of your control. That is BS and way too many emails. Once you've finished your job, you only get 80% of your payment. So if you work for $5 you are actually getting $4. I did at least 5 jobs and only ended up with $32. Not worth my time. The site is not intuitive at all. It is way too complicated for a site that sells $5 jobs. I really feel like there is too much extra ""stuff"" that gets in the way of navigating the pages and understanding your profile and gigs. Also, anytime you'd like to make a change, a payout, or anything other than adding a new ""gig,"" they make you confirm with an email. So, you have to wait for the email to come, which isn't right away, just to make simple changes or get your money. Overall, I had 10x the headache than reward with this site. If you don't mind doing a lot for basically nothing, then you'd probably like this site. Otherwise, you're better off going to a real freelancing site where the buyers actually expect to pay out for decent work.",2,fiverr.com

Most gigs are more than the advertised $5, but in reality - someone designing an awesome logo for $20 is a hell of a good deal.  That said - the reason I would NOT recommend use of Fiverr is because since I have used it, the credit cards I used on the site were hacked. None of my other cards have been hacked; just the ones I used on Fiverr. Large purchases were made for car repairs, ""donations"", large amounts for Facebook advertising, and several others that were declined. Coincidence that ONLY the cards I used on Fiverr were hacked, and within two weeks of the purchases being made?

One thing I did notice though is that the management are less interested in the Buyer than they are of the Seller.

Doing this means the job is complete and the seller is no longer obligated to finish the job. This seller attempted to communicate with me on my social media sites rather than on Fiverr. I didn't allow this. I wasn't able to use the wordpress website I ordered due to poor programming. This was partially due to a language barrier and several misunderstandings. This was frustrating because when I ordered the job, it was stated English was spoken fluently. When I left an honest review the seller harassed me until it was changed. It was highly unprofessional from a person claiming to have experience along with education in this specific area.  I feel some sellers on this site offer a good product.

6799,"I have been using fiverr for over a year now and it has both good and bad sides. First the good: it is easy to make an ad to offer a service and you do reach a large audience. Second the bad: they police the ads and aren't clear which section to put them in. If you don't get it right your ad will be removed. No one would have any trouble going to the right category if they would just tell you what it is, but they don't... Second bad: you can't just delete an email because the system will mark it as a non-reply. That's where things get truly ridiculous, because sometimes all an email is is SPAM. Beginning sellers won't know this, so they delete an email and poof, your response time is shot to hell. Don't bother contacting customer service, because that is where this platform really reaches zero starts... they suck. Better just wait out the month, because then the scores will reset themselves. On buying services: quality varies wildly, so you have to be careful what you buy. I have bought services I loved and services that had no use because the seller didn't carry out the work correctly. In the end it all comes down to 'do I want to spend a little more to get better quality'?",3,fiverr.com

6804,"Fivver is one of those site where you have to take small steps in using a seller. After using fivver a few times, I relized that $ 5.00 gigs was the bare minimum service for most sellers . The more you want done the more it's going to cost. Yes, there are some sammer on there, but you have to order with caution. When working eith a fivver seller, know what you want. Be able to communicate that in great detail with seller. If you don't give detail of your project the seller want know what your project needs are. Communication is the #1 key factor in using fivver. When a seller doesn't deliver on time or communicate with you, cancel the order and try someone else. It's nothing lost, because fivver will refund your account. You then take your refund and try another seller. Over the past couple of years since I've been using the service, I have had some good 5 star service and serveal canceled orders. But overall, I have found fivver to be a great business tool for those who work on a small to no budget. With anything shop with caution. Some of the thing I've had done: 1.

6806,"Fiverr has given me both some good experiences, and some bad experiences. My industry is book publishing, so I mainly deal with editing, proofreading, artwork and translations. I will list the good and bad and let you make your own opinion. THE GOOD: -the way gigs are set up, you have an idea, before you inquire, how much your job might cost. -the star-ratings give you an idea if other buyers had a good experience. -easy payment options through your credit card or Paypal. -transfers the payments automatically into foreign currencies so you don't have to walk around with a calculator or deal with the daily currency fluctuations around the globe. -I've had some really positive experiences on Fiverr and met some great, hard-working sellers. THE NEUTRAL: -Fiverr doesn't hire or screen their sellers. The rating system is crowd-sourced by other buyers. It's possible to game the system with reviews. -You get what you pay for. Seriously! If somebody is charging far less than others for the same job and isn't a brand-new seller, it should send up a red flag. On the other hand, if somebody is brand-new, you may or may not want to take a chance on them. Give them a SMALL job, see how well they do, before you hire them for something more important.  -There is a 5% processing fee on top of whatever you gig-cost is which is not clearly spelled out. Once you get bitten, you learn to incorporate it in when bidding on an offer. It's not an unreasonable fee, especially since you are often dealing with credit card merchant fees or foreign currency conversion fees. It's the lack of transparency to spell it out beforehand which makes this 'meh.' -Fiverr doesn't differentiate between 'quickies' and professional-grade work. For example, if I need ad-copy quickly translated for a quick $5 gig, that work is different from a job where the translator converted a 150,000 word novel. And yet both count as a single rating with the same weight. That could be improved so the truly great sellers rise to the top. It would also help me, as a buyer, because when I contract for a big job, I want to know the person did similar work. I dunno ... maybe REQUIRE a longer survey for bigger jobs, send a 'REVIEW THIS' email followup with specific questions? THE BAD: -sellers are heavily skewed toward people who want to make a quick buck doing lots of quick $5 gigs, so if you have a larger job, you might end up with a lot of people who are flaky. -You get a lot of amateurs on Fiverr, people who bid on a big job, and bit off more than they can chew. But that doesn't show up in the ratings except you may notice lots of 'not delivered on time - cancelled.' Always look through the reviews, try to discern what kinds of jobs people did before you buy. -If you cancel your order, Fiverr keeps the money in your 'account.' They don't refund the money. You have to use it for another gig. Now this isn't necessarily a deal-buster for a small job, but when you work like I do with larger scale translations totaling hundreds or thousands of dollars, it's a bad business policy. It discourages me, as a buyer, from bidding out larger jobs on Fiverr. -For a job such as translations, where the buyer is completely at the mercy of the translator to do an accurate job, there are a LOT of shysters on Fiverr who simply cut-and-paste your document into GoogleTranslate or BabelCube and you have no way to know unless you hire an independent editor to do a second pass-through. Again, for me, as somebody who would LIKE to bring bigger jobs to Fiverr (totaling thousands of dollars per job), it gives me pause in using them for the bigger jobs. -Due to the quick timeframe when you are expected to pay the seller after delivery and then rate them, by the time you realize you've found a second set of eyeballs to proofread your work and realized you've gotten a translation that is so bad you cannot use it at all, there is no way to go back and make it known in the crowd-sourced ratings. -What gets RATED is essentially 'did this seller deliver on time' and not QUALITY of the job. -If the seller needs more time to finish the job for a legitimate reason and you want to GIVE them that time to extend the deadline, Fiverr doesn't have a way to create a mutually extended deadline. It's either cancel the job (in which case the seller gets dinged on their reviews) or hold your breath and hope they deliver it after you've already paid for it. -For translation and editing, MOST sellers advertise they'll give up to 'x-number of revisions' for a writing/translation gig. However, for the most part, when I've gone back to these sellers to get the revisions (usually simple stuff, the proofreader spotted some typos or grammatical errors) they essentially disappear. There is no way to rate the 'follow up' rate or enforce it. -Fiverr sellers have an unofficial 'blacklist' for buyers who leave a negative review for shoddy work. So you will find, after leaving a negative review, no matter how shoddy the work was, that all of a sudden your quote-inquiries don't get answered, or they'll get answered, but then a few hours later the seller will back out of the work. As a businesswoman, I expect to get what I paid for. I am very flexible and reasonable. THE SUPER-INEXCUSABLY BAD: -If you have money leftover in your account, you can only USE that money if you hire a gig for the EXACT SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY OR LESS. So if you cancelled a gig for $45 because the seller failed to deliver, but the more competent guy you hire to replace him wants $50 to do the job, you have to PAY ANOTHER $50 FROM SCRATCH and can't use that $45 sitting in your account, which you already paid the fees for, plus $5. This is outright stupid bad business policy. Seriously?",3,fiverr.com

6817,"I've had one of the best experiences here on Fiverr. I am able to get by with drawing and, to be honest, the people here have low standards, so most people will hire anyone.

Which means that you are technically earning $4 a gig, and NOT $5. So they should kind of change their site name, but four-rr would have sounded dumb so they went with Fiverr. You also get hit with the Paypal fee when you withdraw your money, so I recommend letting your money accumulate and withdraw it when you have a lot of money. That way you aren't hit with EXTREME paypal fees. It's a better option than getting a check mailed to you for a $5 fee. RIP OFF. I also hate that when I cancel a gig I paid for, they give the money back to you as Fiverr credit and if you try to withdraw it, you get hit with a paypal fee, so it's technically taking money away from you.

They're easy to spot though. Just look for grammatical and spelling errors in their gig description. Also, always reverse image search their profile pic to see if it's a random stock image. If you take the time to search through sellers, you can get a really great value. I recommend always starting with small $5 or $10 gigs first before jumping into big projects, and if you buy writing, make sure to manually type the content into both grammerly's plagiarism checker and copyscape. Some sneaks do some fancy coding tricks to make stolen content pass copyscape, so if you copy/paste it will pass. All of that might sound pretty scary, but you have to understand it's just a platform. The sellers don't work for Fiverr, they're just using Fiverr as a platform. There are sneaks and crooks everywhere. But you can also find some awesome sellers who do great work at a great value.

6832,"It is unfortunate to see so many negative reviews on Fiverr while other freelance platforms which are worse have much better reviews. I'm writing from an honest and trained seller's point of view. Fiverr has ups and downs. It is true that at least 2/3 of the clients are looking for dirty cheap prices that no professional would offer to work for. And, there's probably a bunch of sellers who are doing sloppy work to cater to those clients. This is mostly to be blamed on those clients who think they can get hours worth of work for $5, just because its called Fiverr. Having said that, Ive had wonderful clients on this site and built relationships that lasted for years. What I like about Fiverr is that this platform still has that balance between the number of jobs offered and sellers, at least in my field. If I send an offer, I usually get contacted unlike in other sites where I see 30-50 bids on a few projects. One down side I experienced is that its algorithms are unforgiving. If I paused a gig or mutually cancelled an order (which often happens when sellers put orders for $5 expecting work of 10 times more value), my gigs will take a nose-dive until a past client starts an order with me or until I find a client to work with. They must fine tune these hidden score systems to work more intelligently. Overall, my experience has been positive so far.",4,fiverr.com

6850,"Fiverr.com a 5 Bucks services where you can get stuff done , i would say its a great marketplace to sell your services , if you are too good you will receive a junk of order and you can start from 0 to 50 order per days as well. Some of sellers services are really an awesome , like video reviews , Video compose , some backlink stuff , some traffic , some Google campaign and many more . But you have to accept that , quality will be poor , what make the different where some one provide 500 USD services in 5 USD ? Yes you got better understanding now  so try it when you need to make thing filthy , Not all the services are in this categories but sure some one who give you 5000 visitors and 5000 likes in 5 bucks what will be the quality ?

Beware of sellers who do not communicate with you or ask for your email and instruct you to send monies to THEIR Paypal acct. My best advice is to do your homework. Don't spend $5 until you have checked the reviews and made sure the seller is legit. If you cancel an order, your $5 will still need to be spent on the fiverr.com site. Hey, have some fun. Have someone write you a poem, create a tag line, make you laugh, cheer you up or write your name with fruit!",4,fiverr.com

6864,"I'm both a seller and a buyer on fiverr.com. As a buyer you have to be cautious because there are a lot of scammers on the internet, not just on this site. Most will pull the same scam, offer you an unbelievable deal with a few days completion. They then send you a job completed notice, but in the text say they have started. If you respond without first clicking the button to say you have a problem, you will have accepted that the order is completed. What you need to do it click ""Reject Order"" if you do not get what you ordered, or you're suspicious of the seller's promise to deliver when he or she says it is done. That way the seller either delivers or you get your money back. Also, if you stick with Level 1 sellers or above, avoid sellers that have sold nothing, and stay clear of sellers with a rating of less than 90% positive ratings, you will be OK.  As a seller, you have to be careful to always produce what you say you will, by the deadline you indicate it will be done. If you don't, you may have your account downgraded to a lower approval rate of suspended completely.  I read a lot of poor reviews sighting customer support communication as a problem. This is my one area of contention with fiverr.com, they're slow to respond sometimes, but do so eventually. Unfortunately, if you are trying to report a con artist abusing their service, this delay can give the cheaters days to victimize more buyers. Fiverr.com is far better than most micro-job sites though. With one I can not even get them to fix my log in, which is never a problem with fiverr.com. I am told an email was sent with my new password, but it never arrives. Obviously I do not bother with that site, but I wish I could access my account to suspend the gigs. Others my beef is with the delays in payment for gigs I sold. So far all have paid, but whenever they get around to it. Fiverr.com has always paid me instantly once I did request funds be transferred. As well, all monies owed me were refunded money for gigs that I rejected or were not done on time immediately.  I only ranked the site 4 stars out of five only because they really need to improve their communication, and because every few days there seem to be technical glitches. None serious, but with the poor communication, glitches too are enough to cost a star in my opinion... But what I can not do is fault this company for scammers abusing their service. Crooks online are everywhere, and as long as they are suspended once found out the website owner has done all they can. Anything online is a case of. ""Buyer Beware"".",4,fiverr.com

6885,Fiverr works great for small gigs where the provider has to put in only little effort to complete your gig. If something has to be developed from scratch then it is a bad fit for Fiverr. Even if the job is small. Learning how to do it well takes 10000 hours. The measly pay of $5 to $50 per gig works for the provider only if he/she is reusing 95% of something they have already made or something that the provider is very familiar with.

Make sure you're paying a reasonable amount for what you're going to get, and maybe you'll get higher quality sellers. If you go to Fiverr thinking you can get a whole novel edited for $5 only $4 of which goes to the seller, what do you expect the quality of the work to be? You have a huge pool of talent, and the more talented people are going to demand a better price for their work. You do truly get what you pay for. if you think that Fiverr staff are terribly motivated on behalf of $5 buyers who are out to rip off sellers, you're probably wrong. There are many buyers who are dedicated repeat customers on Fiverr, and do large projects with sellers. I know, because I'm one of them. And I know other people in my local business community who have built up relationships with Fiverr sellers. Find someone, vet them, talk to them, start with a small project and then work up -- both in size of project and fee scale -- to larger projects with your trusted sellers.

6907,"I have been a Fiverr buyer for 3 years and a seller on Fiverr for 30 days. Fiverr is a platform where you have independent individuals (not employees) that can be very talented, at the very least saving you a lot of time outsourcing tasks at the cheapest rate. As with any other website where you hire a freelancer, it is up to you to screen candidates before hiring them. Fiverr protects the buyer and seller as much as possible, but you also have a responsibility. If you buy a Gig, you can cancel if the seller does not deliver in the agreed time. The seller has to mark the job as completed and you have to accept it or reject it. If you don't do anything, the job will auto-close in 3 days as if you agree that it is completed. Never accept jobs that only delivers after the closing date, that does not make any sense to do that. For Sellers, Fiverr keeps your payment for 2 weeks and takes 20%. Amazon, for example, keeps your money for 6 weeks and keep at least 30% of your payment. They both have a clientele of ready buyers and they provide you free exposure or traffic.  My experience with buying Gigs have been above average value for the money spent. Yes, there were duds, people who didn't deliver, but that is a tiny percentage. I have never lost money with Fiverr. Like any other company, Fiverr has terms of service, most of which are common sense, such as, for sellers, no fake accounts, no fake orders and reviews for your own Gig etc. If you ignore these, your account will be suspended. Play by the rules, this protects both buyers and sellers. If you're concerned that you'll lose $5 by trying Fiverr, then don't use it. But also consider that everything new has a learning curve, you don't stop at the first bad experience, when I cancelled orders, I simply got another Fiverr user to do the job. If you're starting a business, try and get the vision of what Fiverr users can do for you. If you're not experienced in buying outsourced tasks or not willing to do due diligence and search for the best candidate to do the job, then this is probably not for you. If you're a business person who values your own time, I'd love to know of another service that is available at such a low rate and high value. Thank you Fiverr.",5,fiverr.com

The ""buyer"" (or customer) must mark it complete, or the website (Fiverr) does it for you after 3 whole days. If you are placing an order, and don't bother to check your messages for up to 3 days, the order is then marked as complete. If you're spending money on a service, you should probably make sure that YOU understand how it works before you get on random websites to complain about it. I have been using Fiverr for 3 months and it is a lovely service platform... IF you know what you're doing. That's why there are FAQ and Terms of Service pages. Everyone is always trying to find someone else to blame for their ignorance and it's frustrating.

The vendors that delivered me the logos more often than not would give me anywhere from 2-11 logos for only $5. That is a ridiculous price. I was charged over $300 for my very first company logo from a graphic design firm. So all in all I highly recommend choosing fiverr.com and giving it a shot.,5,fiverr.com

6925,I have actually had a very good experience with this site. It is a buyers beware but peer reviews can help you weed out the bad ones. I just wouldn't spend a lot of money with anyone until they have proven they can do the work... for $5 that's not so bad.,5,fiverr.com

6928,"I ordered 4 gigs with 4 different individuals. 3 for doing some research and one for an ebay seller site. Two researches' results were what I wanted. One researcher told me in all honesty that she did not have the expertise on that topic and refunded the money. Each of the researchers received 40$. The individual working on the ebay site was a tad on the expensive side (100$) but I got what I paid for and then some. I have not a single bad experience and will continue to use them. This my experiences as a client. You can always find bad apples but here, fiverr comes in as mediator: If you don't like the work you should be able to get your money back since fiverr obviously (reading comments from sellers on this site) is on the buyer's side (whether fairly or not). I had one question for customer service which was answered sufficiently within 72 hours, Good enough for me. As a seller I cannot imagine to live off fiverr if you live in one of the high cost countries. But I can imagine that it may support you if the cost of living is low and a stream of 20$ gigs gets you somewhere. This is global trade for the little guys. Each partner wins because of the difference of cost of living of seller via buyer. I doubt that I would get what I received (quality- and quantity-wise) for the money invested locally (in the US). On the other side, I would not even consider going locally after some pricing research. I would not have progressed any further. So, I did not take someone here a job away, but added a source of income to someone who can make better use of my money. All in all: so far I have had a very good experience as a client and will continue utilizing their service but am ready to find a bad apple or two amidst.",5,fiverr.com

I've been fortunate to have very good experiences with the majority of gigs I have purchased on Fiverr. Since SiteJabber is for reviewing the SITE, I definitely have to give fiverr five stars. I think it's an awesome idea, and fiverr has gone a great job of organizing their interface and feedback system. It allows you to quickly find someone offering their services and see what kind of experiences others have had with them. I just referred my brother to them a few days ago and he has been very happy with his first experience with them. It just so happens that he was over by my house today and brought it up in our conversation. He had an excel program he wanted created in connection with his business and he was very happy with someone he used on fiverr to create it. He is familiar with creating excel macros, etc. (as am I), but it's so much better to have someone do it who does it day in and day out and is able to do it much more efficiently than he or I could.",5,fiverr.com

6934,I'm going through an arbitration case with Upwork right now. It's horrible. The best Upwork does is email between both parties before requesting $291 more so that the case can go to arbitration. It's the worst. I do not recommend using Upwork at all.,1,upwork.com
6935,"I am a working professional designer and thought I could earn some extra money from Upwork. The clients are generally terrible at communication. Countless people have accepted my proposals, wasted my time with back-and-forth emails, etc. Only to disappear and never be heard from again. In addition to the low quality clientele, the site is over saturated with mediocre, untrained awful freelancers. Upwork is garbage and I will never waste my time with them again.",1,upwork.com
6936,"I joined Upwork two years ago because a friend told me about this place for freelancers and I was looking for a good site to gain experience and earn some money.  I immediatly encountered issues where despite my applications, no client was interested because of my lack of experience on the site, thus no profile reviews on my part which didn't make me appear like a trustful user. I gave up for a long time until I started receiving invites to interviews not long ago and I decided to give it another try, so I replied, sent applications... nothing.  The most disheartening thing is the very little amount of money clients are willing to offer a freelancer. They want you to deliver a detailed work without paying as much as it's worth and they even ""mock"" you saying you shouldn't expect that much especially if you are new on the platform and with no feedback at hand. This is very disrespectful and not professional at all.  Other clients are also very vague about what they want the moment you finally find someone interested, sending you references and telling what they need without actually showing you in detail. This will result in a terrible waste of time and again, for a very little amount of money. As if that weren't enough, Upwork apparently likes hiding your profile if you haven't earned money for a while, or used the platform at all even when you're actually in the middle of a contract. You use the site because you want to create a better portfolio and get the needed feedbacks to work more, but how are you supposed to do so if they hide your account from the clients? They don't really offer you the chance to grow unless you're lucky and the small ones are basically treated like slaves most of the time. You want a job well done, you pay as much as the freelancer deserves, simple as that. If you want a cheap job go looking for royalty free stocks and be happy with it. One thing many people fail to consider is that some of us are from Europe and the currency changes depending on your Country. Living in Italy I already face a considerable loss whenever I convert from USD to Euro and if we count the fees Upwork itself takes from the final price offered by the client, you may end up earning HALF if not less of what they are offering you.  If you're considering the platform to begin your freelance career, don't even bother with Upwork, it's a no-go.",1,upwork.com

I asked him to remove the links. He never did. I ended up having to disavow the links. What made matters worse, is when I contact Upwork and asked if I could leave feedback so other businesses would have a warning, they told me feedback was only allowed when payment was made on a project, but that it would count towards the freelancers job completion rate.

6981,"This website is overrated. I think soon it will be bankrupted, because they think only to earn more money. They have $#*!ty support, illogical answers, unexpected account suspensions, I know a lot of people even couldn't register. So end is coming for them F*ck UpWork and all its employees!!",1,upwork.com
6982,My account was suspended by giving the following excerpted message: We are contacting you to let you know we have suspended your access to Upwork indefinitely. Our decision is based on a careful review and the fact that you have submitted a high number of proposals for jobs on our site without many contracts or earnings. --- Do you see any reason? They have limited number of proposal credits but also it was not allowed. I had received two 5 star ratings on the job and was still trying to do the best.,1,upwork.com
6983,"First, they take 20% of your earnings. If you also file your earnings when doing your taxes, remember it's another 30% (in Canada). So essentially working on UpWork you are making half of whatever your rate is. (20+30 = 50% lost) Second, I had a client hire me, start a contract, then go immediately unresponsive. After months of trying to engage them, I decided to end the contract. However, since I ended the contract as a freelancer, UpWork decided to penalize my profile and drop my profile success score by 75% even though it was not my fault that the client decided to fall off the face of the earth. After contacting UpWork, I just got one templated reply after the other.",1,upwork.com
6984,"I am a semi-retired professional who came to the Upwork site with the best of intentions.  So far, I have exhausted my 'connects' within the first two weeks, and yes, I did end up working for one client (more on that later). Other than that, no potential client ever got back to me.  Similar to social media, with its incessant 'you have a message' format, Upwork updates continuously, so it SEEMS to be in a freelancer's best interest to constantly monitor the site. Well, bottom line, two almost wasted weeks.  The one client is proving to be very difficult (does not get back to me, rarely answers messages) and NO other responses from anyone. The point about the client is that even though she is a legitimate person who does need something produced, even if you do manage to get hooked up through this website, it is not just 'do your job and you will be fine.'  Like many endeavors, once you do land a job, your trouble really starts then. But that's life, that's business, dealing with customers. The problem is that Upwork truly makes it not worth even going out and finding the customers.  Right now it is Saturday morning, I am giving about five potential jobs until Monday to get back to me, and then I am closing the account. What Upwork did positive was that it made me very happy to hear from my old full time employer who wants me to come back on a per-diem basis. Maybe I just needed to see what else was out there.  Thanks to Upwork, I told them I would come back, I start Monday.",1,upwork.com

UpWork responded that they do not discriminate and what a freelancer does with their personal time is not their business. However, some freelancers meet face-to-face and could be using Upwork to cause harm or commit more crimes. UpWork has no idea if any of the freelancers they ""connect"" with others are violent offenders, predators, sex offenders, pedophiles, etc. because they feel they have no duty to let you know this information.

Also, clients know that they can get away with paying very little money to real professionals. Translations for 1 cent per word, language classes for 2 dollars, etc. I call that a scam. Also, the people of Upwork, if you don't get clients they ""hide"" your profile, so, they will punish you if you don't sell your services at the lowest price.

As Once if you get hired, Client has Nothing to Do with you Selling Skill. If you are not a Good Salesman, doesn't matter how experienced you are, you will get SUSPENDED! Simply! I have Seen Hundred's of Suspended Experienced (Field Expert) people from upwork,in fact its an Hot Topic on Google. (just query something like ""upwork account suspended"") Client Requires Field Experts, Upwork Delivers them Salesman. This is how Upwork is NOT CONNECTING the Right Candidate! SUGGESTION FOR UPWORK: If someone is Not getting Hired, it doesn't mean he/she is not field Expert, it depicts he/she is Good At Selling! Upwork can easily Improve its Algorithm by Including the ""Test Results"" (Conducted by Upwork) to Determine the Experienced Professional. Define a Threshold, below that Threshold may get suspended (if there are not earning enough)!",1,upwork.com

They didn't accept my profile on their platform never got a clear answer why and what shall be improved. At the end now quite happily working via their competitor's platform.,1,upwork.com

6995,"This site could be good, but the majority of the jobs are junk and the amount of money they charge is way too much for the service they provide. Most jobs that are not, do my homework are people looking for someone in third world countries that will do their job for them. I have had some nice low paying jobs editing and proofing for non-native English speakers. So I proof someone's blog for 10 dollars and receive 8 dollars. Not so great. 100 becomes 80 and so on. Most of my freelance work now comes from word of mouth, Craigslist and other places. Then I get a notice my account will be suspended if I am not more active on their site? Doesn't freelance mean you work when you want? I did not sign any contract with them.",1,upwork.com
6996,"They've really gone downhill since the merger a couple of years ago. I had a great experience with Elance and then saw that Upwork was nothing but a garbage site with $5 jobs, so I didn't transfer my profile.  Then they add insult to injury by upping the fee to freelancers to 20%, on a sliding scale: the more money you make with a single client, the smaller the percentage they take but you have to hit something like $1000 before you get a break. Since most jobs are one-off and under $100, they are killing their freelancers profit margins. Greed like I've never seen.  They also are having problems with hackers. They get into the site easily posing as clients and employers. NO FILTER system to keep them out. UpWork relies on the freelancers to spot the scammers. Disgusting. If it's any comfort, the site is in real, not imagined, decline, per Alexa's website ranking system. See their graph attached.",1,upwork.com
6997,"I've had a freelancer Upwork for a while now, and I've only recently begun to apply again. I had just gotten my first job and finished it successfully when I got an email notifying me that my account is suspended. Apparently, Upwork thinks that the reason you don't get jobs is because your skills aren't right. This assumption is pretty infuriating by itself, given that there's so much competition and many of the clients end up not picking anyone. Plus, why would you offer so many connects + the option to buy more if you don't want us to use them? ""Our decision is based on a careful review and the fact that you have submitted a high number of proposals for jobs on our site without many contracts or earnings. Unfortunately, this means the jobs posted by clients are not a good match for your skills."" This is one big sad joke. Ignoring the fact that they take more than 20% of the money, why wouldn't they give freelancers a chance to build up a client base? Why did they suspend my account only after I got my first job? I wrote to them, sent out diplomas and certificates, they wrote back that their decision is final, ignoring my arguments alltogether. In over 5 years of professional experience I've never had one negative feedback, everybody was always very pleased with my work (including the one Upwork client), and they dare to tell me my skills aren't fit for the clients? Outrageous. STAY AWAY! Exploitative and unfair system!",1,upwork.com
6998,"I had hired a freelancer through upwork to design retail packaging for my product. I followed all the steps required through upwork, including a well-written contract with all the specifics. I paid the first payment in advance as I was asked by the freelancer. The freelancer failed to communicate after that and extracted the second payment out of escrow. When I lodged a complaint about it, I kept getting poor responses focused on giving me excuses on why and how they cannot get a hold of the freelancer and long cumbersome details on what an 'escrow' means etc. My point was that I essentially paid for a a product that I did not receive and the entire point of going through a company such as Upwork is that in such cases they can be the mediator. After a few weeks of writing long emails, I gave up. I kept being passed from one person to another and eventually was spending more in time dealing with the inefficient customer service at upwork rather than my business. It may be a good portal to find cheap skills but it is a high risk model due to its poor management. I would suggest to try one of the other websites, with better customer service.",1,upwork.com
6999,"Upwork allows freelancers to bill you without delivering work and OBLIGATES you to pay them. It is not fair that there is no protection. I hired an app developer for my startup, and he took my money and delivered nothing. So I have no app and loss of funds. On top of that when fraud occurs all they do is cancel the job and do not offer you a refund for service that was paid with no delivery because they continuously state that their platform ONLY serves as a place for you to hire and process payment.  Once funds are released, they have NO MEANS TO GO AFTER YOUR LOSS. As a client, they will only refund you the 10% in fees that you paid but what about the charges that the platform incurred from the fraudulent freelancer which is 30%. They do not even bother to refund you that 30% fee because by not addressing the Fraud they are monetizing from it.  They advertise payment protection and top quality freelancers by showing their high job success, and the income earned based on the completed work, so you trust that this person is legit and knowledgeable. I would never think that they would take my money due the qualities that they portray on the platform. For a long-term project, I did not suspect anything until I realized that more than 50% of the payment was coming out and the delivery of the work kept delaying. Upwork sent me a message stating that this freelancer was committing fraud and ended our contract. Upwork accidentally cc'd me on another clients email that encountered the same problem as I, and they too were creating an app.  Coincidence? I think not. I started noticing that the trends of the scammed clients were working on big long-term projects. Upwork needs to be investigated!  I am looking for a lawyer that is willing to take on a case like this.",1,upwork.com
7000,"Actually i don't like share my issue to others, but this exception since it can ruin someone life and i hope i can protect other clients from Upwrok. I used Upwork and lost $1150 + arbitrary cost $300 so total i lost by abuse and fraud of Upwork is $1450 and waste 3 months time. It started when I post a job with detail description by Fixed Price you can see the job desc on this link https://fileholic.com/share/Upwork-job-desc.png As you see it show $1000 at the beginning but after Frelancer ask more, we agreed on $1150, with bold point it need work on Framework React/Angular for frontend. Upwork has a great support during the progress and i don't have any bad impression about them. Upwork also recommend a Freelancer to me (he is High Rate Freelancer with Good Reputation) and after Freelancer agreed, he start work on it and i already paid to Upwork $1150. 2 weeks later, He show me the sample via link to see the admin page and front page style, but he not work on it via Framework for frontend like we agreed before, so i ask he to not waste time anymore and do like we agreed with framework Frontend via React. After 3 months later, he promised that he will deliver the same design frontend and admin like file that i already send to him 2 months before, but after i wait 2 months he show link the same page and same admin page like when he show on the first time without React. So i felt i just fraud by this Freelancer, he not do any progress since 2 months ago, he just smart to explain but no work at all, also the fact that he never send any files to me that make me decide to stop waste my time with this Freelancer and plan to try find other freelancer that far better rather this one. So i ask to Upwork how can i end of this with this Freelancer, and i already explain my issue to Upwork, and they said ""according to TOS etc"" i must click cancel from job page, and it can't done without confirm from Freelancer side, i really surprise with this funny rule, if Freelancer already send the files or do the work close with the requirement that will make more sense that Freelancer has rights to confirm my dispute, but this one, he never send me any files and never do the work closely with my requirements. So Upwork not give me any choice to waiting confirmation from Freelancer, and like i thought 100% is correct that freelancer refuse to it and demand payment 50% from agreement, and it shocked me that this Freelancer use his chance to against my dispute and demand payment for nothing. I reject it and explain i offer this job as Fixed Price mean i only able to pay that i want based on my description. Do you want pay something that you already describe but you get nothing or see the item is not closely with you want ? So i ask Upwork as middle man / protection as side who held my money from fraud Freelancer like him, and again i shocked that Upwork state they not able to as middle man and there is other party that able to make decision on each issue on Upwork platform, and that party is not even you aware, that party is Arbitrary. When you have issue with bad Freelancer and want to help to solve your issue, you must pay $300 more for fee Arbitrary, again, i felt Upwork abuse and fraud me since they only want my money but dont want take any responsibility if there is bad Freelancer or bad Client on they Platform. So I pay Arbitrary and finally Arbitrary decide to pay Freelancer 100% , shocked by this Arbitrary decison, and i want to ask to Arbitrary what is the reason i must pay 100% to Freelancer and they have rule to not have to explain everything to anyone. So here i am, Fraud and Abuse on the first time with famous platform Freelancer like Upwork, before this i never get this experience with other Freelancer marketplace because other is responsible and they will do action directly for Bad Freelancer and Bad Client so as long you stay good and clear, you will be safe, but not on Upwork. I want make a point or advice from my experienced and you must knew this before you use Upwork: 1) Upwork not responsible with your money as client, from any issue you experience from job or from any Freelancer. They only want your money, once you pay to Upwork, you no longer has rights and Upwork doesn't care if you get fraud by Freelancer. 2) Upwork will not give you any support/help and he will throw your issue to other party that completely outside of between you and Upwork, and remember, Arbitrary fee is $300 upfront. This Arbitrary also doesn't care with your money and you must explain all things from beginning to them, and they can make any decision they like, and they don't have responsibility with their decisions (It's like dreaming job when you can do anything and you don't need do responsible with your action ). 3) Upwork Community and Support is not a support, it build from them to build image they have great platform and support (which they are not), you will not get any help or proper support like on other Platform Freelancer Marketplace. 4) Rather you risk your precious money to Upwork, you better use on other Platform that want to take responsibility as middle man between Client and Freelancer and will not lap their hands to other party plus you not need to pay more for other party like Upwork. While this is the rights of Upwork to lap their hands from any issue inside their platform, we as client especially need careful with their TOS, better you use other like F*verr or other like Freelancer.com This Upwork or former is Elance (probably one of the reason they change brand is to avoid bad testimonial and try to rebrand new to give customers better company but, they really worse) No files, no work you get and you lost $1450, that happen on Upwork for real. After Freelancer win, he contact me by skype for laugh and mock me and it just give my day more worse. Be Careful Guys. Last One: For Proof that i'm not boast, here is the more proof that you might interest to check https://fileholic.com/share/Decision-Arbitrary.png (this the proof Arbitrary that win the Freelancer) https://fileholic.com/share/Upwork-denied-responsible.png (this the One of the proof Upwork don't want responsible with your case even it happen on their platform) Probably after this some Upwork team will try to defend their rights by TOS and blame that Arbitrary decision is final decision that everyone should accept, even the fact freelancer do fraud is the winner. Also If you a Freelancer you can get free money like this Freelancer by abuse TOS Upwork, like you just need show link to your client that which seems to show you are already working, no need send any files, you can also can use any link you found from google, and make your client upset, and once your client dispute, challenge him, and prepare win on Arbitrary level for free money (some good Freelancer will not do this, but this method will use by bad freelancer person, and on the end, Client must pay that when they got trap) I hope i already give you a point and warn you before you got ""trap"" on Upwork. Seriously, use other freelancer marketplace, there are a lot alternative out there.",1,upwork.com
7001,I joined when this was elance- it was awesome and about when it turned into upwork it started to stink....the quality of the freelancers went down and the customer service and interface took a turn for the worse.  I wish there was a better alternative b/c this company has high fees and very bad unfair customer service. They think customer service means blame the customer.... Others on here say the same thing about the platform.  They really need to get their customer service together and treat their users like customers.,1,upwork.com

However, way too many reports of suspended profiles with no reason and too little money left for you after you pay something like 30% in fees and taxes. What's more, should you have a problem, no one will give a s*** about it. Their support is the worst CS I have ever communicated with. Why do we pay 20% fee?

7004,"I have worked with UpWork as a freelancer since it was ODesk and have completed multiple jobs off and on over the years. Since the merger, in 2015, I believe, they now take a larger percent of the freelancer's pay, which I feel is unfair and a lot more than it should be. But, fine. The site needs to make money.  However, today, out of the blue, I receive this below message that my account has been suspended:  ""Im writing to let you know that your profile appeared to contain misleading information about your skills and/or experience, so it was flagged for review. I have carefully reviewed all aspects of your account and concluded you are in violation of the Upwork Terms of Service (for more details, please see the Upwork User Agreement, Section 3.2). Based on this review, your account will be closed. Unfortunately, given the violation in question, our decision is final and cannot be reversed. Please note that it is unlikely that we will respond to any future correspondence regarding this matter"" Now, reading other reviews, I realize that they have actually improved their pathetic and frankly, offensive Customer Care Service message. At least they are stating the policy, of which, I have listed here: 3.2 Account Registration; Profile By registering for an account, you must complete a User profile (Profile), which you consent to be shown to other Users and, unless you change your privacy settings, the public. If you are a Freelancer, unless you use the Site solely as an employee and Agency Member of a registered Agency Account, you represent and warrant that you use your Profile to market your business to others for the purpose of entering into independent contractor relationships with other Users. You agree to provide true, accurate, and complete information on your Profile and all registration and other forms you access on the Site or provide to us and to update your information to maintain its truthfulness, accuracy, and completeness.

You agree not to ask or allow another person to create an Account on your behalf, for your use, or for your benefit. However, it my case, this ""violation"" is completely unfounded. There is nothing inaccurate about my profile.  In a response that I suspect will also go unanswered, I suggested that UpWork revise their email response and consider providing an option for appeal. Stating that their random and completely unfounded decision is final, cannot be reversed and that they are unlikely to respond to any correspondence leads me to believe that UpWork does not value the basic foundation in which this nation was founded (think 14th amendment). To not even engage in proper correspondence to try and resolve the conflict to re-instate the suspension is a first class act of bad business.  I will not be requiring their services in the future.",1,upwork.com

So I sign up another account from my business profile. And after completion of 10-15 hires, which I paid out in full, they still suspend me. What irks is not that they feel something is amiss. That's fine. Gather info and rectify. But what irks is the way they pull the plug. Here is an example: ""I have reviewed all aspects of your account, and unfortunately, you are violating Upwork policies.

For each freelancer, they take 20% for the first $500, then 10% up to $10,000 and then 5% after that. It doesn't seem fair at all and probably isn't worth doing little projects on. (Being cynical, I'm sure Upwork knew this would be the case and that's exactly why they made it so unbalanced) I was on it for 2 years, had about 100 jobs, and spent over 10K and, except for only a few cases, most of the freelancers would have only gotten 80% of what I would have paid. In actuality, some of those jobs were probably lower than minimum wage. I'd rather do things on a platform that respects both clients and freelancers. Also, for freelancers, be aware you will have an insane amount of competition.

Despite being an approved member before (without seeing my photo), they reviewed my profile and sent me an email in about 30 min stating it was not approved because ""they had enough persons with the skills I offered"".  I decided to close that account completely and setup a new account with a different email address to add more of my qualifications. Added my same real photo and again in about 30 min got rejected for the same reason.  Wanting to prove a point to myself, I ONCE AGAIN created a 3rd profile. I listed the exact same skills and certifications as the last account. This time I only changed my name and used a Caucasian (white) individual's photo. Took more than 30 min but the very next morning, the profile was approved!! They have rejected a profile twice because of SKIN COLOR !!

7017,"Since 2008 I have been an active member (as both a client and a freelancer) of Elance and then Upwork (when my account was moved over) As a client, I have continued to hire freelancers over that period, the most recent being in August this year. I have received 5 star reviews on all of the projects I have been involved with As a freelancer, I have chosen not to work for since my account was moved to upwork, but on Elance I performed many projects. Of those employers who left reviews all were very positive and almost all were 5 stars - but the work history has now mysteriously disappeared from upwork despite being there yesterday A few days ago I decided I would try working as a freelancer again. I applied for several projects in a day. Hours later my account was suspended without explanation. After banging my head against the wall with support I was eventually told that I was not qualified to be applying for these jobs because the number of jobs that I was applying for was too great given my work history - exactly how this is related to my qualifications for the job I have no idea! When I appealed I was then asked to provide evidence of my qualifications. I sent them evidence of my three applicable degrees which were received from top ranked universities in Australia. Shortly after I was simply sent an email stating that the review had been completed and my account was permenantly closed! I have an established work history with freelancers - my CLIENT account is also suspended - and now I am unable to engage them again? The ENTIRE purpose of upwork is to provide a fair and safe marketplace. After a business starts hiring people on upwork they are counting on them to maiintain that fairness. Our company has invested in developing relationships and a shared body of knowledge with our freelancers. Suddenly, and only because I decided to start applying for jobs on a single day, I find myself permenantly banned? How?? After repeatedly asking them to refer me to the section of their terms and conditions which I have supposedly violated, I have received no response. Upwork seems to have a grossly warped sense of what it means to have commercial integrity.. VERY disappointed.",1,upwork.com

Ive emailed back saying that im not moving forward to find addtl doc till they can assure me that my id wont be a problem. If i had another form of id, i wouldve used it.

""Do you want me to resubmit your posting""? ""Ummm, no I think I can do that myself"".

Most people would conclude that Upwork is the worst freelancing platform. They are driving their reputation and brand down the drain.

My five ThrowUpWork clients have been very good to pay. The major problem-the so-called Job Success Score. This is life's greatest mystery. For some reason my score dropped below 77. Invites are pretty much non-existent now. ThrowUpWork reassures us that scores above 75 are good. Oh? Every job proposal has the little button activated, the one for a score of 90 or better. They obviously have a lack of mathematics knowledge because 90 is NOT 75. I raised the issue on the message board. The response from ThrowUpWork? 'Life's not fair!' Seriously. But there is a remedy. An email said if I upgrade to a higher-level account my status will change. Not a surprise! First, ThrowUpWork takes 20% of what I earned and now there is an attempt to squeeze more.

Upwork told me they could offer no support in helping me get paid for my hours of work.  Since then the employer has said that he never got my work and therefore wants his money back (which I never received). So now I am being asked to pay for the huge displeasure of having to work for that man. Upwork has had ""technical errors"" and didn't process my first two disputes on that claim.

This platform is centered around exploiting freelancers and ruling out any means necessary to keep them quiet, controlled and working (biblical reference to slavery fully intended). Desktop application that tracks time and work has an option to take regular webcam shots of you while working that UpWork recommends to use (I am not kidding). Platform has full power over status of freelancers profile and can (and will!) block, inspect and pause any kind of work relationship with a client at any time. Platform will occasionally inform you that your account is blocked until you prove your legitimacy over online talk. Support forum is utterly controlled by trained moderators to keep all discussions in UpWork favor. Posts that intend to start out a discussion about improving/adding functionalities that benefit freelancers and clients will just get deleted without notice. Your (freelancers) data is available to public simply to drag traffic to the site and you can not turn that off. I have concluded 3 projects, got highest ranking on them, earned solid money and met great clients there.

Anyway, I finally got to the point where I could take serious editing jobs again and I went to my Upwork account and found they had downgraded my success score to 75%!!! As you can see from my attached photo, I was a ""top rated freelancer"" with Upwork. Apparently, they got tired of not being able to take their exorbitant 20% fee from my earnings for such a long time, so they lowered my score, but you can check my job history - nothing but good client reviews. Upwork refuses to make any allowance for my being legitimately incapacitated by surgeries even if I send in documentation of the surgeries and lengthy PT. Word to the wise: If you value your professional reputation, stay away from Upwork. If you use their platform, youd better not have a lengthy illness or injury.

I didn't want to take the time to figure it out and I figure for a pro it shouldn't be very difficult and fairly easy to do. Now that I have taken the time to learn how to do it myself I see how badly they got burned me. As well as how little they did.  To start off the person who I originally spoke to was a male from India. I Decided to hire him and he says you have to work with my other account. This account has reached its maximum amount of customers. I will message you from my other account and you can hire me through that account.     This should have been my first red flag... I get a message from a female that he he is pretending to be. However having had some experiences on eBay and Amazon and how much they manipulate and control you ... I give him the benefit of the doubt and I continued on. I had to give him some passwords and access to some accounts. Since he's on the other side of the world the two step authentication kicked in.  He sends me a screen shot of the second question it was asking.  The screen shot also said which I caught ""someone from Afghanistan is trying to login to this account"". I thought that's odd. He said he's from India.   Red flag #2.......  again I look past this red flag because I just wanted to become visible in google.  I didn't care where the person was from I just wanted to be visible yesterday.  After I think it was 15 hours of paid ""work"" I still could not find my site in google. So he said that I had needed to do link building which was very time consuming and that would run me $100 a week for 6-7 months. I had said at that point if it's necessary I want to do it but give me a couple of weeks to make some money as well as iI want to research it and we can discuss it then.  I don't have any conversation with the guy and a week later I see $100 charge on my credit card.  This goes on for 3 weeks until I finally cancel the card.  Not happy since we didn't discuss it like I had said I wanted to. I just swept it under the rug and was just going to move on.  I didn't want go dwell on $300 when I had so much to do to launch this business that worrying about it would just bring me down potentially costing me more.  I then started to learn google. It turns out all he did was make an AdWords account with 15-20 irrelevant keywords and post the google analytics code in the section in on Shopify. 20 minutes worth of work tops.  l Again not pleased but I don't dwell on it. It had been about 6 weeks at this point since I had been trolled out of money and I just wanted to continue to go forward ....... Here's what pushed me over the edge and is now prompting this review.  TODAY I GET AN EMAIL FROM UPWORK THREATENING TO SEND ME TO COLLECTIONS FOR WORK I NEVER AUTHORIZED. THEY ARE ENABLING THESE PEOPLE TO SCAM AMERICANS.  THEY DIDNT REACH OUT TO ME TO SEE IF THERE IS A PROBLEM. THEY JUST THREATEN TO RUIN MY CREDIT.   GENERALLY WE PAY CONTRACTORS WHEN THE WORK IS DONE. ALL THE THINGS I ASKED FOR THAT I DIDNT MENTION STILL ARE NOT CONPLETED EXCEPT FOR THE TASKS IVE DONE MYSELF.  WORST COMPANY EVER DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH UPWORK. UPDATE TO THIS REVIEW:  They never replied to my questions on the legitimacy of my bill and have sent me to COLLECTIONS....  PLEASE DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY.   FOR THE RECORD I HAVE HAD POOR EXPERIENCES WITH FIVERR AND FREELANCER AS WELL. THE PEOPLE YOUR DEALING WITH ON THESE SITES KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE GAME WITH THESE WEBSITES.

I have sent them this email Greetings, Trust & Safety Team, While I understand that pruning the Upwork tree is the only sure-fire way to keep it leech-free, please consider reactivating my account, towards which goal I bring the following reasons: - I have indeed been very active in the previous month, that being because I plan to work through this website for a long time and I need to build experience on it, as lack of previous worked hours on the platform seriously hinders success with the applications.  - Apart from that, I was aware of the fact that there is a monthly limit, but not that you can use that up in any way that would endanger your account. - I am also aware that some of my Cover Letters were very similar if not identical, but that seemed normal seeing that the jobs had identical requirements.  - In this time, I have had replies from most of these employers; indeed most preferred to hire people with previously worked hours through Upwork, but at least three of these companies accepted my application, gave me tests already; one let me know they will notify me when there is a vacancy, from another one I am waiting for an answer and I just had an interview last night with the third, who will contact me very soon for starting training, as per their words, that is if I still have a working account with you, since I am not sure that they send payment through any other platform.  I include some screenshots here for verification.  You can also check my profile and verify that, while not being the most experienced yet, I nevertheless am not among the worst here and I should bring no losses to your table. Please reconsider reactivating my account if only with a stricter limit of monthly applications if you consider that fit, but at least help me not to have lost the time and hopes dedicated exclusively to this site lately. Thank you very much for your time and hope to hear from you soon about it.  Best Regards, AbdElRahman And this was their reply:Hello Abdelrahman ElBagoury, I am writing to let you know that we have carefully reviewed your appeal and determined that your Upwork account will remain suspended. We know this is not the news you wanted to receive, however at this point the appeal process is exhausted and our decision is final. If you have any open contracts you will be able to complete that work and receive payment through our site. You will not be able to submit proposals for new contracts, however. We wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. Please note that it is unlikely that we will respond to any future correspondence regarding this matter.

7064,"I bid on several jobs and got none. Then I built my own website and hired someone to promote it. They said they would give my site backlinks. I later found out paying for backlinks was discouraged by Google. Was the five star rated freelancer so stupid that he did not know? So even five star freelancers are not helpful enough to give ANY positive return on investment. I am sure all clients would agree, upwork promotes fraudulent behavior in freelancers, for example it helps a freelancer to do a ""course"" or buy a review (which upwork does not do enough to prevent) or listen to some ""expert"" freelancer who is so incapable that his business relies on upwork to succeed. On top of that, you lose 20% of what you pay as upwork's commission fee, so if you pay $1000,you are actually paying the freelancer $800. This is a waste of money as I found out the hard way, and many freelancers indulge in black hat practices that will lower your site's rankings. Even upwork tests have been asking the same questions for years..there are many sites which give the questions and answers of upwork tests and freelancers use these to pass tests. People who are defending upwork obviously benefit a lot from all this, like Danny Margulies who has a private forum dedicated to succeeding on upwork,and people who regularly write mere words for $125 an hour.

Recently my account got suspended for no reason. when I asked them to provide me a reason then they simply refused and they also charge 20% from each service you provide and also a withdrawal fee and also a very low conversation rate. moreover if unfortunately if you get in a dispute which is not a big issue because it can happen as there are plenty of frauds. in that case upwork again find new ways to launder money from freelancers.

I was delighted to find responsive developers and an escrow system and had my first job completed within 24 hours and happily released funds. And then, I couldn't get the freelancer to do any more jobs. Apparently, they couldn't get the money from Upwork either. I queried this with Upwork and was told they had permanently suspended the developer with the weasily response "".. we are unable to provide details as to why we have done this"". Great! So the great experience I have with the freelancer, upwork decide to bin for a reason that only upwork knows, and force to me to find another way to work with the developer. It literally doesn't get worse than this. If upwork cared for their customers (like me) they would at least have the decency not to hide their reasons.

Upwork obviously approves of their vendors holding clients to ransom for more money. It now all makes sense. The more a vendor robs a client of additional monies, the more Upwork gets paid. If you value your wallet and your sanity, avoid Upwork like the plague.

7072,"As long as one finds the professional(s) she was looking for, the system works. It's sloppy (as of the UI), but works: money put in escrow, the freelancer does the job, gets paid when finished and both parties are happy. The issues come when any, literally any problem raises, especially for when the freelancer fails to deliver: As of Upwork handling your money: It runs back from escrow to your bank account. There are no other options for this. Can't be held in escrow, no ""client account"" in the system or anything. Means, if the job must get done, so should be posted again, it should also be financed again while one waits for the escrow money to arrive back to the bank account... Adding to this, if the freelancer doesn't approve this action (e.g. she was gone for good, so won't be around to do so, or simply doesn't care), it takes a good 12-14 business days (in my experience) to get the money back. As of Upwork handling you, as the ""valued"" customer: If one asks for help, gets the standardized, copy-pasted answer. If one asks for a solution, gets the same thing, as well as an excuse (mostly ""our system works like that""...). If one complains stating this is not good. Gets a negative remark on her account.... I understand those who rate this site 3+ stars. I felt the same way for my 1st, minor project as I found the right candidate and the job was done. BUT as soon as things go serious, investment goes high and actual professionals should be found for the large scale job, the system starts stuttering, the safety net is gone and one has to realize this site is useless, its processes are killing and very, very silly, as well as the support is impotent.

7074,"I am a high profile freelancer, worked for some very reputable clients and with years of a successful freelancer career. I've invested a lot of time and efforts to make my Upwork profile stand out and I did it. I carefully selected what work to show on my Portfolio, I've taken a lot of skill tests on the system in order to prove my expertise. And it worked for some time. But guess what happened to me this year - they asked me for ID and other documents to prove my identity, this process was hard enough because they rejected my ID image and wanted me to take another shot at it especially for them and then resubmit it. I did it and finally after days spent I was able to verify my profile. Now (a month later) they just permanently terminated my account without any real reason given. I received a blanket ""explanation"", that after a quick Google search I found out it was nothing more than a blanket message, sent to many Upwork freelancers, who also ended up with their accounts terminated. I've tried to at least ask for the real reason, but they failed to provide one. They don't care for freelancers, they are only moved by their own interest on the back of the freelancer community. I believe anyone, who wants to start a freelancer career on Upwork deserves to know the truth how freelancers are treated. - you will spend a lot and a lot of time and efforts to build your profile, - you'll be charged 20% (!!!) for the services, that you provide, - and you may end up with a permanently terminated account at any time, with no explanation whatsoever and no possibility to appeal it. All in all I think Upwork is a very wrong place to make a freelancer career online, really toxic for your career development.

I like businesses that are upfront and honest about what they are doing to collect your personal information. My motto is honesty and integrity and that is inconsistent with who you are and what you offer.  Then I got to thinking about it and said: You dont even have {my skill] listed as a skill yet you have enough of those folks? Lets see, you dont list the skill but you already have too much. I am so sorry I gave you my information. I want all of my personal info deleted from your system. Then they sent mail that they didn't have any need for ANY of my skills. So first they have too much of what I have but now they don't need those skills period because no clients are calling for them. They can't even do simple logic or math. Then I said: Your clients suffer because you limit the possibilities of who they can get. I have unique skills and approaches. You give your clients the first people who signed up with similar skills. They should know this. They should know they might not be getting the best because you have rejected everyone who might be better.  Then I said: Why did I have to provide a bank account before being accepted? Are you going to try and steal my money? Now I'm waiting for them to take out the verification deposits. I will flag those as scam charges with the bank. I also wondered if my picture helped them disqualify me since I do look older than 60 and maybe I really am.

7077,"Contradictory to what they claim, Upwork does not offer any protection to writers against dishonest clients. I had a client who was paying me $10 for small content writing projects. The problem here was that for each project, I had to purchase some material which went up to $3 in some cases. As a service provider, I believed I was within my rights to ask her how much profits I will make because of this - Total paid - $10 (-)Cost of purchase - $2 to $3 (-)Upwork fee of 20% - $2 of $10 How much I actually make/project - $6 or lesser for more expensive material And these were projects that took a consistent work of at least 6 hours at a stretch, plus all the actual publishing and other things. Upwork promptly sends me an email saying I asked to be paid outside of the website when in fact the CONTRACT was STARTED ON THE SITE and work was submitted through it!  The client said that they pay direct, which being an experienced writer, I assumed to mean that she had some understanding with Upwork for lesser paying projects. Now I don't know what happened of her but she may probably just start another profile or so. However, one of my sources of income is lost because such a big website cannot protects its writers from whom it takes a 20% commission EACH TIME when they have voiced a genuine concern and HAVE A WORKING CONTRACT.

Posted my job, received plenty of candidates and chose a freelancer based on her work portfolio. Her name was Natasha Korecki. I explained exactly what I wanted, gave her references, example of similar games and I even sent her a document with everything written of what I want. We agreed on hours, which kept increasing due to her not being able to finish on time. She started working ok design and graphics, which I did like, however, the final completed product was not even remotely close to what I wanted nor what she has been designing. At this point, we're at the ending and we're going back and forth about re-designing. Keep in mind, the whole time, I've been in contact with UpWork to makes sure they have my back. We agree agreed on redesign but she needed more more, which she had plenty of to finish and what we Agee did upon. Now, to save me the headache and stress, I agreed to just get it over with and keep the current design. The game was submitted and approved by Android, however, it was rejected by Apple. Once I went back to Natasha to fix the issue, she kept pushing me to start a new game with her. I explained, we'll discuss once my current game is approved and good to go. She has declined to fix it, unless I start a new game. She also declined giving me the source code to have someone else fix, unless I start a new game. I even received an email from UpWork stating that during their routine investigation, they found the freelancer being linked to a group that was kicked out for inappropriate conduct. Now to UpWork. I've been emailing them back and forth for over a month. All I keep getting is ""unfortunately"" this ""unfortunately"" that. I've been dealing mostly with Mark. I explained my experience over and over but I don't seem to be getting anywhere. Finally, he forwarded me to another team. Keep in mind, this was all over email, there is no support/customer service phone number anywhere, so it's frustrating to get my point across. I was excited to get a call from Michelle from the Talent specialist department. Once talking to her, and spent few minutes explaining my situation, she tells me, I only assist in helping with hiring freelancers, but she can let her team know. Now I'm even more frustrated. But wait, there's more. When I asked her to please have someone call me instead of email, she did not sound assuring as she stated, they may not be able to call, as we use emails for tracking.

And the other reps pretty much ignored everything I said and just sent copy/paste generic responses.  And now, I just successfully completed another contract yesterday and received a full 5-star positive review from the client, and guess what? Job completion score remains the same!  All of this for the OUTRAGEOUS 20 PERCENT we pay them as freelancers! What a joke! I gave them countless opportunities to make it right, they haven't had any interest in doing so.",1,upwork.com

On top of that they accused me of trying to pay the person offline, without any evidence whatsoever. The other freelancer I was working with at the same time was a bit better, but I have to say, if you ever hire someone to work on your site, never pay them by the hour.

So you can do flawless work and still get penalized. Then there is the notoriously bad and unresponsive customer service were you deal with $1/hr robotic contractors from India who show absolute disdain and lack of care when dealing with contractor issues.

I am not sure whether this is a good tactic in the long run because they're closing the door for many qualified and genuine freelancers who can offer much variety to the services requested and offered.

They nowadays request profile verification for every new freelancer who is going to get in this website while theres no other website which is doing this. Furthermore, they reject the profile submit when first income to the upwork by saying they dont have enough place to work because already sufficient developers in those skill category. This will be very frustrating for newbies who wants to start business by relying on them. If someone cannot believe, just try it. Its very simple. Once you passed that after 9~10 times of failure, it will close your account unless you get a new job within 2 months which you will have only 20~30 chance to apply to new job in each month which will very few opportunities for newbies. For succeeded one who had hardly get at least $10 job, they immediately require video call verification which is all ok for me but something like I did criminal thing. Actually, there are no other sites are doing like this at least for freelancing area. When you success all this thing and continue work on website, when problem happens like client complaints you or disputed, they will suspend your financial account and sometimes revers all transaction you get earned by working even though you have significant work evidence and earned with your all burning effort. When you request to their support why this is happens, they says, because of your suspicious activity or because of terms of condition or privacy policy and not stating the exact reason. When you are complaint about this when you are 100% right, then they are answering as they have some bugs on their system.(Rare case of course but if you cant believe, just try it). Sometimes buyers are managing freelancers by threatening to giving 1 star rating even did good works which is definitely your effort is higher than 1 star rating but they are saying its freedom for buyers to left feedback according to their experience which is completely true. But in freelancer points of view, 1 star rating is definitely not good for future work award and even more, it doesnt affect anything if freelancer gives 1 star rating to client. So many of freelancers do some more free work to get account reinstated or 5 star rating for future work and it will make you like slavery to clients.

They have a things called JSS (Job Success Score) which is beyond idiotic, doesn't work and basically allocates you a random number/ percentage to indicate quality of work. For example: You can get 5 star reviews from all your jobs and have a JSS of 60% (!) How? DO NOT ASK!

However: - if a client gives you a bad review, it doesn't matter who's in the right or the wrong; your account will be damaged, and your business will look bad, for months. Again, all it takes is one upset client. Do you really want to pay 20% of all you earn in order to work on a website that has rated you terribly in the public eye? I mean, who hasn't gotten one or two grumpy, impossible-to-work-with clients at one time or another? - scammers galore use this site, and Upwork does little to nothing to filter them out from the real clients. Moreover, if you accidently get scammed, it's you that Upwork threatens to sue, not the scammer. You could get ruined by this site. - their site is CONSTANTLY being ""fixed"". The technical difficulties they experience as a matter of course are huge and never-ending. My computer is sometimes unusable due to messages from Upwork that won't disappear from the screen and cover one third of the screen, no matter how often I shut down and restart my computer.  - payments are grossly, unfairly, low. You're competing with people who can, and do, work for $5 a day. That's not Upwork's fault, but it is what happens when a site is global, and unfortunately, finding fair work on Upwork is just about impossible from a freelancer's point of view. - Clients have you over a fire, and Upwork won't protect you from it. Say a client wants you to write 5 articles for them, but only wants to pay you for 1. The client simply ""changes his mind"" about the template and the topic each time you submit the article, saying that what you wrote wasn't good enough, but that he'll give you another chance if you actually write about this totally different topic instead. What do you do? To refuse means to get a 1 star rating and a bad review that you can do nothing about, but which will harm your business for the next 6 months. You HAVE to comply with this dishonest client, working for 5 days for him for the price of 1 day. Otherwise down goes your Upwork rating and your future potential business vanishes! - Unfortunately, I found the other freelancers are sometimes dishonest too. This means that clients can be extremely jumpy, ready to give you 1 star ratings that actually the freelancer who worked before you deserves.

The other claimed to be located in Turkey.I gave it the benefit of the doubt because I thought maybe a global company could be on the site,but no they wanted my online banking id an password and when I said no .They said it was necessary for the job.I told them they could pay via PayPal ,or through the site they tried to press the issue .They still tried to convince me to complete the fake orientation tasks ..I actually had to do alot of research to finish the tasks before I realized that this is B.S. I have since deleted the upwork app an not looking back.I contact their feedback support and let them know also I told them I would just take my chances freelancing on Craigslist at this point.I will now just go back to my original plan of starting a business.

My husband was lucky enough to get few projects however his account was suspended due to high volume of sending of proposal. He also have a high rating review from a client so we did find it unreasonable for them to suspend the account for this reason.  My husband could not even withdraw the money that he has earned because of the minimum withdrawal fee.

7178,"The customer support at UPWORK is terrible. The departments are seperated and the only way you can talk to a real person on upwork with no automated and generic replies, is with the customer support phone line. However, they can only solve problems to a certain extent because the department that handles the REAL problems can only be reached through e-mail.  My account was suspended because my client asked if I accepted payment outside of upwork--to which I said no. Who knew that just by ANSWERING that question, it was considered ""discussing"" payments outside of upwork which followed with my account being suspended. When I asked to resolve this, I only got automated and generic replies from upwork. When I tried to talk to customer support on the phone, they told me that they have no way to deal with this since it is not their department and that I can only reach that department through e-mail. I constantly tried to get through to the department so I can have a REAL conversation to try and resolve this matter, but NOPE. Generic copy and pasted replies, instead of someone who genuinely is there to listen and work things out.  This little mistep caused my permant suspension and ban from upwork. I would definitely advise people not to use Upwork in general. There are so many ""little"" misteps that are hidden underneath Upwork's agreement.

And then they must release payments within 48h and not in 6 days. And why should customer make payment before hiring?

7200,I have been freelancing for over 2 years with clients- not through a website. I tried this out. It's is by far the worst way to go. Clients: find your freelancers by posting jobs on craigslist/indeed/design sites. Not Upwork. Freelancers: find your clients somewhere else. Upwork is BAD.,1,upwork.com
7201,"I, THE HIRING CLIENT, TRANSFERRED MONEY TO UPWORK'S SO-CALLED ""ESCROW"" IN ORDER TO PAY MY FREELANCER FOR THE JOB DONE, BUT.... UPWORK NEITHER PAID THE FREELANCER, NOR INTENDS TO RETURN MY MONEY BACK TO ME. I needed a freelancer to translate some documents for me, and tried to find one on Upwork.com After uploading the money for the job to Upwork's escrow, my account got ""disabled"", while I started to receive numerous and insistent requests from Upwork to send copies of my personal IDs. I knew from before, that almost all employees at Upwork are hired from India, Pakistan and other South Asian countries (most of the programming work and customer support takes place in those countries; this corresponds well to the fact that at least 95% of all the freelancers in Upwork are also from South Asia).  Therefore, for me it was out of the question to send copies of my ID to a private company, where it could be accessed and misused by the frequently rotating staff, consisting of hundreds Indian, Pakistani and other nationals. Nobody would want to have their IDs copied, forged, and then used in human trafficking, illegal immigration, financial frauds or scams, other types of crimes or even in terrorism. After I refused to send copies of my IDs, and asked them to either release the money to my freelancer for the job done, or to refund the money back to the credit card, Upwork's so-called ""Customer Support"" did not do that. Each of my emails with a request either to pay the freelancer, or to return the money, they replied to by pasting in the same canned request to send copies of my ID, together with false statements that ""I must"" send my ID when requested. I don't know much about laws in US, but the legislation of my country Sweden, as well as of EU (which Sweden is a part of), says that no private company can demand private persons to send copies of their private, sensitive IDs. Private companies can ask, but they have no legal right to demand. The only thing private companies can do, is to refuse to sell services or products.  However, for me, living in Sweden/EU, and being subject of Sweden's and EU jurisdictions, Upwork's third-world employees (all disguised by western names, but still writing in the typical ""Indian/Pakistani English""), stated that ""I must"" send my ID to them. Such falsely statements are a subject for legal suit against this company.  As per today, my money (a few hundred dollars) have not been refunded, despite my numerous requests and demands. People behind Upwork clearly have a policy of keeping the money to themselves on the excuse of ""routinely control"" and ""freezing"" users' accounts, hoping that the users will get tired and leave their money to Upwork. By now I am quite sure that I will never see the money again. However, I do intend to draw these scammers into the daylight. The next Monday a police report will be filed on the grounds of money scam, and a legal suit will follow. Furthermore - one could be a little confused, seeing this many positive ratings of Upwork on Trustpilot. However, there is a simple explanation of it. Since I work with IT, I have had experience with many other freelancing and other businesses, many of which, just like Upwork, too have outsourced their operations to India, Pakistan and other poor South Asian countries. Such companies, in order to battle with the high number negative reviews, engage their own employees to put in positive reviews. In this case, Upwork has done a remarkable job. But this only can fool someone, who doesn't know how these scam-based ""companies"" operate. What is the real ratio of positive/negative reviews of Upwork, one can see on Yelp dot com, and here on Sitejabber (I do understand it's difficult for Upwork to hold track of, and try to fake the positive reviews on all the websites full of their victims' complaints). Now, at least, you now a little bit more about the company with a notable name ""Upwork Global Inc."", and that you will think twice before uploading your money to this scam company.

7207,"First off let me say this. I was a long time freelancer on Elance and then was moved to Upwork when they merged. I held a 98% Success score for years, I was on their Enterprise Bench - which you don't know what that is you have to be invited by Upwork to be on. I was an elite freelancer and only had 1 bad review in 6 years, and even that one was edited by Upwork because they felt it wasn't fair. That being said, as an elite user, I had a direct line (phone) to their customer service. Over the course of this year (2017) I discovered, from the inside as an elite user, that two main features of Upwork are NOT what Upwork says they are.  The first feature is the Time Tracker they claim protects freelancers and clients alike. It does not work. It will cut itself off at random. When it does, all a freelancer can do is enter the missing time manually. As soon as you do that, you are no longer protected. All guarantees are null and void. I had tickets open to address the problem for months, Upwork never fixed the problem. They know the problem exists, but has never corrected it. The second is the JSS (or Job Success Score). This ""secret"" algorithm is supposed to show a freelancers or clients success rate. It doesn't work at all. It's complete crap and a lie Upwork uses to draw in new freelancers and clients alike. For example, if a client leaves a contract open assuming they will have work later on, Upwork claims that is ""Neutral"" and does not affect your score. That is a lie, it does drop your JSS score. Any feedback given by a client to a freelancer that criticizes Upwork in anyway will be edited by Upwork. And vice versus. My score in particular dropped from 98% to 88% because of contracts that were open, but had not been active for a few weeks. That doesn't mean the clients or myself did anything wrong or negative and we should not have been penalized. We were.  For a company that takes 20% of any job and monthly subscriptions, these two features should have worked properly. They do not. In my case, Upwork was making easily $600 to $800 a month off of me. For that much money a month, EVERYTHING should work. Yet Upwork knows and has not corrected either of these problems. In addition, the customer service completely sucks. They do not abide by their own Terms of Service. They routinely ban both clients and freelancers for raising these issues. They edit feedback, forums, anything that criticizes Upwork as a company. So at the end of the day, you are paying for nothing. The reviews are edited, the scores are not accurate at all, the guarantees are worthless, nothing on that site is true. If you are a freelancer, you will be exploited. If you are a client, you will be lied to. Period.  In my opinion, this site should be hit with a class action lawsuit and forced to return every dime it has ripped off from clients and freelancers. And that's coming from me, one of their chosen elite.",1,upwork.com

7222,"I've freelanced a long time. In recent years I've made 50% to 75% of my income through elance. During its transition to Upwork, I was working on a long-term on-site job with an ad agency, so I only started attempting to use Upwork in May 2016.  What a shock. My history at elance was improperly transferred. It includes only a tiny fraction of my elance history - and it publicly displays earnings, against my will. I can't find a way to fix these problems. Upwork is balky and crashes my browser. It produces script errors. Sometimes it just hangs - requiring me to fill out a form again. And the job quality is horrendous! Where have the elance clients gone? The type of jobs and budgets I routinely encountered at elance are nowhere to be seen. Upwork job postings are often incoherent. Budgets are insulting, most of them impossibly low and completely unacceptable. $50 for a five minute animated video (with a link to a Pixar clip and a note that it must 'look like this quality')? $5 for an illustrated children's book? These job postings are insane and I find it hard to believe these projects are ever eventually produced at the stated budgets. How am I supposed to become a 'rising star' with a 'job completion rating' if every bid I post is ignored? The same type of bids created active engagement and resulted in frequent jobs at elance. What is it with Upwork's bogus ""tests"" and ""certifications""? None of its tests even have anything to do with the services I provide. The 20% fee per job is beyond the pale. It could be the final nail in Upwork's coffin. I searched for Upwork in the business press. I see it's failing. One fund which invested $15 million in Upwork last year now values its holdings at $7 million - and it says the current projection is for holdings of Upwork to be ""worth nothing"" by the end of 2016. If any company deserves to fail and die, it's Upwork. It's a contemptible, sloppy disgrace and its abominable level of service gives the impression that something shady & odd has happened behind the scenes. The big question is: What will freelancers do once the final large job-posting site is gone? Of course, Upwork is so bad it's as if that's already happened.

The ""editor"" on the project claimed a portion was plagiarized, in spite of it being in quotations and the source properly cited (as per the instructions on the contract). I wasn't paid for any of the articles I'd submitted for the past month.  I learned my lesson at that point, but instead of closing my account then, I just left it, not thinking. Tonight, I tried logging in to delete the account, as I'm currently pursuing other work in the field again (willing to give it another try after 4 years), only to find that I can't close the account.  Even when initially working with them, I was disheartened by being passed over on contracts by other freelancers offering 1/10 of the fee that I was, only to be asked by the same client later to edit and fix the poor quality content the first freelancer provided.

Now I see that Elance was simply perfect compared to what I have to use now. Upwork simply doesn't work: - it has numerous technical and logical issues: so far I reported around 20 bugs (and that's only a part of what I discovered) - it doesn't have proper support for teams, it seems to aim at low-cost individuals and low-budget projects (but on the other hand, it charges 20%(!!!) fee on small projects) - it has a lot of trash projects: it was hard to search through low-budget projects and compete with low-budget low-quality providers even on Elance, and now things got about 5x times worse.

Many challenging jobs I encountered had budgets set as low as $100 (and sometimes $50!), and it looks like they should be worth at least $1000. Suppose you managed to get one of these jobs every week, and multiply the income by 52 (weeks in a year). Your annual salary will never be satisfying. Jobs whose budgets are actually more than $1,000 will have specific qualifications like a 90% job success rate as barriers. I could never bypass them due to the scams.

7243,"I've hired so many people. But what happens is it takes months to find someone good, and a few months later they're gone. You can't find reliable, consistent freelancers. Elance, and upwork are just a marketing company that gives you marketing talk but not results. I was ripped off ($800) by a freelancer. Because I'm not a programmer and I wasn't able to find out that the code wasn't right, I spent months to fill the database... The result is there, the job requirement is there. I'm the one who is right, elance Nor it's upwork didn't do anything about it. And they kept this freelancer there. They didn't allow me to update my 5 star review that I posted for the freelancer.  The quality of freelancers is horrible. If you're running a business, and you need things that get results in business then you won't find so many options on those websites.  There will always be a hassle. Most of the freelancers are not qualified for a real world job. And most of them are there because they can't get a job for the reason that I mentioned.  Plus most of them has attitude. Plus DO NOT BELIEVE the samples. I've caught too many samples were fake. Copies are not written by them, they just claim it. If you hire them, what they will deliver is not even close to the quality level of their samples.  Web developers, SEO geniuses are mostly not qualified. They can not deliver results but they will keep you busy and hopeful for awhile. So basically, in most cases, you're paying for keeping yourself busy and hoping for a good results will come. In the end, no results that bring results will come. Examples about results: - Let's say you hired a copywriter for your direct mail project. After you send out the mails you won't get sales. Despite that you liked the copy. Liking a copy doesn't sell in real world. Copywriters there don't have a clue with BRANDING and IDEA.. - SEO will make you hopeful. In the end your ranking, most likely will improve on crap keywords only, that no one search for. There's a great chance that you pages will be blocked by google for using cheating techniques. - Web development. They will make it half way. What I mean by saying that, either the code will need fixings, or they will put you in a wrong direction and couple years later you will end up starting over. The website will be slow. They will keep charging you for ""extra work"" that was actually what they were supposed to do at first place. Let's say you have a car that need body work and paint work. For a car it's easy to know. Since you're not a programmer, you won't know this. With the website developers on those website, they will do paint job first. They they will tell you you need a body work so it will be great. After body work they will say paint job again. By the time you're done, you will know that your car is not allowed to drive or it's not efficient to drive at all. You'll buy a new car... That's what the hell is goping on with web ""development crap"" on those website. Part of they don't really know what they're doing and they do guess work. And some of the freelancers are just evil they deceive you. The worse thing is, after all these are done to you you end up hearing marketing talks from the freelancing websites.... you can't take anyone to court, you can't have the freelancers to fix the obvious bad work. The prices are not low anymore. The prices came to a point that you can hire a local, trustable person or company for 10-30% more if not same level, but headache free.",1,upwork.com

They had a lot of opportunities for gigs and I made good money on the site for about a year. Then the merge took place and the policies and procedures made no sense. Upwork has no clue of what life as a freelancer is like. It takes one to two weeks to get paid for a job, even if the client put money in escrow when the job was started. The setup of the site is much more confusing than Elance and not user friendly at all. I will search for work and only a handful of the 3,000 jobs listed will show up for that category. Now they implemented new rates for freelancers, as you pay 20% for the first $500 made with a client, which is up from 10%! Then they charge the client an extra 2.75% now, so they are making an additional 12.75% on each job accepted on the site! However, if you make over $500 with one client, the rate goes down to 10% and if you make over $10,000 with one client than it goes down to 5%. Most clients on the site are looking to pay the least amount possible, so getting to $500 with one client would be hard with the new setup.

The freelancer breached contract, did not deliver any of the work, burned 3 months of my time, still demanded payment and Upwork SUPPORTED THEIR DEMAND. The freelancer's admission of failure to complete AND refusal to continue were captured via instant message within the Upwork site. And still Upwork would not return my funds. I am the only person in the equation who adhered to their user agreement. The only way I got my money back was via a dispute through PayPal as that was my original form of payment, and even that took 45 days. Thank you PayPal.

There's still legitimate work there, but it's harder to find, and UpWork simply doesn't care about freelancers. I worked as a freelancer for oDesk for about three years. I had constant work, I was making decent money, and I felt well treated by oDesk. When I had a question or problem, I was treated with respect. It was a good service. That all changed when it became UpWork. The other reviewers who say UpWork doesn't care about freelancers are 100% correct. When it was oDesk, I was a top rated freelancers with a 4.99 rating and I had constant work. After it became UpWork, the rating system changed. At some point I lost my Top Rated status but was never notified about it, then after a while I became Top Rated again, but with absolutely no changes in my status. I wasn't working at all during that period. With oDesk, I always knew how my status was calculated. Under UpWork, it's a mystery. When there were technical problems with oDesk, they responded immediately; UpWork just makes excuses and tries to shift the blame. Their site frequently goes down, but when I've reported it, they've claimed it was a problem with my computer (it's not - I've been a a computer professional for decades and know when the problem is my computer and when it's the site). For nearly three years, oDesk was the only place I looked, but that's ended. I had constant work with oDesk, but since it became UpWork I've had only one very small job even though I've been looking constantly.

For example, it's very common to see job offerings of $.01 per word, or $25.00 ""total budget"" for an 8 page article that would take most accomplished writers a minimum of several days to research, write and complete. I've seen ads for 35,000 word e-books paying a generous $75 (that's THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND words). Of course, anything less than $.25 per word is basically slave labor, and even $.25 is amateurish. Apparently, many clients posting jobs have no idea what writers should be remunerated or are simply taking advantage of newbies eager to get work.

7304,Upworks is slandering and libeling the freelancers with the jss. They need to be sued!!!!,1,upwork.com
7305,"As with the other reviews, I have to say UpWork has to replace its name with either CheapWork or BugWork. What the others say about the hiring is true. I started freelancing on oDesk Feb of this year and everything was great. I got hired for my rates (which was WAAAY above $5 lol) and I was at peace. UpWork had potential specially since the connects introduction. I had a few good clients because of connects but it's the rating and feedback system that's killing the freelancers. The JSS isn't transparent or reliable enough, DownWork thinks clients know what JSS means, the private feedback system is causing freelancers to get penalized without them knowing WHY they were suspended or banned. Just go to the forums and you'll know just how FLAWED the JSS is. It's even known to cause your proposals to be hidden. HIDDEN.  No matter how good you are in writing cover letters or even if your profile is outstanding, if UpWork's biased algorithm goes for the newbie who charges $5/hr then you're dead in the water. DEAD. The most logical way to escape the wrath of an immature client? 100% refund. That's right, all your hard work is at the mercy of a client's dumb remarks on the freelancer. Heck, if I wanted free quality work I'd sign up as a client, hire the best and expensive freelancer, get the work, then threaten them to refund or they get poor feedback. Some freelancers win disputes, others spend money on arbitration to win (around $250), others they'd rather refund than go to all the trouble and stress of losing their account for no legal reason whatsoever. The best part of UpWork USED to be the community but Garnor Morantes and Valeria Kochubei (community mods/bots) prefer fascism instead of democracy so that means no one, I repeat, no one can say or mention anything wrong with the website in the forums. Otherwise you get banned. The others are also NOT allowed to speak of the banned members, as if they didn't exist. Do you know how scary that is? Think 1984 except Big Brother is divided into 5 moderators.  The most sensible of the moderators is Lena so if you have anything to ask, go for Lena and NO ONE else. Lena is generous enough to provide human feedback at the very least. She also drops hints on secret stuff sometimes. Hi Lena ;) I used to think UpWork is the end-all but after the JSS mishaps, the bugs, and the sudden influx of cheap/scam clients (some of which are freelancers wanting to reduce other freelancer's connects), I was forced to go for private clients. I'm lucky to have scored two a few weeks back and they're definitely a cut above the rest. One client is paying me $30/hr to write articles and another for $50 per 500 words. On UpWork you're lucky if you get hired for $18/hour. Heck, with the current state, you're lucky if you go past $11! About the bugs, the site has a tendency to change or reprogram things while it's ONLINE. The engineers don't care about the ramifications of changing the wings of a plane mid-flight but the passengers sure do. They also change things WITHOUT our consent. Like one day everything's fine then the next our message system is changed, our UI is different, our applications interface was overhauled, it's like you go away for two weeks and when you come back you won't recognize the site at all. No announcements, no explanations, 0 transparency with EVERYTHING. Odesk was great. Really great. I miss it like an old friend and UpWork's like the bully in gradeschool who torments every other kid simply because he's bigger and stronger. The worst part is no one cares. I can't wait for the site to realize their mistakes. In the meantime, I recommend you go with private clients or search for us on Freelance Portals. Freelance Portals is our stand against UpWork and all freelancers are welcome to take refuge and get their best clients there specially those who've had enough with UpWork's dictatorship.",1,upwork.com
7306,"If you are new to freelancing do not work here. Experienced freelancers are dying on this platform.  Too many freelancers and not enough clients. Clients are often scammers so be very careful. Their ranking system will punish you and your Job Success score if you make ""ANY"" mistake. Once you are below 90% you will never get work again. Their ranking system punishes freelancers if the client does not leave feedback - Your fault. Their ranking system will punish you if there are any problems with a job.  Bad clients only need complain and Upwork will give them all your money back. Even if you did a good job and can prove it. You'll also be punished again. Feedback from Elance jobs from 1-2 years ago will go against you if none was left. You have no control over this and you are punished. The system crashes 3-5 times a week. The message system constantly breaking down and if you miss a job offer, you are punished. Wording on the site is done by non English speaking people. English language - Masterful is considered the same as Native English?? New jobs are listed as Recency ?? The CEO does not seem to have any idea what his people are doing to ruin this site. Odesk used to be a good place to work. Upwork is very scary with all the hundreds of rules you MUST know. Great freelancers with 5 years + experience cannot get jobs unless their rates are really low. Clients are very cheap. $5 jobs are everywhere and mostly scammers. Customer support people are not English speakers for the most part and can only copy and past canned answers. There is no help for freelancers. Clients do not know how to use this complicated platform. Never work for a new client. It will cost you Job Success points. The overall experience is awful and very stressful and very difficult for new people. I would never recommend this site to anyone.",1,upwork.com

7308,"Just a short note. I have hired over 23 freelancers and completed over 30 jobs on elance in the last 4 years. I had a problem with one freelancer and attempted to resolve via their very confusing process. I could NEVER get anyone to speak to me on the phone. In short, I paid a freelancer $219 for work that was never performed correctly and Elance did not speak with me to resolve. They would only send emails. Not acceptable to me. I am moving away from them.",1,upwork.com
7309,Upwork is full of scammers and cheap clients who are paying penny's for the work. Upwork nowhere stands in front of Elance. UI is horrible and you are unable to find-out which client is good or which is bad.  Please avoid this down-market platform.,1,upwork.com
7310,I had my 5 star account closed without any warning. I was informed that my client satisfaction was low and they would not reconsider my account. That was in September. Since then I have had numerous emails from them telling me that my account satisfaction is low and I should try to improve it. The latest email states that I need to pay a client back $9 as they found I had not completed the job to satisfaction. Fine. I just wanted Elance out of my life so I agreed to pay. Now I have been told I need to do a wire transfer as they don't accept PayPal. So I need to pay $45 in fees and drive a 4 hour round trip to sort out a money transfer. Yeah right. Elance can go jump in a lake.,1,upwork.com
7311,"I want to know which FEDERAL AGENCY I can ask to investigate this group. They take money into escrow and then it magicallly disappears. Freelancers write with complaints about money and completed work disappearing. The site is IMPOSSIBLE to navigate, with tabs and labels that make no sense. Oh! Do NOT enroll or sign up. So much of my outsourced work has been lost, incomplete, late or never even received by the bidder. On a side note, the freelancers are non English speakers who really cannot handle even mildly sophisticated projects.",1,upwork.com
7312,"Elance is a haven for scammers and swindlers. I have been involved with them sporadically these past few months, and I have found that there are various loopholes that exist which make payment assurance rather sketchy. I had one client where the platform worked well, merely because the guy was ethical; however, I ran into another seedy individual and in short, it has been a complete nightmare in getting payment. We had clear terms, exchanged an agreement, I completed the work according to specification and time frames, had the work accepted, and then the guy decides he was not paying. I contacted the Elance dispute department, only to find out that they could not offer me protection because of how the job was set up - it was an hourly job instead of a fixed price. This absurdity now has put me out of receiving payment and was given a ""tough luck"" attitude from Elance.  In addition, bear in mind, that the people that post jobs on Elance are looking for CHEAP labor. A good majority of the freelancers post from third world countries and really drive the pay down overall for everyone else. Once you begin with such a low pay and then have to dish out the +8% fee for Elance you really feel like the place promotes slavery. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this site.",1,upwork.com
7313,I had excellent experience on elance so I decided to give its so called new verion upwork a try. I hired workers for several projects but each time my experince was pathetic. Possibly this site is crowded with fake workers who show great work on their profile but actually deliver crap. Will never recommend.,1,upwork.com
7314,"May 24, 2018 update: I see nothing has gotten better at UpWork since I posted a year ago. If it's any consolation, they are slowly going down in ranking, according to Alexa. They've been in a downturn for well over a year now since they upped their commission to 20%.  I sometimes jump into the ""Community"" discussion boards and read through the complaints, which are addressed by a small hand-picked group of individuals who lie and make excuses for UpWork. Like how UpWork can't be responsible for phony job postings, it's too much for them to keep up with so they rely on freelancers to figure it out for themselves and then report them. That's freaking incredible. Worst site ever. April 1, 2017 update: I needed some Google compliance work done on one of my websites so I ran a job on UpWork and found a good guy who did a great job. That was all fine. But I was surprised that at the end of the billing week UpWork just chunked the guy's hours off my credit card without my being able to review and approve the work done.  So I have to leave my review at one star as they do try to automate everything and are control freaks. I wanted my web developer to review some advice from one of my SEO accounts and UW wouldn't allow me to message him the user name and password, as that would be considered paying him off site. What? Creepy site. Very creepy.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- If you scroll down slightly you will see a review by J.M. Everything he says is absolutely true. UpWork has subsumed Elance and it's the WalMart for freelancers: high volume + low prices + cheap labor = profits for Stephane Kasriel, the %&#@ CEO who sold us out. And they are trying to automate the site and reduce staff, therefore boosting profits. I have an avatar pic of Queen Elizabeth I on my profile, I listed my hourly rate at $285 to mock them and I've never even bid on a job there, and yet I get an email telling me I am a ""Top Rated"" freelancer now and I need to jump to the site and starting quoting jobs. It's a scam!",1,upwork.com
7315,"Elance closed my account for no reason First,they contacted me saying my account doesn't contain original content....without explaining what that means.I've had the same account for 3 years.All 4.9-5 star reviews.And after a week they notified me that my account is closed because the clients were not satisfied with my work...I asked to tell me who are those clients and why they didn't leave a bad review so I can respond,to which they replied they are not allowed to give me that kind of information and that is their final decision.",1,upwork.com
7316,What I recently found is that the elance may have a team who post the project and yes fake projects. Now if we bid on this project there is no response and the connect is gone too. Like this they sell connects for more profit. Recently I applied for a job and I was awarded and after that I could not post any messages to the client. Now this issues happened and i did not got any message from the client too. So to keep my profile clean I closed the job. Now since then they have blocked me. Now how the hell do I know. So Elance is Going to be a big SCAM. In coming days Scam from Elance is going to be famous. Elance Scam as I searched and found tons of result. This confirms that the elance is really doing something fishy to trap users and loot their money throught selling the connects and posting the fake projects.,1,upwork.com
7317,"This's not about scammers or about how bad they've treated me (not the case) I'm not going to waste much time saying how many times their platform is down or the countless number of bugs we Upwork users have to endure. I want to focus rather on the fact that they don't care about their community. They don't listen. I'm going to give an example for everybody to understand how they act: they've introduced a new rating system (Job Success) that's completely opaque. You have some suggestions about how the system operates but most of the rating algorithm is unknown. All you have as a freelancer is a number. Really. That metric's the first thing that clients get to see and you find suddenly that your >30 projects finished with 5-starts are replaced by a Job Success of 65%. No kidding. Your many 5-starts are removed from the forefront and remain in your profile where clients will not make to.  Nobody will tell you why you have such a low Job Score no matter how many times you contact Customer Support and you end up out of business (no discerning client contracts anybody whose Job Success is that low) To add insult to injury the rating system is retroactive and things that were perfectly acceptable before (e.g. closing a contract or having idle contracts) affect now your Job Success dramatically. You cannot do anything since it is already in your history. That's how they do things. So, be careful with these guys. Do use their platform but look out: they cannot care less about their freelancers. You may be a quite successful freelancer using their platform and one week later they've moved the goalposts and you are out of business.",1,upwork.com

7322,"Elance has a consistent reputation of treating freelancers like trash. A simple Google search shows that Elance will not hesitate to go against freelancers and has consistently sided with clients who are at fault. In addition, they randomly close accounts of freelancers that have consistently good track records with the vague response that client dissatisfaction has increased, and will provide NO evidence to back their decision. Furthermore, in their own TOS, they specifically point out that they have the right to close any account, whenever they want, no questions asked and no heads up given. This is a HORRIBLE company that doesn't have freelancers that generate money for them in mind. STAY AWAY.",1,upwork.com

No explanation, except for a generic mail that doesn't apply, and that's it. Goodbye, don't call us... we won't call you.

7325,"This toxic company was all right when it started, but evolved into a flagrant example of the sociopathy currently destroying American capitalism. It has sought and obtained a laughable US patent on online competitive bidding. It has tried to compel honest workers into unethical practices and robbed them of the ability to seek justice though arbitration clauses. If workers tried to leave, the company could apparently invent and circulate falsehoods against them, perhaps without legal recourse. I'd say stay far away, but apparently it's finally closing down. I hope they try to turn it around in their next endeavors.",1,upwork.com

Save your money and time and go elsewhere.

When i asked Elance for assistance i was told that they could only provide me with his contact info and i could persue this matter outside of Elance. So lets review - a developer promoted on their webpage - quits the job and agrees to refund me - instead he closes shop, runs and the organization promoting him, collecting their job fees along with developers payment tells me to persue him outside of them. Elance is designed to bring foreign developers (mine from India) to American entrepreneurs. They wash their hands of the matter providing zero assistance.

I have to say the one freelancer I hired who accepted a proposal did an amazing job. I had one other one who flaked out, and no bites on the 5 other jobs I posted.  I think the reason my account was shut down is ludicrous. Because my jobs haven't led to activity? I posted 10 private jobs of which only 2 people applied for after I invited over 100? I don't understand why my account was suspended? If my jobs are private, it's not like others are out there trying to apply for them. Of the two people I hired, one completely flaked out on me mid-job, and the other completed the job and was paid upon completion. As far as I'm concerned they system failed me, which Is why I don't understand why my account was closed? What's the point of private listings, if you have to have them fulfilled? That's what I had understood one of the comforts of posting a private listing, as that I didn't have people applying for a job without me not issuing it. I had a strict criteria of candidates, of which none applied. I wasn't low-balling either, I agreed to pay their market rate. Was I supposed to withdraw my jobs after nobody qualified for them? Or should I have loosened up my requirements and given the work to someone who was unqualified? Or should I just not post requirements which might not find a qualified candidate and hire a proper firm? You've left me in the dark here with no reasonable explanation.

7345,"Hi, I'm a freelancer who is unfortunately registered on Elance website. I'm a British citizen, and I'm a native English and Turkish speaker, I'm also fluent in French and Spanish. Please see my experience below to see how safe (!) Elance is and how much it protects the freelancers. In December, I was invited by Simi Agarwal from Telematic Solutions from India to submit a proposal to a translation project for a Turkish TV Show. The job description on Elance website was the following: ""We have 50 hours [3000 minutes] of script of TV show which needs to be translated from Turkish to English. The entire script is already written down in word files. You just have to translate it. You dont have to do any time coding or transcription from Audios. We can pay USD 900 for this project. If you are available to start immediately and can write English without mistakes as native English speaker, contact us with your CV."" On Christmas Eve I was contacted by Simi Agarwal who asked me to start working on the project immediately doing the translation of the script attached. However, after completing and sending the translated scripts for 3 episodes, Simi Agarwal asked me to watch all three episodes and arrange the scripts based on the video files, which was clearly not a part of the job description, and it was clearly not communicated to me. On that basis she refused to pay me by relying on Elance website's policy which says ""the client does not have to pay if they are not satisfied with the work provided"". I replied many times and told them that downloading and watching videos was not a part of the job description and that it was not communicated to me. This person is constantly making false statements and already chose the ""Cancel Project"" option which froze all the funds for those three episodes. I would like you to know that this person did not fund Escrow(Elance's payment system for the freelancer's protection in cases similar to this) prior to the start of assignment, so that she can ask to the freelancer to do more work by threatening them with no payment, in my case double work, which was not initially included in the description. And when I refused to do so, she cancelled the payment and kept the scripts I provided. A google search for ""simi agarwal scam"" gives a link to translatorscafe dot com website forum where freelancers explain how and when she was banned from posting any jobs on that website as she was on the Wall of Shame with ""1 as rating. I already contacted the UK police about this person, and also her client in the USA who was very worried to hear about this, I will let everyone know about this process. I simply would like to warn everyone against Simi Agarwal - Telematic Solutions, who takes advantage of Elance policy and steals others' work by providing an incomplete job description to convince people to accept the assignment and then threatening them with no payment if they refuse to do things that were intentionally hidden from the job description. If you have any doubts, questions or require proof to verify the validity of my email, I will be more than happy to provide you with the screenshots of my Skype and email conversation with Simi Agarwal.

7349,"I've worked with several freelancers from Elance with about 60% success but recently I had a horrible experience with one of their freelancers and received very unsatisfactory support. The freelancer is Scoped Design. Here is what happened.  I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO PROCEED WITH CAUTION. This freelancer completely swindled me out of $500 and did not deliver the work of customizing a wordpress theme based on Zeyn theme. S/he is the most dishonest person I've dealt with on this service. I had significant correspondence with freelancer prior to accepting job. Scoped_Design then contacted me stating that one of his jobs had cancelled for the week and offered a discount. Now, I of course know why the previous job backed out. They smelled something fishy. He asked for $500 up front stating that he needed to pay the outsourced SEO team, so since we'd had so much correspondence and he was very responsive I (stupidly) released funds. INSTALLED INCORRECT THEME: At that point, Scoped_Design installed a completely different theme on my wordpress site that I'd requested. This process took over a week. TOOK THE MONEY AND RAN: When asked to conform to original job request he did finally install requested theme and then I never heard from him again. ELANCE SUPPORT refused to assist in getting the monies back. They approved my claim agains Scoped Design but since the funds had been released, they seemed to have just dropped it. Good luck with them if you ever need assistance. I'm dismayed that they don't police their freelancers any better than that.",1,upwork.com

They should not close this account even some bad issue. they can limit feature but I totally disagree they will not close a account. They should warn.

7353,"I see alot of poor reviews from freelancers, but everyone should know that the employers get screwed as well. From the perspective of the one providing the work, I have found that eLance playing field tilted WAY too far towards the freelancer. So much so that when the freelancer doesn't do the work, they get paid. On top of that, since I complained to eLance about the freelancer not doing the work and refused to pay, I seen to have a 500% increase in spam and viruses sent my way through email. How about that. Elance cannot continue sitting back and paying freelancers when there is no proof of work being completed except for a timesheet.

7354,"I hate to say I am glad I am not the only one who got a letter canceling my account. I literally just got off the phone with them to find out why - ready for this one - I didn't use the account enough. That is why I was dropped. Not bad reviews. Not lack of payment. Because I didn't use their site enough. I've worked with them for 4-5 years and this is the first time I have ever had an issue. And clearly the last time. They did refund my last payment but I don't care. This was ridiculous and clearly I am not the only one confused and upset by this. My advice - don't go there. If they can just randomly with no explanation cancel your membership when you have done NOTHING wrong - that is a problem. Guru, voices.com, or voice123 are much better options. You might pay a little more - but they don't cancel you :)",1,upwork.com
7355,"I recently accepted my first job on Elance and I was completely ripped off. I was hired by someone calling himself ""Joe"" to write copy 8 hours a day, six days a week at $15/hr. I completed two days work for ""Joe"" and received a warning from Elance that I may not get paid because ""Joe's"" payment info wasn't set up. Now, being new to the site, I had no idea that people can post jobs and accept work without having any way to pay for the work they commission. I immediately stopped work and confronted ""Joe"" about the payment issue and he claimed that it was a glitch on Elance's systems. This seemed reasonable to me as Elance's Work View program, an app that Elance uses to track a worker's progress on a project repeatedly stopped working and I was told by an Elance rep that this was a temporary problem. Regardless, I told ""Joe"" I wouldn't resume work until his payment info was resolved.  A few days later, ""Joe"" broke off all contact and his account appeared to have been shut down, by Elance or ""Joe"" himself I still don't know. I made a complaint through Elance's Dispute system and waited for a reply. Meanwhile, I googled sections of the copy I wrote and found it posted on a few different sites. I contacted a few of the site owners and heard back for one site admin that he purchased my content through a competing freelancing site called iWriter. ""Joe"" had stolen my content on Elance and resold it a different site. I added this new information to my Elance dispute.  Today, I finally heard back from Elance. They dismissed all my complaints and rejected my claims. Now, I realize that I was partially at fault for not finding out that Elance hosts projects with no security for writers, but the fact that Elace essentially cultivates a situation where freelancers can be abused in this manner is shocking. I would highly recommend that any freelance writers who are considering pursuing employment through Elance do literally anything else. Elance is a garbage company with nonexistent ethics.",1,upwork.com
7356,"Based upon the most recent reviews, I see that I am not the only Freelancer to have my Elance account closed with no warning and no response to my queries of support for their decision. I believe that Elance has other motives for closing accounts that are discriminatory in nature. Out of a total of five jobs awarded to me, I had one review that wasn't five stars over 2 years ago, and yet my account was closed due to a high number of negative client experiences. I have asked for the evidence from Elance, but have been ignored. With the experience I have in my profession, it is not unusual to command as much as $250 per hour. My profile was set up with a rate of $55 per hour, but most invitations I receive rarely exceed offers for $10 per hour. I believe my refusing to bid on invitations for jobs that offer to pay $3-$10 per hour might be what Elance considers a high number of negative client experiences. Based upon my belief, this is no excuse for closing an account because I should be afforded the opportunity to decline low budget jobs. Does Elance close accounts for employers that offer rates well below minimum wage? I haven't seen any negative reviews by employers having their accounts closed because on negative Freelancer experiences, so the answer must be NO. Do they close accounts of employers that rarely or never award jobs? The answer is NO. I've seen employers that have over 30 offers posted, and have only awarded 1 job. Elance is a California based company that should not discriminate against Americans for not bidding or accepting well below market or minimum wage rate job offers. THEIR ACCOUNT (Website) SHOULD BE CLOSED! Maybe Freelancers should use Elance to hire an attorney to initiate a Class Action Lawsuit against Elance.",1,upwork.com
7357,"Okay so I had a user account for close to 3 years. One fine day one customer places a dispute against us saying we didn't work as she desired. We showed all proof. At the most Elance could have refunded the money. No what they did was terrible and hard to believe. They asked us to complete the pending stuff (which we said was extra and not in job scope). They said some bonus was paid to us (for different stuff and not this) and hence you have to complete the job now and they also suspended us from accepting any further jobs. Fine working hard within 3 days we did complete what was pending. Client happy. She went away with her project. Now here comes the trouble. We now asked them to restore our account. They simply refused and said our behaviour had problems and this is not the way to treat a customer. We simply don't understand having worked 3 years with more than 200,000 USD business and over 300 positive reviews and only 1-2 negative reviews how come we had behaviour problems all of a sudden. And also why not have the dispute process properly complete and why intervene in between and suspend our account. I thought dispute process was real and Elance is only a third party. But now you sound more of a biased business. Alright so our profile now closed our regular customers we shifted to a newly formed Elance account. We initially just accepted only their work. But as work kept on flowing in and reviews and earnings increased we got more new clients and then again we started bidding. Our profile became again as awesome as the previous one in 2 years and we were starting to think we can rely on Elance now. Sorry here comes the bummer!!! We did 1 job 3 months back for which the client chargeback and Elance sent us message that we have to refund back $1500. But hey Elance.com has Escrow system and you are supposed to protect us from all this. But they simply put the charge on us and said this job doesn't qualify for Escrow protection. In normal circumstances any freelance is protected for upto $2500. But what is normal? Working for 1 month, getting paid and reviewed and then Elance won't protect is it normal?? Again account gets closed!!! Long story Short: Avoid them if you can and have other options. Never ever rely your business on Elance.com This is a real story.

7359,"Elance was great at first but I got notice that my account was closed due to ""too much negative feedback."" First off, I had a solid 5 stars on my reviews with clients saying that they would love to work with me again. Out of 10 projects that I worked on, I had two that I personally disputed.  Client number one and I MUTUALLY decided (based on her lack of direction and my inability to pull more information out of her) that her going with another designer would be beneficial. That was MY idea.  Client number two disappeared completely. We had our first meeting, discussed workflow and payment and then they stopped responding to me. I called, emailed through Elance... nothing. So I closed the project because I didn't want an open project that was going nowhere.  These two reasons are why Elance closed my account WITHOUT talking with me about it first. I received the email this morning and when I emailed them back asking for evidence, they responded saying ""once it's closed it cannot be reopened."" I replied with ""I wasn't asking you to reopen my account, I was asking you for evidence."" Elance, I'm disappointed in you. I was a paid member and you didn't even have the decency to contact me to come to a resolution?

I had successfully completed more than 120 projects over elance and I had 5 out of 5 rating. One day my account was suddenly suspended by elance. I contacted to elance support team about this issue, one of the elance support team guy told me that, It is suspended due to having multiple accounts on elance and he send me a long list of usernames and told me that all these accounts are belonging to me. I shocked by seeing this long list, some of these accounts belong to my friends and relatives.  I requested him humbly with all the necessary information that, I have only one account on elance and I am using it since 2 years, I don't have any other account on elance. I also told him that if you found any account belongs to me please delete all these accounts. But, besides look into the issue he always send me the computer generated replies. I requested him many times, but he always denied me to reinstate my account. I also requested him that, if you can't reinstate my account, please delete my current account and other such accounts, and allow me to create new account. But he never addressed my request. I again requested him with few questions but he never addressed these questions and didn't reply back to me. The questions were; Q) When this suspension will end, is it for specific time period or for lifetime? Q) If you can't reinstate my account then when I will be able to create new account on elance or am I unable to create new account on elance for lifetime? Q) If you can't reinstate my account for life time and can't allow me to create new account then please send me the login credential of other account, you believe it belongs to me?  At last, I never heard any positive response from them, I again requested them to at least only enable my elance login. Because I have moved to Dubai from my home country for searching job, and I am unable to show my employer company to my last 2 years work history. My login details are not working it always showing me a message that my account has expired, and my profile is not showing publically. If at least my account login will work then I can show my employer company my previous 2 years work history. I am not the only or single victim of this situation, you may find many of the peoples over internet facing same difficulties. You may earn money from elance, but you can't rely on them for career building and life longing work.

7368,"It's an unprofessional site with little good work to go around. If you're a writer/graphic designer, there are far too many unserious, cheap clients who want the world but are only willing to pay $20.  The system is set up to help clients, not freelancers. If you want to bid on a project (which most of the time costs you money by way of their ""Connects"" system) in more than one category (such as design AND marketing) then you have to pay monthly for a membership plan. It's just a blatant money grab from hopefully young professionals. But once you join, you realize the jobs are of such poor quality, there's no point even bidding.

7370,"SPAM / FRAUD warning about Elance user JohnVT a.k.a. vermontinternetdesign  We posted a Job offer on Elance ""WP Ecommerce Customization""  This job has been carefully reviewed by specialists and very well documented before we posted it to the Job offers on Elance.  Every bider received the complete documentations as well as all the source code and databases to have a look into it before agreeing on the job. JohnVT was one of the bider and stated he can do this (after reading the documentation and reviewing the source codes.) within time and for the offered amount, so i awarded him. http://www.vermontinternetdesign.com/  Shortly after awarding JohnVT from vermontinternetdesign he started to ask for more money, which i denied, as i had clearly stated the budget and he agreed upon that. During this 2 months JohnVT never informed me about the progress and just sent sloppy and grumpy 1 line answers back by email.  I explained more than one times to him, that this project is very important to me and my business and i will loose money every day if it will be any longer postponed. Again, no reaction from him except ""Due date end of May"". On the very last day / Deadline he updated the project with ""Need some more days"", without any explanation and nothing. I offered him to present a more or less working project by next Monday and another 4 days to eliminate errors and flaws.  After that he comes up and suddenly states ""Job is not possible to complete. Client wants to do something that simply cannot be done"".  He did not accept this offer and said he will need more time. The only thing we could offer him was to refund the $500 he got from us and we will cancel the job without taking any further actions.  John Anderson ( vermontinternetdesign ) answered as follow : ""There are no refunds. Nor do I plan on sending you any thing. I applied the balance onto time spent on this project.""  We guarantee that John Anderson ( vermontinternetdesign ) never ever delivered one single line of code or anything else for that project. There is no work that has been done as he by mistake stated in a earlier email.  We have lost 2 full months of time to open up our business because of JohnVT ( vermontinternetdesign ) and therefore lost 2 full months of income from it. We have family and bills to pay and JohnVT did a lot of Damage to us with his ignorant and disrespectful behavior.  All the details described earlier can be proved by email conversationand the jobs workroom comments and documents. If you need any further proof, please let me know.  I would never write a fraud warning without beeing 100% sure this company knew from the first day on that they will never deliver any work and they feel beeing save as we are overseas.

I have absolutely no objection to compensating any intermediary that helped us find a way to work together. But with my brief experience with them there is no way I would enter a business relationship with Elance. After a series of baffling and maddening interactions with them over the past week, and twice waiting 15 to 20 minutes on hold, I now find: In addition to their bizarre ""credit card authorization process"" (unlike anything anywhere else in the use of a credit card), it is their actual policy to charge an amount to my credit card in excess of what I authorized! They actually think that's OK by condescendingly reassuring me after the fact that there will be a refund ""in 10 days or so""!  (The California BBB will be fascinated to learn about this, and there may even be a young Assistant DA in or around Mountain View looking for an interesting way to spend a month or two.) I know incompetence, arrogance, and an ethical tin ear when encounter them. When things start out rife with these ""little early signs"" it never gets better, only worse.

Spammers and Scammers on elance.com can be found with almost every claimed job posting. Individuals claiming to need WordPress and SEO help. What these folks that are doing is posting false jobs, and are looking for free advise to solve there own problems. Elance.com allows jobs to be posted for violations of all kinds of work ethics. Back linking services about on e-lance, find me a 1000 facebook friends are a small example of the fact the elance.com does not care about what is posted on its site just about money. Lets talk about money, elance.com takes it from all sides, a % from the person posting the job, a commission from the freelancer a whopping 8% . I figure on every job awarded elance.com is skimming at least 12% off the top. Almost as bad as Paypal. In order to bid on jobs you have to buy connections and must pay to be in categories or the services you want to supply. What starts as a FREE deal on elance can quickly have you shelling out over 70 a month in membership fee to be able to bid on 60 projects. Projects largely posted by spammers and scammers. So what you may say, well for example elance.com lets unproven SEO talent use SEO Schemes to have a client land on the first page of Google and I mean elance.com has thousands of these back link Schemes offer by this claimed Freelance talent base. So I have an SEO freelance company do this to my site. It destroys your web sites on line ranking and credibility and the cost to repair will be far greater then the cost you paid to be hooked into this Scheme. Beware of elance.com the complaints clearly speak for what this site is all about complaints about elance.com",1,upwork.com

Elance didn't even read the dispute, told me to pay $133 to some other website to dispute it? WTF? When I contacted Elance they said ""Elance is not a legal decision-making entity and therefore cannot investigate the facts or judge who is right or wrong. Elance cannot decide how funds should be divided between the parties."" WHAT THE F?? What good is using elance if they can't refund money? Isn't that the entire point of using elance, that if the freelancer does nothing i can dispute it and get a refund? I might as well just hire anyone online and not even use elance, refund policy is the same.",1,upwork.com

They can only do this once every 10 jobs had ended and after 90 days."" So my written feedback and scoring left for a provider was deleted by the provider. I wasted my time crafting my considered feedback, and now prospective clients to this supplier will be none the wiser. What a JOKE upwork's feedback system is!

Dear Clients: When choosing a freelancer, please look past the JSS and perform substantive interviews, ask the freelancer about the low score, but above, all please don't decide against someone based on a questionable scoring system. As for the fee, I'm no longer willing to hand over hundreds of dollars to the site just because it provides a forum to find projects--and with a good number of the projects never awarded, posted by unverified users or outright scams this benefit is of somewhat dubious value.",2,upwork.com

Total invasion of privacy and feels like the employer is standing over your shoulder. Also, they have to ""review"" your account and it takes 24 hours+ to do so, which will make you loose opportunities to other bidders for lucrative jobs. There's a way better way to do this that respects the privacy of the users and doesn't tie their hands so much.

If I would have known how much it has changed, I never would have worked through them again. On a $600 check, they take $120 in FEES!!! I will never do another contract through upwork. You do all the work, and they get 20% of your money. They wonder why people meet outside on Skype or something and then become a contractor outside of the network, just in case they don't know why yet, it's your crazy, outrageous, government-like fees!! They literally take 20% of your money until you make over $600, and then they take 10% of your money! This is not including taxes or anything else. Trust me, use upwork for the contacts, and then ask the employer for a separate agreement outside of them.

Upwork has screen shots of my work plus a copy of the completed work yet used a technicality to avoid payment. It is my belief that THERE IS NO ARBITRATION. Upwork will always side with the client. I placed a call to a ""Dispute Resolution Specialist"" who knew only enough to read from a prepared script. He was, of course, in India and had no ability whatsoever to interpret the dispute.

Upwork claim that they have buyer protection in place, but their system to refund is flawed and doesn't make sense for the workflow of any business.

I completed the project end of April and the client authorized the $1,500 payment in early May, then Upwork notified me that due to unspecified ""issues"" with the client's account, they will not transfer funds to my bank, ""in case we need to reverse funds from your client's payment that do not qualify for the Upwork Payment Guarantee.""

The major drawback was the amount of time I spent researching the articles I was writing. I would spend 3/4 of my day doing research for between 2 and 4 articles each day. I have since been asked to do many, MANY jobs that pay less than $1 per 100 words. I am not going to spend my precious time researching an article to make that amount of money. Being a writer is something that is part of who we are. It is an art and we should be paid accordingly. I will also say that the number of scam artists on this site is staggering! I have been approached by a group trying to get my bank information at least 8 times in 6 months. You have to be so careful with these people, it is really easy to get fooled. And, the first time I got scammed, Upwork suspended MY account because they said I didn't perform the job correctly! I do not like having to research each job because the scammers are so prevalent.

Notifications are not sent for new messages, payments, etc, it's kind of routine. Their site fails to load all too often.Worst of all, they have the lousiest IT and customer services people, who would just keep giving you lolly-pops without actually solving the problems. My last complaint has been pending with them for more than 2 months, and they have failed to resolve the issues. This was their technical side. Now, coming to the business. Ever since they merged with Elance, they have become the lousiest place to get work. I mean, I'm among their top 10% contractors. Yet, I hardly receive one invite in a couple of weeks. I need to send at least 50 applications before I get a single reply. Frankly, I'm lucky to have made some long term clients in the times of oDesk. Upwork is utter trash.

It is up to the freelancer to refund my money and I'm 100% sure they will not refund my money. Elance has no process for dealing with fraud after escrow is released and since I didn't know much about search engine optimization, I believed the freelancing company I hired.

That just ruins my rep for any future clients. Client ratings are too subjective and the rates offered freelancers are way below market value. I would not recommend elance to anyone in the U.S. or, at best, only submit proposals to U.S. or European-based clients.",3,upwork.com
7430,"You can find some legit gigs on here, but you have to be careful because there are a lot of scams. I've started using prodigitalnetwork.com, which I like because it is solely based out of the US.

7433,"I found my web dev on Upwork and now he works full-time for me. That's the good news, it took about five tries to find him and one was a pure scammer. It's a caveat emptor world and if you're naive you'll most likely get burned. That said, there is some strong talent on the platform. Key to getting full value is to move your provider to a private platform and avoid the fees. I used Elance for about 8 years before Upworks bought them out. Platform seems about the same. For the record, I've had my most luck with Eastern European coders and have had no luck with Indians and Pakis. The Russians can be hit and miss, I sense the stench of scam when I work with most of them.",4,upwork.com

7435,"My Upwork experience started from March, 2018. I used to have up to ten clients. But the one was strange. It was Emma Serlin. Firstly, she asked to prepare the transcription without opening a contract. Secondly, she said that the result was great and opened the contract in order to pay for the previous file. Then she asked for another transcription and suddenly ended the contract with low feedback. After I asked her what was wrong, she said that she was not satisfied with the results. I can't understand, why she didn't say that she didn't like something when she actually did not like and asked for changes. I don't think this is reasonable. Be aware of such kind of employers, who can make a poo to your job success score.",4,upwork.com

The only problems are that the site goes down more often than I'd like, and it would be nice if they had more payment options in addition to Payoneer and PayPal. They seem honest and aboveboard, the clients I've worked with have nearly always been viable and easy to work with, and their payment process is very straight forward. In addition, I must add that their customer service department has always been exemplary whenever I've had a problem. All in all, I've had a good experience with the company going on almost 6 years now and I intend to continue working with them for the foreseeable future.",4,upwork.com
7439,I've been doing some work for the past 6 mos with UpWork and during that time have been invited to work on jobs that were scams at 10 times. UpWork does pretty good trying to screen them but I think they could do better. Only thing is until a scammer gets a sucker some people may find it hard to tell they are job scammers. UpWork has a way to contact them and they answer pretty quickly so that's better than freelancer.com that scammers run wild on. It's too bad there are so many dishonest people. I just want to work a little to add to my disability but I guess that's too much to ask for in this troubled world.,4,upwork.com

7444,"The platform is buggy and slow. Still, is is the largest freelancing site in terms of user base. With the acquisition of Elance, they are the only place to go. Enlace had way better interface, though Upwork still has some nice things, such as multiple categories for users. As in most freelancing sites, the top 10% are getting 80% of gigs. The lower 10% gets another 10% of gigs, and the 80% down below gets 10% of gigs. It is very competitive, and many gigs are never awarded. Amateurs will not survive there, but pros can use it for certain amount of income.  It varies, as some months you earn a lot, others you earn nothing. I would not recommend to depend on it for your single income source until you have a killer profile and reputation. If you are really a pro and are willing to put up the time to create a killer profile, market it, study your competition, study market prices within Upwork, work and gather reviews for your profile, it can be a good income source. It can take anywhere from 6-18 months, depending if you are on it full time or part-time.",4,upwork.com

7450,Elance got me started writing professionally. I made sure my proposals stood out from the rest And I was able to gain a couple of good writing jobs that have been paying very well. There is a lot of competition on Elance but if you take the time to write a good proposal and show them just what you can do then you should be able to get what you're looking for. The fee they receive is a little bit high but if it wasn't for elance I wouldn't be making the money that I am making today.,4,upwork.com

Some change defiantly is required in your policy which is unfair towards freelancer who actually work on it. Because of your policy we have lost around 300$. this thing is never traced on elance. Good site to work :)",4,upwork.com
7455,Good resource.,4,upwork.com
7456,"As a freelancer, I have had no problem with this website before. I see many people complaining about safety concerns, but I've never even thought of relying on Elance to protect me. Elance is simply to get me in touch with prospective clients. You have to make sure to take steps necessary to protect your money and work on your own. They do have some useful services (such as Escrow and WorkView), and while they have their faults, a bit of caution will keep them from being abused. I never send full copies of my work until the Escrow is funded, but I also don't ask for it to be funded until it's completed on my end and give frequent notice of my progress; if your freelancer doesn't do this, then ask for them to do so through the job. If a job is cancelled, I also keep a copy of it and make regular checks (usually once a month) to see if anything I sent has been posted elsewhere; if it is, I just issue a DMCA take-down notice and harass them (without the help of Elance) until they take it down and stop using it online. Most of the bad experiences listed here spawn from people putting way too much faith in a single website with their money. YOU need to learn to take the initiative necessary to keep your work and money as a freelancer safe. Elance is there to help you meet people and take some simple jobs - not to be your mother. A lot of people also seem bitter about disputes not being in their favor when they very well should not be. If the client specifies you are to do something or use something specific, if you don't do this and don't warn them beforehand, then of course they're not going to pay you. If a professor tells you to type something and you hand it in written, of course he's just going to put it in the trash can next to his desk. You need to follow the directions of the clients to ensure nothing is against you.  You should also go through the ToS with a fine-tooth comb to avoid having your account closed. ""But it should be clearer!"" The ToS is fairly clear, but let me guess... you haven't read it? You oughta at least do that if you're putting your time and money into a website for freelancing, whether it's Elance or anything else.",4,upwork.com
7457,"I've been using this site for a few weeks now, but have already made some money and am working another job from it right now. I would recommend it for freelancing individuals because the free account is truly free, there's a minimum of upgrade to a pay account reminders, and the people who use the site seem more willing to work with new talent on the site.",4,upwork.com
7458,Elance is considered by many as one of the most popular online destination to find freelance work or outsource jobs to freelancers from across the globe. I believe that running such a website must be a very difficult task. Employers want to hire the best possible candidates for a job and the job seekers want the best possible price for their work. Elance provides these two parties a platform to develop strong business relationships.,4,upwork.com

7486,"With the very challenging economic climate, the un-availability of suitable jobs and the challenges of commuting to work if you are employed, more and more persons are seeking work at home opportunities, this is a well known fact. As a result of this there are many scammers out there who would stop at nothing to fleece on the innocent who are seeking legitimate work at home opportunities, jobs to do on the internet, at home.  I personally have known of individuals who are actually allowing others to pay them money just to give them one or two of these legitimate sites. I am one such person. I actually paid $JA10,000 just for someone to show me one of these sites and navigate me through it, this I could have done myself if only I knew of the website. I spent many hours, days, months and money seeking legitimate Internet Income opportunities, at one point I almost gave up because it is not a very easy task. It takes a lot of time, effort and energy to search websites to locate legitimate work at home income. I only discontinued my search when I learnt about upwork.com. It is a Website where you can find Freelancers to do any jobs you want done. These jobs can be done at any time, anywhere. Whereever you are in the world you can be registered on upwork to find available jobs that suits your profile, whether it's Data Entry, Typing, Executive Assistant jobs, Website building, Transcribing, you name it, it's there on upwork. If you want somone to do your job for you or you want to do a job for someone, the site is for all. I have registered on the site, I am now employed full time so I do not get the chance yet to really actively seek a job, I will soon but I know of invividuals who are making a comfortable income on this site. I will not tell anyone they will get rich if they register on this site but I can tell you if your profile is attractive and you spend quality time reviewing and working this site you will have success. So all those who are asking you for money to register on a website or to get an application from them that will help you to make thousands per day or week, I say thats an hoax, beware of those sites. Legitimate websites are usually free to sign up and they do not promise anything that sounds too good to be true. You have to work hard on upwork to accomplish your desired goal, that is of making a satisfactory income.IF IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE IT IS NOT TRUE.",5,upwork.com

I don't have time to make portfolio or perform tests but I have lot of to show or to say. Also I like Elance that it clearly states where I am from thus it takes me advantage in competing with Indian developers - I have several times was chosen only by the fact that I'm not from India. I can't point out some real downsize, there are lot of frustration about Elance because they rule out conflict into someone else favor, but it's natural - some one win an argue some one don't, who don't win - complains. At least there is some arbitration and you have a chance to win. For example at freelancer.com you don't have any possibility to initiate investigation if you wasn't paid. I don't think that this is real disadvantage of Elance.  And also - no withdrawal waiting time, no hidden fees, fees are paid ONLY when you has been paid.

These requesters follow a self serving ethic presumably motivated by the ease with which they can reject work and save themselves the fees they have already agreed to and are required to pay. A stiffed worker has no recourse through Amazon. There is no appeals process or investigation by Amazon. A requester can only be reported before the worker has any experience with her and only for a very narrow range of complaints evading work payment is not one of them. It gets worse. The rejection and any untrue reason(s) provided by the requester through the automated Amazon system in bad faith have a deleterious impact on the profile of the workers who have already been denied payment for their work. The Congress needs to take a deeper look at this mturk system, which conceals these types of business practices behind the shield of a contract worker arrangement provided by the shrink wrapped, boilerplate adhesion language in their TOS. Legislature and the courts need to further assess the whole system to gauge its compliance with basic levels of public policy, acceptable in the reasonable standards expected in an industrialized nation. If such systemic false pretense routinely engaged in by those requesters who make use of the mturk system to actively pursue the above-mentioned practices does not enumerate as the key elements of material fraud, then how else is it reasonably described? There is no rating system of the requesters provided by Amazon. Mturk workers are in the dark when accepting a work hit that could result in non payment by one of these unscrupulous requesters meeting the above definitions. In the interim, a plug-in such as the one provided by Turkopticon can provide some minimal measure, though incomplete because of its 3rd party implementation, forewarning to the mturk worker pool.",1,mturk.com
7508,"It isn't a scam but it doesn't make much money. According to Forbes ""estimates of what workers can earn on these crowdsourced tasks range from about $1.20 to $5 an hour without any benefits. Employers treat them as independent contractors not covered by federal minimum-wage legislation"".",1,mturk.com
7509,"What a joke I could not use amazon turk because of the stupid amazon payments why? Because for some reason they disabled my account because they could not confirm my information, but would they tell me what info no. How can I fix this they said you cant. end of story. Well what a waste of time now my bank info and ssn are stuck on that site and because it is disabled I cannot even delete them! Customer service was a joke dont even bother calling",1,mturk.com

We regret to inform you that you will not be permitted to work on Mechanical Turk. Our account review criteria are proprietary and we cannot disclose the reason why an invitation to complete registration has been denied.

Sincerely, Amazon Mechanical Turk https://www.mturk.com 410 Terry Avenue North SEATTLE, WA 98109-5210 USA What the hell about a review process is proprietary? Are you kidding? What was proprietary about it? It is because they only hire Americans now. Because of this review, a friend here in Canada who uses MTURK has cancelled her jobs so now she will use clickwork.com",1,mturk.com
7511,mturk sucks they closed your account without warning and when you send email and ask why they close the account they do not reply I send servral email and it has been over a month and no reply because they sucks and don't want to pay for work done and have no care for the employee.,1,mturk.com
7512,"Many of the hits do not work at all and you get negative profiles for being unable to complete things that don't work, even if you return them.",1,mturk.com
7513,Too many account info requirements! They need your driver license number and your SSN#. I would use something simpler.,1,mturk.com
7514,"I originally reviewed Amazon Mechanical Turk as a good place to work for a little extra spending money, and I still stand by that review. However, from a customer service aspect it is horrible.  Be careful of the HITS you accept. If you are doing HITS for a new requester. Do only a few HITS first and wait and see if they reject or accept and how long they take to do that and pay you. You could waste hours and have many HITS rejected (without knowing why) which will bring down your rating and could cause AMAZON to freeze or block your account. Amazon also randomly suspends accounts because you will be treated as an algorithm and not a human.  Be careful about keeping money sitting in your account without moving it quickly. You could get suspended for unknown reasons and lose your earnings. This happens quit frequently. Suspensions happen for real reasons to protect the site but also for reasons unknown with no fault of yours.  Reaching customer service and resolving these problems tend to be futile and you will likely be given a canned response email. It still can be good place to make extra money, just be aware of what could happen and protect yourself first.",2,mturk.com
7515,"Now mturk become worst, all requesters left mturk because increase in commission from 10% to 40%. In 2013-2016 boom in work, daily 10 to 20 projects to work, but now 1 project in couple days. I don't know who is head of mturk, he is worst person.",2,mturk.com
7516,"It's ok. I've been working on mturk for a long time now and I can tell you it isn't what it used to be. Now that they changed over to the new worker site it is even worse! I do the best I can on it with scripts to catch but, there isn't much work anymore. Mturk just isn't worth it these days.",3,mturk.com
7517,Here is my honest review of Amazon Mechanical Turk. I have been a worker for several years so this is a good resource to check. http://spiralnotes.com/mechanical-turk-review/,3,mturk.com
7518,We create a new account last month in mturk but we get declined mail. it possible to accept in future.,3,mturk.com
7519,"Mechanical Turk was originally a way for people all over the world, and in poor countries in particular, to make small amounts of money easily. By 2011, there were workers in 190 countries. Because a mastery of English is necessary, at some point Amazon started taking only American applications. (If anyone knows when the change was made, let us know in your review.)  Because workers are independent contractors, i.e. self-employed, the US minimum wage law doesn't apply. So there's no Turk in Third World countries, where a few dollars can be meaningful income, while Americans create all sorts of ways to be successful at working for pennies. That's the irony.",3,mturk.com
7520,"I've been doing this since February, and I've made a little over $1000 now. Yes, it's low paying and not a quick get-rich type of thing at all. But it pays for my food, gas, and pocket money every week, letting me save more money from my regular full time job. Mind you, I'm the type of person who gets excited to find pennies, dimes, and nickels on the sidewalks, so this works for me. I don't put a lot of effort into it, since it's only pocket change for me. I do it while I'm at work, and sometimes at night. Some people get real crazy, setting alarms to snatch up good-paying HITs in the middle of the night from international requestors, working on them for 8 hours a day, etc. I do it mostly as a hobby, and don't get too crazy. If I'm working on a HIT and I don't feel it's worth it, I just return it and do another one. You will start to know which ones are worth your time, and which ones you enjoy doing the best. I did try and do this for 5+ hours a day once, and it drove me crazy. I could never do this as a full time job, because I wouldn't have what it takes. You have to really pay attention to everything you do, read every single word, and submit everything in the correct way, or you might not be paid. The highest paid HIT I've done was $6 for about 40 minutes. There are some fun HITs on here every now and then, too. Even the smaller $.05 or $.10 cent HITs sometimes are a gem, because they include bigger bonuses in them. I choose to have the money direct deposited into my bank, and it takes less than 24 hours to hit my bank account. You are a contractor for them, so yes, you will have to pay taxes on your income when the time comes. Keep that in mind.",4,mturk.com
7521,"Mturk isnt anything that you'd want to quit your day job over, but it is nicefor a few extra bucks or Amazon gift cards now and again. I've used it for a long time and will do so for many more years as long as it is around",4,mturk.com
7522,I work on Amazon Mechanical Turk and there are many dollar amounts to be made. It is great for small amounts at a time . The money can go directly to your bank or Amazon account. 2 Draw backs I can see is the time it takes to get paid from some hits you do and being able to get paid through Pay Pal. That would be good if they did that.,4,mturk.com
7523,I haven't come across any problems with it. I came across mturk from a friend who uses it. I admit i was a bit skeptical at first when mturk needed my SS information (but that's only for verification so you can receive payment once you cash out) and I love it. The hits are easy and approved quite quickly. I will continue to use mturk. Love it.,4,mturk.com
7524,"MTurk is a great place for people looking to make a few extra bucks in their free time, however, there are a small group of people who actually make a living there. Better paying hits open up as you rack up bigger and better numbers. Be careful to keep your acceptance rate over 90% if you want the best hits. The Turkopticon add-on is a must to weed out the bad requesters. Pay is daily if you have $1 to claim, and you can easily transfer your earnings to your bank account. The site is very secure. I've never had a problem with losing any money. All-in-all, a good site, but not without its flaws, which is why I give it a 4. Most people give up too easily, and are not willing to learn the system or work hard enough to make it work for them. With diligence and accuracy, you can make a good amount of money there at night while you're watching t.v.",4,mturk.com
7525,I love amazon mechanical Turk on my free time In the last month I made over $100 and the task are very easy to complete you can watch tv and complete tasks at the same time,4,mturk.com
7526,"I would really like to give this site five stars. Essentially ""Mechanical Turk Requesters"" ask mturk.com to accomplish a set of tasks, tasks that ""Mechanical Turk Workers"" then accomplish. Requesters and Workers need never actually contact each other. I think automating the relationship of people who need to get tasks done and people who want to accomplish these tasks for some kind of incentive in the fashion that ""Amazon's Mechanical Turk"" does this is awesome and could most likely be the future of a large portion of labor. It disheartens me, however, that a lot of this work is antithetical to the hacker ethic in specific and putting human potential to its highest, best use in that it can not only be quite a bit tedious at times but also not compensate very well for the amount of work involved. Compounding this, instructions with some Requesters can be very vague and as you get no instantaneous feedback on your work, this can damage your ratings, restricting you from being able to take on more choice tasks, if you do a lot of tasks in a row incorrectly. Also, I am too often left only hoping that the goals of the tasks I take on are in agreement with my own values.",4,mturk.com
7527,"I have been using this site for about 8 months now. As the previous reviewer said, the HITs pay from $.01 to $20.00 and up. Generally, the harder the task, the more money you will be paid (obviously) and the more qualified you have to be. For the HIT's that require qualification, you need to take the given test and pass it to be able to qualify. Basically, the more time you spend on here the more money you will make. One can make a good amount of money on here. Certainly not a sole income but definitely some spending money or some money to put away in savings or something. I've been paid for taking quizzes, surveys, transcribing audio, editing written assignments, and some other odd jobs. It can be fun too!",4,mturk.com
7528,I've been a turker since 2016 and have made money to add to my Amazon gift card balance or to transfer to my bank. It doesn't pay much but the work isn't difficult. You do have to pay attention as you may not receive payment if you don't follow directions carefully. Happy Turking!,5,mturk.com
7529,I tried to contact the company through their toll free number and customer service support was excellent. They asked me a few clarifications regarding my account details twice which I answered after which they permitted me to work from the next day.,5,mturk.com
7530,"Although the tasks range from a mere $0.50 to $2.00, the amount can build up, and is definitely worth it if you want to save on Amazon.com purchases or simply transfer to your bank account.",5,mturk.com
7531,"I am proud of being an amazon turker. The tasks are Quite simple and interesting. HITS include identifying objects in a photo or video, performing data de-duplication, transcribing audio recordings, or researching data details etc. I've been working on Mturk since 2010. Any one with knowledge in english can work on it. Now I am a trusted worker with 98.4% accuracy and worked on more than 42000 Hits. I recommend this to all those who wish to earn some money by doing transcriptions, surveys, playing interactive games (as part of survey).",5,mturk.com
7532,"For starters, you only need to accumulate 1 dollar in your account to cash out and you should always quickly receive your payout as a direct deposit in your bank account. Mturk offers many tasks, or HITs that you can qualify for and complete relatively quickly. Many of the tasks pay well and almost all of the requesters for the tasks are honest and will pay you for your task completion.  However, the fraud rate seems to be creeping up; whereas the rate for not getting conned out of getting paid for completing surveys was close to 100 %, the rate has gone down to about 90 % for me. Although it's unfortunate for this to ever happen, I find Mturk to probably be the best money-paying site for survey takers and task participants dollar for dollar.",5,mturk.com

People upload simple tasks others can do, for example, you can complete mini surveys, or write articles, and transcribe audio (listening an audio and writing it out into words). HITs vary from $.01-$20 & up. I've been doing HITs averaging from 4-5 bucks, and made around $130 in two weeks, which is not bad at all. This site is pretty much secure...you have the option of transfering your money into Amazon credits, or into your bank account through the Amazon website.",5,mturk.com
