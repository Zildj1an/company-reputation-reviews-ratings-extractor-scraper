0,"If you ever have a problem rest assured, customer service is very sorry and understands, but there is nothing they can do. Remember this because you'll hear it before EVERY sentence they say. Most recently a brand new fire stick broke within a month. We were sent a refurbished one to replace it! The rep did not understand what my problem was despite his constant insisting he did understand, and was very sorry, but there was nothing he could do. Beyond all of this you now have to worry about fake reviews and counterfeit items. I think it's time we realized Amazon is an evil company. You guys make Walmart seem like a wholesome company!",1,“Worst customer service in the biz” 
1,"So I have been using amazon for the past two years and I have never left a review as I just couldn't be bothered. For once, I wrote a review as I actually liked the product but then later receiving a message on amazon saying that I won't be able to post any more reviews as I was violating against the policies. I called them a few times later receiving an e mail saying that I ever the had a relationship with some seller, or I was getting free or discounted stuff and that's the reason I was posting a good review and also my account had been banned from writing a reiview ever since. What really pisses me off is that there is  always a botton there where you can choose to leave a review but when I do, I get a ban. After called them 10 times and speaking to 5 different managers, about a month after the issue. What I got told on the phone was basically, we will not provide you with anymore information, we will not prove anything to you and the decision is final, happy or not, deal with with it' how bad does it sound? All I asked was, if they are determined' I was violating against their 3 policies like I have said above, prove it to me that I actually know the seller or I was getting free stuff? But no, I don't get any and I have to deal with it. The very last manager that I spoke to had a terrible attitude and they don't treat you like customers.",1,“Worst customer service ever!”

3,I've paid for prime for a few months now and my last 3 orders that were guaranteed in 2 days were not here in 2 days. 2 were a day late and one was 2 days late. I contacted them to complain and they did nothing. I paid for prime for the 2 day delivery and they can't meet the deadline. I cancelled my membership and won't be using it again.,1,“Prime sucks” 
4,"I ordered a Nintendo switch and a few accessories for it. My fiance and I are huge gamers and and have been wanting to get one for a while. Now for clarifications I'm going to mention that over a year ago we had a nasty problem with package theft in my area, the police reports were filed and everything so now I have all of my packages set to be picked up from a carrier facility . Back to the reviews, my package arrived at the UPS pick up location on time, unfortunately it was missing an item I had ordered. No big deal right? I'll just contact customer service let them know it wasn't included in my package and we can sort this out right? Nope! I contacted CS and they asked me to wait a few days so they could investigate and that maybe it had just been misshipped alright cool no problem. The next day I get and email stating that I've had a high number of ""missing/stolen orders"" returns and that I should review the return policy. I'm obviously confused cause as I had said its been well over a year since the only incident I've ever had with stolen packages. I contact CS again and they tell me I need to file a police report before they can go any further and provide them with information about the report....??? By this point I've explained to them several times that I had the item set for pick up from a carrier location so it wasn't stolen it just wasn't sent. I'm normally not the type of person who says they're gonna cut ties with a company but Amazon has gone out of their way to place blame on the carrier and myself for this incident and it really shows what kind of company they really are.",1,“Demanded I file a police report for items they said must be stolen when they just didn't ship them” 
5,"I have been using Amazon religiously for years, and have always loved the convenience of the fast and reliable shipping. However, over the last months, I have encountered FOUR shipping issues, either stating that my product was somehow damaged and sent back and that I should order a new one myself, lost and I should order a new one, or not delivered because ""they did not want to leave a package unattended"" even though they always leave my packages by the door for the last 4-5 years AND had left a package from a different order DURING THE SAME DELIVERY. Now they are just returning the item to the seller without even telling me, after they told me they would deliver as soon as possible. Prior to the last month, I had never encountered any problems with Amazon, and now all these problems are occurring and I am wary when placing an order, almost anticipating some kind of error. Amazon used to be reliable, and now all that has gone down in the dumps. Will be canceling my Prime Membership, and will NOT be using this company anymore.",1,“Amazon shipping has gone in the dumps” 
6,"Realized we've been being charged by Amazon for a ""sellers"" account that we do not control and is not associated with any of the emails we own. Secondly Amazon is charging a credit card we rarely use when buying from them. Amazon will not give us information because our emails are not associated with the sellers account, yet they keep charging our card (14 times to the tune of $559.96). They finally agreed to deactivate the card, but will not take responsibility for the money. (The credit card company is taking responsibility for some, but not all of it.) Gone over the statements carefully & these are the ONLY charges that do not fit. The problem seems to be with Amazon & only Amazon, yet they do not assume responsibility. Advise that you do not leave your personal information (billing/ship to addresses, credit card info, etc) on Amazon and cut WAY back on your Amazon purchases!",1,“Beware of Your Info on Amazon” 
7,"At 7pm, my latest order prompted a message, """"We tried to deliver your package.
Unfortunately we couldn't enter your building but we will try again. If your address requires an access code, please provide it below."" The delivery was being sent to an AMAZON LOCKER that is supposedly accessible 24/7. There was NO EXCUSE for failing delivery. I have previously had packages go missing, so I figured it would be safe to try an amazon locker. Since the failed delivery, I have read some disturbing info about lockers being unable to be opened. I'm starting to feel like this is personal. As their ""good faith gesture"", they offered me a $5.00 coupon toward my next QUALIFYING SOLD BY/SHIPPED BY Amazon order. Yep. Give them $20. more and they'll make up for their latest abominable mistake. I'm going to film opening the locker, because I'm expecting it to be EMPTY. Extremely great incentive to BUY LOCAL.",1,“Fail delivering to Amazon Lockers” 
8,"I have been a loyal Amazon customer for many years. On January 19, 2019 I ordered an accessory for my smartphone on the Amazon website. It later turned out that this item was sold on the Amazon Marketplace by a Chinese vendor who shipped it by China Post. Since January 23 the shipment has been sitting at a Chinese postal sorting facility in Shenzhen City, without moving anywhere. In response to my complaint Shana W. of Amazon's Executive Customer Relations wrote me that there was nothing they could do and that they would not answer any further message on this matter. Her message was full of gibberish like ""You won&rsquo;t be able to submit a claim."" It is now February 1 and there is no sight of the order anywhere. Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos has ignored my personal message.as well.",1,“Amazon's poor service” 
9,I was billed yesterday for the subscription of Amazon Prime service which I did never choose or authorized. They used my credit card data stored from my last transaction at Dec 12. It is a fraud. I thought Amazon.com was a safe place to store my credit card data but unfortunately it is not true. I will think twice before buy anything there again,1,“They used my credit card data without authorization” 
10,"I place an order for a book on Amazon and the delivery options if i selected a trial of Prime would result in a delivery on a specified day (2 days) from order date.   I then subscribed, placed the order, received an email confirmation with the delivery date clearly printed on the email.  I also received numerous other solicitations to try other services now that i was a prime member.  ON the day the item was to be delivered i receive an email saying the order would be delivered tomorrow, a day later than promised!   I needed that product for work that day, and now it will not be here on time.  AMAZON boasts about the benefits of prime, and has no problem overcharging us for something they cannot deliver on time anyway! Next time, i will go to the big box store and pick up the item the same day!  I feel AMAZON is a conglomerate that is gobbling up all the small retailers so they can manage the world!  IF i could give them a -000 rating i would.  DON't get caught up in this conglomerate hype, please support local retailers so they can stay around.  Amazon someday will get its just reward,",1,“Promised  delivery date with prime subscription - CRAP!!!!!” 
11,"Same thing keeps happening. Dealing with customer services then Seller Support jumps in. I can't reply as that requires a seller account which I don't currently have or want. So I tell customer services that. Yet told them 6 times today and said seller support NOT to contact me ever again as this is trolling and the employee ought to be disciplined. Of course the messages keep coming with NOTHING from customer services. Seriously thinking of legal action for harassment. Thoughts?

It is also beginning to put my favorite stores out of business. I would give anything to have amazon not exist anymore",1,“Taking over” 
13,"I purchased an incorrect item back in Nov 2018. Upon opening the package, I realized my mistake. I immediately applied for a refund, got my refund code, prepared the package to be sent back, and paid for the shipping back to the seller.

I contacted Amazon in mid-December after I realized the package had been delivered but my refund had not been received. They told me it could take some time and that they would take care of everything. I left it at that.

I had not received anything nor heard from Amazon into early January, so I contacted them again. I got the same response but they were escalating it to their complaints department. Great?!?! now I had to wait for them to get back to me again.

I had not received any communication since contacting Amazon earlier in the month. I was getting annoyed. I contacted them for the third time and I got the exact same run around that I was given earlier. I was given three days to hear back from Amazon to see if I can even get my refund.

It went from a simple return to the potential I won't even get it. Leaving the seller with both my money and the product. 

Every agent I spoke to had no information and no power. They couldn't do anything. Useless and a waste of time.

I have since deleted all my accounts",1,“Amazon doesnt care” 
14,"once again Amazon screws me and tells me that I have to correct everything. Ordered a camera to be delivered to an amazon pick-up box. Day of delivery, box is too big for amazon pick-up box, and apparently this is my fault not amazons, who sold the item, offered pick-up box as an option, and then refused delivery of item. Called the oh so not friendly amazon customer service just to be told the only thing they can do to transfer me to UPS so I can deal with it. Are you F'in kidding me. You screwed it up not me. It is your responsible to correct the issue, not me! requested to cancel order, customer service didn't cancel order. Called again the next day, basically the same thing. my fault, and I have to go and reorder etc. THIS IS NOT HOW BUSINESS FUNCTIONS. YOUR MISTAKE YOUR SOLUTION. I use to order a lot from amazon however their logical and customer service teams are terrible and have no empathy or basic customer service skill to correct their OWN MISTAKES.

With Amazon whenever you tell the truth this is what you get.

31,"I have been a huge Amazon fan for years... Prime member for years.... almost all on-line shopping dine through Amazon. I have relied heavily on their customer reviews because I felt that they were an HONEST evaluation of a given product. I discovered this week that their reviews are a LIE. They CENSOR and BLOCK negative reviews of verified purchases. This is OUTRAGEOUS. I am shocked and dismayed and wish there was some way I could tell the public at large that AMAZON REVIEWS ARE A SCAM. They will block negative reviews so that people will continue to waste their money on junk products. 

Here is the story and the proof. 

I purchased a stupid Christmas beanie cap on one of their Black Friday lightning deals. It was only like $6 or $7.  The fabric has Christmas lights around it and they supposedly lit up. I thought my high school daughter would get a kick out of it. Despite being Prime, it took like a week to arrive (their ""2 day guaranteed free shipping is another scam which has frustrated me, but not like this... not enough to make me quit the convenience of Amazon). It shows up yesterday and I pull it out of the package and discover that - not only does it NOT light up, it has zero wires and no battery pack. There is a small pocket sewn in the inside where the battery and switch are supposed to be, but again, there are no wires and no battery. It was cheap and I didn't really care enough to return it, but I went onto website to leave a review. (I will generally leave reviews on products that are either 5-star fantastic, or 1-star terrible. I think those experiences are most valuable to other shoppers.) I went into my account and started my review by clicking the one-star button. This should have allowed my to then title and explain my poor review. Instead, I git a message saying that Amazon could not accept my review if this product (mind you, all I had done was click the one star button.) They said that they had some unusual review activity' so they were blocking reviews of this product. I went back into the product image and lo and behold, I see the questions and comments part, I discover that multiple customers received hats just like me. No wires. No battery. And they were also very upset that Amazon was not allowing them to review it. So I sent Customer Service an email expressing my dismay at them blocking honest reviews of products by verified customers on their website. It took a full day (not the 12 hours promised) to reply, but this was the response:

Comments:This ""light up"" hat came with zero wires and no battery pack. Looking at the customer questions/answers, this has happened to a lot of people who ordered this as one of your Black Friday deals. I went to leave a review and it says that Amazon cannot accept my review of this product. What?!!! You are deciding that customers cannot review a product if something you are selling is total garbage? It is not worth my time nor energy to return it but I wanted to be able to at least warn other customers about this product. I have always relied heavily on customer reviews and is why I have always been a fan of Amazon despite numerous frustrations with shipping expectations that you set but rarely meet. Now I know that your reviews are a fraud. You shut down reviews of products that do not even meet basic standards. This company should NOT be allowed to sell through Amazon AND you should allow every verified customer to review any and all products that they have purchased. Shame on you. I will likely quit Amaxon because of this and will post on a review website that you are sensoring and blocking negative reviews.
---------------

The bottom line is this: Amazon is a DISHONEST COMPANY who is censoring customers reviews to protect their bottom line. They want everyone to waste their money on this stupid garbage hat because it makes them money. They want us to believe that the reviews we read are real and are from verified' customers, but they don't tell you that it ya all a lie because they pick and choose which reviews to accept. It is really a disgrace. They were the first company to publish customer reviews in 1995 and now they have lost their way. SHAME on Amazon. I will miss the convenience of shipping with them but I cannot support such a loathsome, dishonest company any longer. I hope all who read this will boycott Amazon as well.",1,“They BLOCK negative reviews!! BEWARE!!” 
32,"I was Amazon prime member from 2014, in last year and half they started doing things like: I order something and they keep delaying delivery for a days, when you order something they guarantee delivery by specific date, after they take your money they start explaining you that you didn't understand and is not always like that. They don't wait no even one day for me to pay, they cut membership in second and they take money in second, but, when you have problems, they keep explaining that you are wrong and they are right. I am switching to eBay. Don't trust Amazon  anymore .",1,“Amazon Prime Membership” 
33,"My Amazon searches are now all gunked up with sponsored adds that appear out of price order and in violation of my criteria!  I've even ordered the wrong thing assuming it was the same as all the other cables on the list.  Walmart has greatly improved, has many of the same small sellers I got in my amazon results, and now has an area in the store near us dedicated to online returns (pick up too but I'd rather have it shipped free to me).  And you can return stuff w/o a reason and still for free.",1,“Go try Walmart!   Its searches contain just the stuff you specified and you can return big things.”

35,"They banned my account for reasons which I did not understand, as an amazon seller, while I have $10,000 on products and inventory just sitting here. They won't explain further or return my emails. No number to call. Don't get into the business unless you want to get burned by amazon.",1,“Don't be sell products on amazon” 
36,I was trying to order Christmas dresses but the company's shipping them gave a after Christmas delivery date which is not right if your ordering Christmas stuff you won't it before Christmas not after I contacted customer service and they said their is nothing they can do this company is a joke I always have problems trying to order,1,“Amazon is the Worst company ever” 
37,"Amazon has their own ""delivery drivers"" now.  The ONLY thing they deliver is NOTHING!  I live in a small apartment complex that is mostly elderly people who order their meds and supplies online.  Most of them never see their orders come in, as most of them use Amazon.

According to the apartment manager, Amazon drivers will drive through the complex, but never stop.  The few that do stop, NEVER bother to try and deliver to the address on the package, they try to dump it off on the manager.  She tells them they cannot leave packages there as she isn't a postal center.  These drivers get pissy and nasty because she forces them to deliver these packages to the actual addresses on the packages!  She says most all of them will just get back in their trucks and leave, and won't even TRY to deliver to the address on the package.

The manager came to work one day and said the maintenance man found a pile of Amazon packages dumped behind one of the bushes outside the building!!!  The douchebag Amazon driver just dumped stuff in the bushes and left!!!!  

DON'T ORDER ANYTHING FROM AMAZON!!!!  Their ""drivers"" won't even attempt to deliver it to your door, and will end up dumping it in some bushes to get rid of it.  They've even been seen dumping packages in local garbage cans!!!

Their customer service I call  are telling me that the items is in a local warehouse but she doesn't know why is taking that long. She can't give me no answer or solution . This is BAD business and I am hoping that more customers catch onto what Amazon is doing. This is repulsive for a multi billion dollar company to switch up their shipping model and blatantly lie to customers. Not happy I'm paying for service I'm not getting it.",1,“They don't ca”

Recently, all of my Prime orders have been changed to 7 day delivery and when I question it, the service response is 'That is how it is'.  No explanation for the change.  No investigation as to why.  Very sad.  I'll be switching to other delivery services and shopping locally.",1,“Gone Downhill on shipping and service” 
40,"I have been an amazon member since 2002, as of today I am no longer a member.  Over the last 2 years I have been hacked 4 times with fradulant charges.  When I do order something from Amazon, I get the typical, confirmation of order, order shipped and order delivered.  This last time I recieved nothing and only found the charges when reviewing my credit card statement. 
I called and was told it would need to be reviewed as one of the charges was gifts cards that were already redeemed.
The security on their website is shameful and even though the charges so far have been minimal I am tired of the one that is always has to do the work for their incompetent ability to have better security measures in place.",1,“HACKED TOO MANY TIMES” 
41,"For months I've been trying to solve a billing dispute with Amazon and Chase (who does Amazon's billing).  Last April Amazon offered a free month's trial of Amazon Prime shipping and I agreed to give it a try.  During that month I realized that I don't order from Amazon enough to justify paying them $14.00 a month so I called them to cancel my membership.  I also brought up the fact that they were charging me $7.99 a month for ""Amazon Digital Services"" (whatever the heck that is) and I certainly didn't order it.  I was assured that they'd cancel my subscriptions and credit my account.  They finally canceled the charges on my September statement but they added them back in the same statement!  They had been charging me the $21.99 per month for five months and it ended up they didn't actually credit my account for even one!
Every single time I've called, I've received the run around.  Amazon's Customer Service Reps (five of them!) tell me I have to call Chase and Chase tells me I have to contact Amazon!  An Amazon CSR sent me an email stating that I owe them nothing but Chase refused to give me their fax number or an email address that I could forward the email to.  After an Amazon Rep pulled a ""we can't call Chase for you"" runaround yet again I replied that Chase has refused several times when I suggested they set up a conference call between them, me and Amazon, he stated that they weren't allowed to make conference calls either. I pointed out that (1) Amazon is the one who notifies Chase how much to bill me for and (2) he knows as well as I do that Chase is not going to take a customer's word for anything...it had to come from Amazon.  I argued him down so he staged the conference call.  When we got a Chase CSR by the name of Rajesh (ID # L348143) on the line, he asked me to verify my identity.  He asked me my email address and I gave it to him.  He said my answer was incorrect so, even though I doubted that since I gave him the one they send their emails to, I held back my anger and gave him my old email address.  He again told me it was incorrect so he couldn't help me.  While he was talking I signed  into my Chase account, went to my profile page and sure enough, I gave him the correct address the first time.  When I informed him that I was starring at my profile page and I had given him the correct email address, he denied it.  When I asked  the Amazon CSR (who had been silent throughout the exchange) to verify my identity, the Chase Rep realized  he was a party to a conference call and he hung up on me.
That's how ridiculous this whole mess has gotten.  I called Amazon one last time this morning and spoke with Shahrukh (ID # I370786) and explained that my cancer meds cause memory loss and confusion and that's why I simply glanced at their statements and paid them whatever they said I owed.  But it finally hit me that the last things I ordered were a microwave in February, 2018 and 2 very cheap software discs in March and since I'd paid them $40 to $60 every month, they had to be paid off by then.  His solution was to credit my account for the two late charges that have been levied while I've been trying to settle the dispute. I told him that wasn't good enough because I'm not paying them another cent...in fact, they OWE ME $50.97.
I'm going to report both companies to the FTC and the BBB and when it's settled, I will cancel my Amazon account and, believe me, I will tell everyone I know or meet about this experience.",1,"“Is it fraud, stupidity or incompetence?” "
42,"When I search items on Amazon USA I see ""This item ships to Quakers Hill, Australia.""

I tried the Amazon Australia. It is very very expansive. Amazon US has got good prices but you don't ship to Australia. JUST BLOCK SITE FOR any Australian come to look here.!

43,"Hello,
Wanted to bring something to light that just happened to me when purchasing a high dollar scope from Amazon.com. I just purchased a Steiner T5Xi from Amazon the seller, not a 3rd party seller (want to be sure that is clear that this came direct from Amazon as the merchant) and when I received the package today I received a shrink wrapped sealed T5Xi box with a Steiner seals on both sides of the box underneath the shrink-wrap. However, all I actually received in the original box were 2 freakin Ice Mountain water bottles inside! I almost got sick. 

Someone tried very hard to defraud either Amazon if it came from Steiner this way or an Amazon employee stealing and knowingly sending the package out this way. It had the LPN label on the outside of the box which usually indicates a previous customer return at some point which means, they were trying to pass it off as ""New.""

What strikes me as very odd was that the manufacture stickers were still sealing the box inside the shrinkwrap. I cut them both myself. That, and the fact that whoever did this knew the weight of the scope to get almost exactly the same weight with the 2 water bottles. 

I'm just in complete shock and awe. I've had someone try to rip me off before on eBay trying to say I sent them junk in a box. Thankfully, I record every package I send prior to shipping so I have the process on file for just these instances but the fact that it came from a billion dollar retailer sealed in this manner just baffles me. 

I can attach some pictures of the box and seals and contents of the package. 

This is the 2nd purchase of a scope in 1 week that was received as the wrong item. I also ordered a 3-12x44mm scope, again from Amazon the merchant, not a 3rd party merchant, and what I received was the same model but the 4-18x44mm version INSIDE the 3-12x44mm box. So obviously, they are selling used or returned items as ""New"" and their now $15 p/h employees are not even checking the boxes to verify the contents.

I am done purchasing anything from Amazon, period. They are clearly falsely marking items as ""New"" that are previously used or returned items and the folks in charge of checking these things to ensure that they are returned correctly and properly retested are failing miserably. 

Thanks for your attention,

55,"My hobby is building AK-47s.  They are immaculate but sometimes when looking for parts I try and find a reasonable bargain. I usually add scopes to them and almost always buy from a military supplier in Belarus...a small country just west of Russia. I sometimes find good scopes on Ebay but I never knew that Amazon sold the Belarus scopes until recently.  Amazon had a model scope I like and usually buy but I had never bought one from Amazon. These were cheaper than normal but since the wording was incorrect and some of the specifications displayed incorrectly I at first thought that who ever listed the article just was ill-informed and perhaps mismatched the prices. After all there were some of the correct scopes with the normal prices listed next to the scope I was interested in. Over the next hour I looked closely and the item had the Belarus markings in Ukrainian. The title had Russian terms. The scope was exactly the same as the ones shown on the Belarus site in every detail. I thought to myself that surely Amazon would not allow imitations and knock-offs to be sold on their site? So I bought the scope. The next morning I got an ""Your item has shipped"" with a Chinese post tracking number. The delivery date spanned two weeks which was a good indicator it was coming from China. I found out that  indeed the scope I bought was a Chinese imitation. I tried to write a review of my experience but Amazon rejected it saying I could not say it was an imitation and of poor quality. The next morning I noticed the price went up $40. I noticed these scopes were intermingled among authentic scopes but there is no indicator that these scopes are mailed from China which would be the one key warning that all was not right.

Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill.

The stroller was shipped out on THURSDAY and it's not here! I now have to go to the baby shower empty handed because Amazon took over TWO WEEKS to ship out the stroller! I have NEVER had service like this with amazon ever. Amazon used to be so great with their prompt service (I do not have prime) if I ordered something two weeks prior. Amazon also screwed up and sent me my items (of the same order) in a plain brown box without the amazon logo box that products always arrive in and I was missing two items! When I called amazon AGAIN I'm getting one of the items shipped to me at no extra charge, and the other item they wanted returned. How am I supposed to return something I never got? When I spoke to customer service, the woman I spoke with wasn't very apologetic, she was rather rude and tried to give me an amazon gift card so I could repurchase the item. I said no and to put it back on my credit card. That I would not be purchasing from amazon again. All I've had was headaches the past two weeks in dealing with them. I could have gone to Target, and paid the SAME price ($400) for the stroller and had it already and would have been prepared for my baby shower that I need to go today. Thank you amazon for ruining my gift for the baby shower. I should get the $7 dollar refund that the stroller is now up for ""sale"" with for my troubles. After speaking with amazon about my troubles they REFUSED to give me the $7 back for my troubles and ended up giving me line after line of bull$#*! of why they couldn't give me a credit of $7. 
They also deleted my review of the ""stroller"" (which was titled appropriately ""this is a review of amazon not the stroller"") because it did not meet their ""guidelines"", it doesn't meet their guidelines because I was speaking badly about amazon and god forbid they have any negative comments floating around, my god they might lose business. 
And guess what? THEY ARE!

68,"Amazon customer service representatives lies.  I had 2 orders from them and they lied about shipping.  The first order was a birthday gift, the customer service said they have notified UPS to deliver it by the birthday date.  It did not happen, and the package was delivered 3 days after the birthday.

My most recent purchase was a mobile phone worth $1000.  I scheduled the delivery one week after because no one will be home to receive it.  I was surprised that they changed it to 2 day shipping.  So, I called UPS and UPS told me to talk to Amazon to change the date.  I chat with Amazon 3x and all 3 representatives assured me that it will arrive on my expected date and not the date that I was seeing on the tracking.  Representatives said that UPS will not leave it outside if no one is at home and that they already notified UPS.  When I saw the tracking saying out for delivery, I immediately contacted Amazon for a 4th time.  Representative told me again not to worry, that UPS just put it in the truck but it won't be delivered and that UPS will not leave it outside.  Guess what?!  UPS left it outside the house.  Amazon will say ANYTHING to assure a customer, but I doubt they even talked to UPS on the phone to make sure it really will be delivered on the date I wanted.  

So, I chat with Amazon 2 more times after that and told them to send UPS back to pick the package for return to Amazon and issue me a full refund.  Amazon rep is stupid to ask if I can send someone to check if the package is still there. If I had someone to check it, then I would ask that person to take it until i can get it.  Amazon rep are so stupid.  Anyway, I told them it is exactly wherever the UPS put it because no one is at home.  They gave a tracking number.  As of right now. no one has picked it up.

This makes no sense unless the real purpose of being an Amazon member is to open all of your transactions to government phishers. All the personal 'verification' needed was to PING the card in amount of $1.00 to confirm its validity otherwise the card would be rejected outright. What Amazon is really saying here is that we don't trust you to be who you claim to be without outside confirmation. That's not membership, it's just abuse.

Apparently Amazon no longer limits abuse to its employees but is now including customers as Salon reports: Worse than Wal-Mart: Amazon's sick brutality and secret history of ruthlessly intimidating workers. (https://www.salon.com/2014/02/23/worse_than_wal_mart_amazons_sick_brutality_and_secret_history_of_ruthlessly_intimidating_workers/)  ""You might find your Prime membership morally indefensible after reading these stories about worker mistreatment."" Don't be overly shocked, this is simply globalism and its New World Order business practices. It's the future of American business. Oh that's just sour grapes. Really? Well how about Amazon used neo-Nazi' guards to control workers in German factory? 
(https://www.rt.com/news/amazon-abuse-staff-germany-310/) Oh, too harsh, still? How about the Orwellian work environment at Amazon as in Forbes' assessment, ""What Amazon's Work Culture Tells Us About Employee Disengagement (https://www.forbes.com/sites/causeintegration/2015/08/21/what-amazons-work-culture-tells-us-about-employee-disengagement/#6316bac454f0)

But what disturbs me most is the Huff Post Blog reporting a $600 million dollar deal Amazon struck with the CIA for cloud services  (https://www.huffingtonpost.com/norman-solomon/why-amazons-collaboration_b_4824854.html) which likely means the CIA has access to all purchases made by Amazon customers. The Blog further reports: "".. a signer in Cincinnati wrote: ""If Amazon chooses to sell out their customers to the CIA, I will never visit their site again. Betrayal shouldn't be the price of convenience."" This certainly goes a long way towards explaining why Amazon would be so interested in confirming' mine and others customer information.

On Jan 17th, I called the company and spoke to a representative who was to look into the problem.' I told them what had happened and the lady I spoke with indicated that I had to respond with the email address that I opened the account with. Well, duh.. I DID that and they acknowledged it by responding to the ORIGINAL email address that I opened the account with!!.

Yes, secure like Yahoo and Facebook which had millions of their 'secure' customer records hacked. And might they also be passing my business information along to the NSA or FBI as BEST Buy technical people are currently doing for the FBI?

The customer rep never addressed my reply or indicated why my bank had to confirm my identity. A few days later I got another email asking why I discontinued my account. Interesting enough, Amazon's Bezos owns the Washington Post and since I have been a written critic of that intellectual rag, the Amazon episode begins to make a bit more sense.

Trump may be on to something in Donald Trump's war on Jeff Bezos, Amazon and the Washington Post Looks like Amazon.com has been getting a pretty cushy tax break in their rise to economic fame. (http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/13/technology/donald-trump-jeff-bezos-amazon/)

And of course, we all know the journalistic integrity' of WAPO as in After the WaPost's Latest Shot, It's Time to Call Fake News' By Its Real Name Weaponized Journalism'  (http://thefreethoughtproject.com/wapost-fake-news-weaponized-journalism/) My observation to the WAPO editor on instructions from Jeff Bezos for their news coverage is that company policy (written or otherwise) dictates news coverage just as it would with any other firm subsidiary. Don't think for a moment that WAPO isn't looking out for the Amazon billionaire's interests.

There is another possibility, the company is advertising the sale of an item they don't have and won't have available unless a sufficient number of people express interest before they order from their China supplier. In that case you might want a verifiable customer base to motivate the Chinese.

After putting $20 of items in my cart( prime items), went to check out....and low and behold there was no $10 credit as advertised in the promotional pop up! I called customer service and after being on the phone for over a half hour and speaking to two different people I had no choice but to cancel my Prime Membership. WHY do I want to be with a company that doesn't stand by their own words!?!
They solicited me with an offer so I'm not really sure what's going through their heads right now...but apparently they need the $10 more than I do, bless  their little heart!

All I can say is if they dont want to honor their promotions maybe they shouldn't solicit people with little pop up windows ....

The funny thing is not only did I cancel my Prime membership (for which they will have to refund me 120...) but I will not be renewing it again in the future!!!

So they lost 120 this year and 100's in future years....

Overall this was more of a blessing in disguise... now I'm free!!!

 I won't have to pay 120 a year for free shipping that I use only a handful of times each year.

80,"I use to highly enjoy Amazon at first then it all became about Prime.  Less and less became accessible to clients unless they upgraded to a Prime account.  I ceased purchasing several items because they became Prime only members.  When I did try Prime I found you needed to make at least 10 purchases a year to make it worth while.  Other wise it's not really worth it.  I found they lie about the shipping dates all the time.  Especially during the holidays.  Starting around early October shipping is unreliable and they can barely keep up with the order volume.  

If an item becomes backordered your purchase sits until it comes in.  No way to cancel it.  This keeps happening to me.  Not one word of notification it was backordered just pending, pending and pending for weeks.  I had to call and ask.  They told me they could not cancel it.

Amazon use to be high quality items that would last a while and reasonably priced.  Now it's a China junk store with all the c*rappy merchandise you could want that's been sold to the cheapest bidder that will break after a few uses.  Amazon is not regulating the items they sell and the quality is just going down hill.

Customer service is also another issue.  Customer service is terrible.  If you get a gift card that does not work it's hell being on the phone for up to an hour or two just trying to get the dumb thing to work.  No point in going to the store you purchased it from because gift card booths are contracted out.  They're just selling the item they do not own it.  

I've also noticed Amazon reviews to be some what fluffed and most if not all are lies.  Every Amazon review I post seems to either be A) edited beyond what I originally wrote and is not even close to what I wrote. Hence plagiarism.  or B) Denied if it's the slightest bit negative that hints the product is defective or bad.

I am a price shopper and go with the highest quality item at the lowest bid.  Amazon over charges their clientele and I wonder just how long I have been over paying for things.  Most retailers on Amazon over charge their items any where from 15-25% all the way up to 50% marked-up compared to your local retailer.

The item was supposed to be here Thursday of last week and FedEx said it was on the truck ready to be delivered, but their driver drove right past and then lied and said nobody was in the apartment office or at home. There were three people in the office waiting for the delivery and one person at home waiting for the delivery. So we called FedEx and ask them if they could please deliver the item as they are contracted to and do their actual job. On Friday of course the same driver drove past we watched him drive past and refuse to stop again he entered into his terminal that nobody was there which is a complete fraudulent lie there were three people in the office and one or two people in the apartment.

Amazon employs used car salesman tactics and time sensative pressure to make you purchase an item. Once they have your money. They laugh all the way to the bank. You will get your item whenever they feel like it. I suggest this. DO NOT pay for useless Sub-Prime membership. Pay for 2 day shipping per item, if supplier offers it and cannot meet requirements, Amazon will refund your shipping cost. So, either you get it on time, or shipping is free. And you dont pay $120 a year for nothing. I also verified the refund thru Amazon, but not if your Sub-Prime.

Like many of the Amazon drop shippers, they post ads for things on different websites. When someone buys something from them, they just turn around and look for something else on the web that's cheaper and have the real seller send it to their buyer. They are actually dropshippers that have been around for a long time. They were banned on Amazon, Amazon closed their account and they had to wait 3 months to set up a new account, which is why they appear to be new sellers. We're not sure, but based on the timing, we believe they may be the old seller ""DailyDeals"", whose scams got them shut down on Amazon. 

Chris's Bargains prices are outrageous, because of course as scammers they are just skimming money off the top. We're shocked people fall for the scam, but Amazon is doing nothing to stop it, since they are raking in fees when every book sells twice.

Just know, That like the rest of the dropshippers, if you buy a book from them or anything else, you are paying a lot more than you need to, and all they are going to do is by a cheaper book from another person that had it posted on Amazon and send it to you.

103,"I Ordered the Sony (used) 900e through Amazon. I was given a guaranteed delivery date. Made arrangements to have someone home that day to sign for the delivery. The TV did not come on the promised day which caused much inconvenience. Finally, the package arrived. I removed the TV from the box, and much to my surprise, the entire screen was cracked. Upon closer examination I found a huge hole in the side of the box. The television had not been properly packed; there was nothing in the box to prevent screen damage. Needless to say, I immediately returned the product. It was a big mistake to purchase this item used!

Later on that evening, I went to Best Buy and purchased a new 990e for $115.00 more. I couldnt believe the extra measures that were taken in the packaging to insure that there would be no damage to the set.

Id also like to mention, that a set of new Dolby Atmos headphone were also ordered at the same time. What I received was a used set of headphones poorly packed with important parts missing.

Since their email did not elaborate what the issue was but merely asked for information on my credit card, I had to make assumptions on the possible problems and responded with the details requested and explanations. 

More than a day later, in response, I get another email from amazon asking me to log in to my account and upload my credit card statement. 

However, since my account was blocked I was not able to log into my account and hence I could not upload the card statement either. I sent amazon a note on my predicament and at the same time thought I might as well speak to their customer service consultant to expedite the matter. After searching their website for more than 20 minutes I could find neither a chat link nor a telephone number to call. I gave up.

115,"In relation to Order # 205-8187368-2071530:

On 18th December I placed an order with Amazon for around £250 worth of items using their Prime 'Guaranteed Next Day' delivery service. The order consisted 11 different items (a range of toys and other gifts bought for Christmas to give to family and friends). Amazon in the past have been a very reliable and reputable company with exemplary customer service so I felt that this was a convenient and safe option to make sure I had everything arrive in time for Christmas. This, however, was the start of my Christmas nightmare.

The following day, nothing arrived. This was not an issue however, as my family were not coming to visit until the following Saturday so there was still another 4 days left before it would present any sort of problem for me. On the Wednesday, 3 of the 11 items turned up. On Thursday, nothing. On Friday morning, I finally receive a phone call from my sister (whose address the parcels were due to arrive at) telling me she was starting to get worried as most of the items had still not arrived and they had to be ready and wrapped for the following day to give to my visiting family members who live in a different part of the country. Given the urgency of the situation, I decided to take a break from work and give Amazon's customer service department a call.

I initially spoke to a member of their team who looked into the situation and found that the items had indeed not been delivered, but that it should be fine and they would most likely arrive later that day. I explained my situation to them and told them that essentially if the items did not turn up I would be stuck with nothing to give to my family to open on Christmas day. I asked this member of staff to look into the situation again so that they could absolutely guarantee this, at which point the line goes quiet and a few seconds later the call terminates. Not being satisfied with the outcome, I decide to call back again at which point I get through to another customer service agent who again appears to hang up the call. By this point I was getting very frustrated but given that I had no choice I decided to call them again.

By this time, it was 3:00pm and I had already wasted around half an hour of my working day trying to sort the situation out. I then get through to customer service agent number 3, who I explain to that I haven't received my items - to which he replies that they will definitely arrive by 9pm that night. I then explain to the agent that I need this absolutely guaranteed as if they do not deliver the items by 9pm I would then not have an opportunity to go out Christmas shopping that day in order to replace the items they had not delivered. After some deliberation he agrees to go and double check for me, and, surprise surprise, he tells me that the parcels won't be arriving after all.

By this point, I was absolutely fuming. I could not believe that after 5 days of waiting on their 'Guaranteed Next Day' delivery and an hour on the phone speaking to 3 different people they were actually telling me they were not able to deliver my parcels. All of this given that they DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE DECENCY to contact me and let me know what was going on. Had my sister not bothered to contact me, I wouldn't have even known until the following day (by which point it would be too late).

Anyway, I continued my conversation with agent number 3 and explained that I was absolutely disgusted by their level of service and that my only option was to finish work early (costing me around £50 in lost pay), travel to the town centre and spend the rest of my afternoon/evening shopping for presents that I didn't have the money for (since I had already spent it with Amazon). The initial response to this was to offer me a £5 Amazon gift card and 1 month free Amazon Prime (frankly an insult given the situation). They then offer me a refund to which I tell the agent it does not compensate me for the situation they have caused and I would be making a complaint and closing down my account (which I have had for over 10 years and spent many thousands of pounds with them on). He then decides to go and speak to his manager, and agrees that they will still fulfill the order and I will receive the items in due course, and they will issue me a full refund (which would instantly arrive in my account) for the items not yet received. Although I was not happy about having to leave work and roam around the town centre buying presents, I felt this was fair compensation and the best they could do given the situation. We then end the call and I head out of work.

I arrive in a very busy town centre and attempt to look for anything which may be suitable given the money I had on my card. I enter Toys R Us and grab some toys for my niece and nephew, head to the counter and get my card out to pay. I enter my PIN and find that my card has been declined. I then try again, but it appears as though there is no money in my account. I then leave Toys R Us (the time is now about 5:00pm) and head to the Cashpoint machine to find that my refund has not yet arrived. I go on Amazon's live chat and the person I speak to tells me that the refund will arrive in 5-7 working days. Desperate, I call one of my friends who agrees to lend me £50 (not exactly enough for 8 gifts but better than nothing). I then spend my evening around town buying anything I can so at least there is something for my family to open for Christmas (aware that the items should arrive later on and I could always try and post them later).

Christmas then comes and goes without too much bother. It comes to my attention in the first week of January however that the items had still not been delivered, so I decide its time to give Amazon another call. I get through to a customer service agent, and after saying a few words the call hangs up, so I call back again. I then get through to another agent who explains to me that my refund has been issued. I tell him that I have received the refund but I was still waiting for the items, for which he says the items had been returned and would not be sent out again. I then explain to them that I was still supposed to receive the items as per the agreement I made with them on the 22nd of December, to which he replies (surprise) that there are no notes on the system to this effect. He agrees to raise the issue with a manager for it to be investigated and I would definitely receive an email back about this in 5-7 days.

2 weeks later, I still have no email or items, so I call Amazon again. After calling them three times and being hung up on and spending around 45 minutes on the phone I am finally put through to a supervisor. They tell me again that there is no notes on the system and there has been no investigation into my case. This time, I am promised a call back the following day at 5:00pm once the investigation has been done. I sit next to my phone at 5:00pm the following day but do not receive a call. I then check my Amazon account to find a message sent saying that they 'weren't able to reach me' and they were sorry that I was 'misinformed' that I would still receive the items. They tell me I should call back again for more information about it.

I can tell you I have now given up trying to deal with their shambolic customer service team. The entire experience has been absolutely disgraceful and they should be ashamed of the way they have treated me as a longstanding and loyal customer of 10 years. I am now going to be closing my account with them and I will be posting my experience on every major review site online as well as telling all my friends and family. Amazon has embarrassed me at a supposed happy time of year and they don't seem to give a monkeys about their customers anymore. I will now be reporting them to the Advertising Standards Agency regarding their false advertising claims and I will be speaking to BBC's Watchdog about my case.

I HAVE FULL EVIDENCE FOR ALL OF THIS BUT IF ANYONE ELSE HAS HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE PLEASE LET ME KNOW AS WE CAN POTENTIALLY WORK TOGETHER IN HOLDING AMAZON TO ACCOUNT ON THEIR FALSE CLAIMS AND POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.",1,“AMAZON RUINED MY CHRISTMAS - DO NOT TRUST AMAZON PRIME OR THEIR USELESS CUSTOMER SERVICE!”

Today January 8th Amazon.fr send me an email saying ""THEY ARE SORRY"" but the item was cancelled by them because there was a ""error"" on the price (Which is not my problem because I didn´t do anything wrong more than be a regular customer who bought the item and is waiting for it as a responsible website they claim to be).

What makes me think they want to cheat customers with this prcie changes, if there will be a ""mistake"" the system shouldn´t allow me to buy the item I think ... but imagine if I take an item on X price in their website (which I use to be a customer for several years and I will stop after this) and I pay less than the price because is ""my mistake"" they wont send me anything right? So now that is THEIR fault I will be without the item when I didn´t to anything wrong just click on the item and give all my personal data and card number to get the product that THEY post in that price, so basically they are forcing me to pay extra for the same thing when they post it on their site at X price now they want more for the item.

120,"I purchased an Amazon Echo in the US to use in Canada.  I originally used a US address to set it up and always wanted it to be based in Canada.  I was delighted when Amazon announced the Echo would be available in Canada.  I changed the address easily and all was good until I wanted to add a skill.  When I tried to add the skill it told me my language need to be set to Canadian English.  I went into the setting and Canadian English was not available.  

I called Amazon and after being passed to 5 people, I was told it had to be resolved by Amazon Canada and someone would get back to me.  They never did, but all of a sudden Canadian English could be selected but could not be saved to the Echo.  I again phoned Amazon, and after trying to get me to do the same things I had already done I was told that was just too bad, it was a US device and would only work in the US, even though the language selection was there it just would not save to the device. I spoke to a supervisor (Chase) and he said he would put in a problem report, but I have no reference or timeframe.  So a big International company like Amazon has a fundamental problem like not being able to save language preferences and it seems it is just too bad,

127,"I recently called Amazon to request a refund of fees for a service for which I'd not contracted. Amazon's very cheery customer service assured me it was no problem. I then explained that I no longer used the credit card to which the fee was being charged, so could they refund it to my bank account or  to another card? 

As these words were issuing from my mouth, the happy-go-lucky customer service representative sent the refund to the card I no longer used. When I asked why he did not allow me to explain what I needed, he became less cheery.

Needless to say, the credit card company where I no longer had an account had little time for my request to resend the funds to Amazon -- and who can blame them?

A second email to Amazon produced a boilerplate response. You get a prepared message that has some peripheral relationship to your request, and it tells you to look at the FAQ or something like that. 

A reply to this produced a response from a representative who seemed capable of logical reasoning. His reply, however, was grim: He explained that Amazon could do nothing, unless maybe the funds came back, and maybe not even then. 

It is somewhat amazing: Amazon is reputed to have the best customer service in the world, but it appears to be fraying at the edges. Too many bots, and not enough representatives? Or is there little difference these days at this company? I recommend you to take great care with your dealings with this mastodontic mess.",1,“Refund wreck” 
128,"I signed up for Amazon's Prime Membership trial. There was no fine print during the sign-up saying that I was actually subscribing to the full membership. There was no disclaimer saying that I had to cancel my subscription (not trial sign-up like it was advertised) if I did not want to pay $90 for something that I was not sure if I wanted or not. I was not hooked on Prime during the trial and so I did not subscribe to it afterward....... thinking that was the process.........

So... when the trial ended, Amazon automatically TOOK $90 from my credit card WITHOUT my knowledge. As far as I'm concerned, this company is shady and disreputable.

I requested a call from customer service, there was apparently an issue w/ my debit card, my bank issues a daily limit, which my order had exceeded. No problem, I asked the customer rep if I could give him my routing # and Bank acct # and he could withdraw the total.  He put me on hold and said he couldn't do it, it didn't work, I said how could you have tried it I haven't given you my bank info yet.  He tried to run my debit card again after I told him about the bank limit.  After trying to explain what I was asking again, I realized this moron doesn't know what I'm talking about.  I gave him a credit card, which took him about a 1/2 hour to figure out, I pull up my order while we're talking and it says 2 day delivery, guaranteed delivery by Tuesday, December 26th, meanwhile, today is Thursday, December 21, (2 days would be Saturday Dec. 23rd).  I brink this to the attention of the representative, I really want it delivered by Christmas...his solution is to cancel the order on his end and for me to go online and resubmit the order...are you fricken kidding me, I've just spend 45 minutes on the phone with this moron, telling him it's a Christmas present.  He can't change the delivery to overnight it on his end.  I ask to speak with his supervisor, I'm extremely uncomfortable at this point with anything he has to tell me.  He puts me on hold for a second and gets back on the phone and states that he's not going to put me on with a supervisor because he's one of the supervisors in his department. I've never wrote a review for any company before, good or bad, but the person I spoke to clearly had no idea what he was doing and I would have thought w/ all the trouble I had with this order that they may have given me better assistance in expediting the order.

My problem with Amazon is actually with their third-party sellers. Amazon is not doing its due diligence in determining whether these are reputable sellers worthy of having access to Amazon's advertising and customers. My kindle is full of books bought with free books given me by Amazon due to countless gaffs by; ""Yep, you guessed it""; third party sellers. Unfortunately most of the items I require are not offered by Amazon, and therefore NOT stocked in their warehouses. I have been sent items that I did not order instead of what I did order, I have NOT received anything at all, I have been informed the day before the item was supposed to be delivered, that it would not be coming at all. My laundry list of reasons why I am BOYCOTTING AMAZON. But none of them are actually Amazon's fault. Well, not directly their fault. But their negligence in rectifying this state of affairs, has created or allowed this deplorable inconsistency in service to exist. That being said; if Amazon were to take my countless suggestions about eliminating Third-party sellers, or were they to find a way to find some way to ensure me that I would receive what I ordered, when I ordered it, or if they could guarantee a significantly earlier email telling me the item cannot be delivered.

I was told in order to do so, they would credit my Amazon account the amount and would reorder.  This was supposed to be credited within 1-2 hours.  Nope.  So i called again and spoke to someone else who magically was able to immediately credit my account.  So i immediately ordered the shoes and called back like i was told to do. I was then told the shoes would be overnighted on December 6 and i would receive them on December 7.  I was even given a tracking number.  Turns out she lied and gave me tracking number for the shoes i already had.  She also said i would get a $20 credit on my account. Great.

October 9, 2017 12:51:44 PM Rachel (CSA) : Since your warranty was purchased from our third party seller we will need to contact them and request that they cancel the order and issue a refund since the warranty does not meet your needs.

October 9, 2017 12:52:17 PM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : Becoz in order to make the order, I bought the gift card.

October 9, 2017 12:53:49 PM Rachel (CSA) : The item you purchased does not belong to Amazon.com. There is a different process.

October 9, 2017 12:54:28 PM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : I understand that. but I confirmed this from 2 amazon support team, before making an order. they could have said they don't know but they said it has international warranty and moreover one of your support team said 2 years warranty

October 9, 2017 12:56:36 PM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : "" However, if you intend to keep the warranty payment is necessary."" What does this mean?

October 9, 2017 12:57:13 PM Rachel (CSA) : That means if you do not want us to cancel the refund, we will not be able to refund it.

October 9, 2017 12:57:49 PM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : I don't want order to be cancelled

October 9, 2017 12:57:57 PM Rachel (CSA) : Ok.

October 9, 2017 12:58:21 PM Rachel (CSA) : For the misinformation, I can offer you a $5 promotional credit.

October 9, 2017 12:59:39 PM Rachel (CSA) : As previous agents and supervisors have informed you earlier, we can not honor that request.

October 9, 2017 1:00:05 PM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : So you mean, the Amazon support team can give any wrong information to their clients, and a client don't have any right to be compensated.

October 9, 2017 1:01:07 PM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : Can you transfer this call to anyone senior?

October 9, 2017 1:01:11 PM Rachel (CSA) : We have given you the option to cancel your order, so that may be you can find one that will better suit your needs. I also see that other agents have offered you promotional credits, as well.

October 9, 2017 1:01:47 PM Rachel (CSA) : I am a supervisor with Amazon, the supervisors above me, at my site do not take talk customer chats or calls.

October 9, 2017 1:01:54 PM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : I need $400 Amazon Gift card as compensation, as I need to pay $400 for the Dell Warranty.

October 9, 2017 1:02:10 PM Rachel (CSA) : Again, we are not going to be able to offer you that.

October 9, 2017 1:02:57 PM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : Why?

October 9, 2017 1:03:52 PM Rachel (CSA) : It is not warranted in this situation. I understand that this is frustrating. We have given you the options that are available to you.

October 9, 2017 1:04:04 PM Rachel (CSA) : But we can not give you a $400 gift card.

October 9, 2017 1:06:14 PM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : Thank you for you superb customer service. I hope if you keep this up, you will soon lose trust of many of your customers. Good Luck. Never going to come back to Amazon ever.

October 9, 2017 5:19:01 AM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : Ok

October 9, 2017 5:22:36 AM Michael W. (CSA) : I do see the information that was provided in your contact on October 7, 2017 prior to placing the order. Once again, I'm very sorry for the incorrect information you were provided, but the terms of the warranty are through the manufacturer, not Amazon. Since the order has not shipped, it's still possible for us to send the seller a cancellation request.

October 9, 2017 5:22:57 AM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : First of all I don't want the order to be cancelled

October 9, 2017 5:23:23 AM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : Secondly, yes it was prior to placing the order. I made the order after getting all those information from your support

October 9, 2017 5:23:41 AM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : Had your support told me the correct information, I could have looked into other alternatives?

October 9, 2017 5:23:58 AM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : But since I was filled up with incorrect information, I made a purchase of $2000 amazon gift card

October 9, 2017 5:24:12 AM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : and then I paid the remaining from my card.

October 9, 2017 5:24:33 AM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : Two incorrect informations were provided

October 9, 2017 5:24:38 AM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : 1st it has 2 years warranty

October 9, 2017 5:24:44 AM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : 2nd it has warranty for India too

October 9, 2017 5:25:01 AM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : If the support team doesn't have answer they could have said me to talk to seller directly.

October 9, 2017 5:25:27 AM Michael W. (CSA) : I completely understand, but we cannot force the manufacturer to honor a warranty that's being shipped outside the US. In terms of compensation for the incorrect information, I'm willing to make a one-time exception, and issue a $50 Amazon promotional credit to your account. You can use the credit towards your next purchase that is shipped and sold by Amazon.com.

October 9, 2017 5:26:23 AM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : Well, I know you cannot force the manufacture, but dell provides premium support for international warranty, but that costs extra fee, So if you could compensate the seller the cost of premium support for the laptop which includes international warranty for 2 years.

October 9, 2017 5:27:18 AM Michael W. (CSA) : Do you know how much the premium support costs, Kaushal?

October 9, 2017 5:27:28 AM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : please talk to seller,

October 9, 2017 5:27:40 AM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : better he tell you instead of me giving some kind of incorrect answer

October 9, 2017 5:28:13 AM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : If Amazon will pay for 2 years international warranty, then I will feel myself compensated for the incorrect information

October 9, 2017 5:29:26 AM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : I will need to leave now. Please send me the copy of this chat to my email. and also mail me the further details about your actions for compensating me. Thank you

October 9, 2017 5:30:42 AM Michael W. (CSA) : I've looked through the correspondence between you and the seller, and I'm afraid I see no mention of premium support in regards to the warranty.

October 7, 2017 5:59:13 PM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : So does that mean SMART GUARD will pick my order ORDER # 113-2215371-0609818 and deliver it to me??

October 7, 2017 6:00:24 PM Ruben (CSA) : I see that one is a laptop and the other is insurance plan for the laptop, Am I right?

October 7, 2017 6:00:30 PM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : yes

October 7, 2017 6:00:56 PM Ruben (CSA) : They both will be delivered to you as two separate orders, Kaushal.

October 7, 2017 6:01:20 PM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : ok.. So does that mean during shipment if anything happens to my laptop. then Smart Guard will be applicable on it

October 7, 2017 6:01:54 PM Ruben (CSA) : Yep, That's right!

The Smart Guard will cover the expensed if anything happens to laptop.

October 7, 2017 6:02:17 PM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : And will the laptop be delivered to my door step, or I need to visit some custom office

October 7, 2017 6:03:04 PM Ruben (CSA) : It will be delivered to the address that you have given while placing the order.

October 7, 2017 6:03:20 PM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : Will I be charged anything else, like custom duty etc.?

October 7, 2017 6:05:33 PM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : I checked my bank account, the amount has not yet been deducted.

October 7, 2017 6:05:56 PM Ruben (CSA) : You will be charged once the item ships, Kaushal.

October 7, 2017 6:06:49 PM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : does that mean I could be charged even more than what was mentioned?

October 7, 2017 6:08:19 PM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : he told me he will try to adjust that by talking to shipment

October 7, 2017 6:08:49 PM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : I don't need any cashback. if you could make discount over my current order, I will be very happy

October 7, 2017 6:10:18 PM Ruben (CSA) : The thing is the laptop you have ordered is sold and shipped by a third party seller and we don't have any authority on their inventory and shipping. The third party sellers on amazon work independently. So I'm afraid I can't add any discount to the current order.

And moreover we don't have an option to do so as well.

October 7, 2017 6:10:45 PM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : May I remove my cards from amazon.. As I already made the orders

October 7, 2017 6:11:15 PM KAUSHAL KUMAR SINGH : or do I need to keep my card into amazon account until unless you charge me

October 7, 2017 6:11:54 PM Ruben (CSA) : Please wait till the orders get charged Kaushal.

Once the items are shipped, you can remove them so there won't be any problem to your account.

158,"We received a gift card for our wedding. One month later we attempted to redeem the credit and were told that someone else already had. We did not authorize this and had no idea. Spoke to 5 different customer service people that explained there is nothing they can do. They have a deeply flawed system and dont believe their own customers, so the gift was just wiped out. No offer of credit or even to discuss it with fraud prevention, just wanted to get us off the phone. Now my wife is crying.",1,"“Amazon gets hacked, we lose money, and they refuse to help” "
159,"Have been a loyal amazon customer for years. Always happy until now. My account was hacked a couple of months ago so it was temporarily suspended. Have repeatedly called customer service to get this reversed to no avail. Never send e-mails or return phone calls as promised. Amazon is convenient, but I can make my purchase directly through vendors. To bad amazon has gotten so big they no longer need my business.",1,“Terrible customer service.” 
160,"Amazon Customer Service is terrible.  If you want to contact someone to get more information all they do is copy a link to their help section of their website, they state they cannot help in their department and place you on hold.  The next rep then does the same thing, offers you a link to their help section so that you can read and research for yourself. ***Poor customer service***",1,“Amazon Customer Service” 
161,"I order a mattress cover. I was sent the wrong size. The mattress cover was sent in a 6 foot huge box and it was vacuum seal. So when I opened it , it was 10 times bigger. To my surprise they have sent me the wrong size . I have call amazon many of times about this item . I have no way of sending it back, because I can not get back in the box. I have no use for this. Amazon refuse to tell me how to repack it to ship it back or give me a refund. Then after days of calling finally a amazon rep promise me I would get a refund for my trouble. I ask her twice she said yes I would. Just to make sure I called back and ask a second amazon rep she said yes you are getting a refund. The next day I am told I am not, they cant help me with shipping it back either. I am stuck with something I have to pay for that I have no use for. Will not ever shop with amazon again. They very rude and not honest",1,“I was promised a refund and then refused” 
162,"I'm done with Amazon when my Prime Membership Expires.  I would rather have the $119 in my pocket.  Customer service has become horrible and appears to be based in India.  Last contact to them involved several phone calls within a 30 minute time span where they kept disconnecting me.  They won't accept my reviews (even favorable ones) for products I have purchased from their site, which now leads me to believe many of the reviews are fake. Prime video I think is a joke.  I don't believe this company is what it used to be.  IMHO you can get Walmart and Target to match Amazon's prices.  In my opinion, the purpose of Amazon is to get you to buy products you don't actually need.  IMHO they do not have the lowest prices, and I have actually purchased products such as vitamins and supplements for far less cost on Ebay.  I don't need two day shipping, and I am sick of calling Amazon for a one month prime extension when a two day shipment arrives late.",1,“I'm done with Amazon.  Good riddance.” 
163,I just don't understand why it takes Amazon so long to ship out products if you have Prime they ship it out within 24 hours if you go with the free shipping they ship it out 5 to 7 Days Later this way it make you bye their Prime. I can go to Walmart or jet or any other company and they ship it out within 24 hours so I have called them multiple times about this but it seems like it doesn't help so I have decided not do business with Amazon no more until they change their policy maybe if everybody does this they'll change there policy or maybe it will make them go out of business and would just start shopping at Walmart and jet,1,“Bad business if you don't have their Prime”

Amazon has no conscience. They used to sell even whale meat. When is enough?",1,“The site you love to hate” 
167,"I purchased a 65 inch SUHD TV through Amazon.com.  I purchased within their marketplace sector of their website.  The TV was delivered damaged.  Amazon has refused to help.

Here is the main problem.

Amazon marketplace is a wild west of vendors that apparently have no vetting process and some are not even companies.  This was my experience.  I purchased the TV from a vendor called Infinity Loop.  Infinity loop initially talked to me and gave me a phone number when i reported the damaged TV.  I called and the warehouse didn't even know who Infinity Loop was.  I had to explain my purchase from Amazon and the operator directed me to a rep.  That rep said they would have get the owner to call back.  Well that never happened.  They stopped communicating all together.  I had to use Amazon messaging (dozens of attempts to get them to respond).  I eventually contacted Amazon who gave me a warm and fuzzy about helping me.  Well after . several supervisors and several warm and fuzzies they eventually said they couldn't help and wouldn't continue to respond.  

Here is the problem.  I received the TV damaged.  It's obvious by the pictures it's a forklift punch through the box and into the screen.  I asked the driver about the hole in the box and he told me it happens all the time and put my hand through it and check.   He assured me the TV's are always fine.  I checked and only felt that soft velvety cover they put over the screens.  Nothing at all made me think that the screen actually was touched.  I was in the process of moving and didn't unpack the well packed TV just to repack it for my move.  My mistake.  I should have unpacked and checked it.  HOWEVER it doesn't change the fact it was delivered DAMAGED.  When i unpacked it i saw a small tear (about the size of a dime) in the outer cover.  I took the cover off and found the deep gouge in the screen but no cracking or any other visible damage.  I plugged it in and the screen was totally unusable.  Since then it's been a very disappointing experience with Amazon.  No matter what evidence I've sent in regarding the size/shape of the hole fitting a warehouse forklift fork....the link between Mizari and Infinity Loop....the shipping company acknowledging the damage likely happened while in their control (only Mizari can file a claim as the account holder).....my horrible experience trying to work with Amazon customer service......they disappeared and forced me to seek legal advice.

I've had to file a small claims case against Amazon to try to get my money back.  

Infinity Loop doesn't exist.  There is no business license for them anywhere.  I did research the warehouse and phone number and found out they are actually called MIZARI Enterprises.  Mizari denies any knowledge of Infinity Loop.  Mizari and Infinity loop have the same address in Commerce CIty, CA and have the same phone number.  The shipping receipt has Mizari's address on Wilshire Blvd in Los Angeles.  Mizari shipped the TV.  The shipping company confirmed this.  It's amazing to me that AMAZON is defending MIZARI and their fraudulent marketplace vendor INIFINITY LOOP and not their customer. 

Amazon marketplace is a huge gamble and risk should anything go wrong",1,“Amazon marketplace has fraudulent companies selling through their website” 
168,"A fraud transaction of Rs. 35000.00 was happens on 18.10.2016 from my  SBICARD ending No. 000000000....9050 which was credited to the AMAZAN   SVCS account vide authentication code 053331 and reference number is 74332746293629285011544 (As per given by SBICARD Authority)

In spite of lots of communications by mail (no reply from AMAZON end) and telephonic conversations with the customer care service I did not get satisfactory reply from their end.   

I wanted to take details information i.e. name, address,who placed the order etc. against that fraud transaction of Rs.35000.00. But AMAZON SVCS denied to disclosed & inform me. Means The AMAZON is involved with the frauder (Mob No.-9916220929). Still AMAZON neither reimburse my harden earned money of Rs.35000.00 nor provide details information of frauder.

Amazon has capitalized on this and with all their money are making purchasing even more convenient.  This is putting small brick and mortar places out of business and they don't seem to care either.  Amazon's business practices are akin to that of Wal-Mart and what they have done to small business.  Amazon is the the final nail in the coffin.,1,“Putting Small Businesses OUT OF BUSINESS” 
175,"I was a Amazon prime customer. I ordered a surface pro 4 laptop and keyboard worth £2300 for next day delivery and was waiting at home eagerly awaiting delivery. It never arrived and when I checked the status on Amazon website, I was shocked to see the status updated as delivered and parcel handed over to the residents at my address. Nobody rang my door bell or knocked. I was home just to receive the delivery.

Now I am entangled in an unnecessary dispute resolution involving american express and amazon. Amazon hasn't so far provided any proof of who signed for the parcel. Every time I call them I reach a new customer service rep who keeps saying they will get back to me within 48 hrs. And later send an email saying the parcel has been delivered to my address. 

I have cancelled my prime membership since then and still awaiting a resolution for this and kicking myself as to why i didn't walk into the nearest John Lewis showroom and buy the item like I normally do. 

BITTERNESS OF POOR QUALITY REMAINS LONG AFTER THE SWEETNESS OF LOW PRICE IS FORGOTTEN!

176,"Being a seller in Amazon's marketplace is now a bit of a joke. Like eBay, it's been one round of 'compliance' after another, sometimes due to EU rules treating everyone as potential money-laundering terrorists.

As a seller, I was working for peanuts, as the competition is so great and the 15% commission excessive. 

With increasing use of Amazon's FBA (fulfilled by Amazon), I was increasingly failing to win the 'Buy Box' and so losing out on orders, as many people don't bother to compare prices and sellers. Even when I was cheapest and with 100% feedback, Amazon and FBA sellers were just about always, if not always, rewarded with the Buy Box.

From now on, I am going to try to grow my brand without Amazon. For one thing, customer loyalty is almost zero with Amazon marketplace.

The danger for consumers is that, because Amazon has been happy to work for next to no profit for years, they are able to undercut almost everyone. And because of Amazon's vast reach, many businesses feel that they have to sell there, often selling at lower prices than on their own website, despite Amazon's charges.

The consequence could be that in another decade or two, nearly all internet sales are handled through third party sites like eBay and Amazon. Businesses will basically no longer be independent, increasing merchandise will be banned as they are deemed politically incorrect (such as all Confederate flag items, as just one example).

They will be able to set prices by setting their fees and we will only have easy access to the books they think we ought to read and the music and films we should own and the food we should eat.

Join me in boycotting Amazon, as a seller and as a buyer, otherwise we will be at the mercy of these kind of companies and in my experience, they don't do much in the way of mercy.",1,“Amazon: a danger in waiting?”

3) I was told that the only way to address the issue was to be refunded for the missing item and re-order the missing item.  
4) Why is the customer required to take these actions when it is clearly the fault of Amazon and the inadequacy of their product supply process.  Your Customer Service did not provide any applicable service, since they do not have the ability to process an order over the phone, only view the order and offer upgraded shipping options, which in fact did not improve the arrival date.

BEWARE OF BUYING THIS PRODUCT FULFILLED BY AMAZON!!!
BEWARE OF BUYING THIS PRODUCT FULFILLED BY AMAZON FOR THE $12.95 PRICE.
RECEIVED BOTTLE AND LOOKED FOR EXPIRE DATE, IT WAS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BOTTLE PRINTED ON A STICKER THAT WAS SLITED INTO 4 SECTIONS. I AM FAMILIAR WITH THIS PRODUCT, I HAVE PURCHASED IT IN THE PAST SO I KNOW WHERE THE EXPIRE DATE SHOULD BE. WHERE IT SHOULD BE WAS ON THE EDGE OF THE BOTTLE'S LABEL, BUT COVERING THE EDGE OF THE LABEL THERE WAS A LONG AMAZON LABEL WITH THE NAME OF THE PRODUCT AND AMAZON'S BAR CODE. I PEELED OFF AMAZON'S LABEL TO FIND THE EDGE OF THE BOTTLE'S LABEL HAD BEEN CUT OFF, I COULD SEE THE RAZOR BLADE MARK LEFT ON THE BOTTLE. I PEELED OFF THE STICKER ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BOTTLE TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING UNDER IT, THERE WAS NOTHING. THIS STICKER LABEL SAID EXPIRE DATE 7/18. I CALLED HOTSTUFF AND TALKED TO PAUL, HE VERIFIED WERE THE EXPIRE DATE SHOULD BE...ON THE EDGE OF THE LABEL. SENT IT BACK. I'LL BE SURPRISED IF AMAZON POSTS THIS REVIEW.

Paul from Hotstuff ran the lot # on the bottle's label and it's actual expire date is 8/2017....Go figure!

202,I am a Community Manager at an apartment community and for the 2nd time in the past 2 weeks Amazon delivery person left our residents packages outside our leasing office because they were too lazy to deliver them to their customers door. One deliver person literally stated that he is not delivering in the rain and that these Amazon customers can come outside our leasing office and fight for the packages. Every since Amazon started using people off the street to deliver their packages the delivery service has been awful. They are dressed unprofessionally and act rude. Also to try and resolve this over the phone is impossible. I have been transferred 4 times and didn't get anywhere and was not taken seriously. I am very disappointed in Amazon for letting this happen. Every single day they try to bring tons of packages into our leasing office without attempting delivery. P.S. Amazon we do not get paid to do your job.,1,“Awful delivery service” 
203,"I used to shop on Amazon a lot. The products I received were hit or miss and so were their prices. Often times when I compared pricing - eBay, Etsy, Wal-Mart, Target, and Kohls would have the same or very similar items at lower prices, even if you're paying for a Prime account w/""free"" (paid for) shipping.  

But why did I really stop shopping at Amazon? Because Amazon is the reason why over a million workers (between their business and USPS who delivers for them) do not get to enjoy major holidays like  Easter, Memorial Day, Independence  Day, Labor Day,Thanksgiving, and Christmas with their families - because now they're forced to have to be out delivering for Amazon, which could and should allow ALL deliveries to stop for all major holidays. People survived for hundreds of years not getting mail on major holidays or Sundays. Now USPS workers do not get that one (saving grace) day a week to rest their bodies (Sundays), especially between November and February when they need it the most. Amazon is DIRECTLY responsible for lowering the quality of life and family time and rest time for over a million American workers. And because odd that, I had to quit the USPS and have been unemployed and struggling to find work ever since.  I could not physically work 7-day work weeks and miss holidays with my family - and Amazon caused that.  I will never shop from them again and I tell all my fault and friends to do likewise. A few have stopped shopping from them for the same reasons.",1,“Fast shipping equals employees without days off. Products hit or miss.”

I HAVE 73 EMAILS FROM THAT 30 DAY PERIOD FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE, WHERE I HAD TO CALL IN ABOUT PROBLEMS WITH ORDSERS, BEING CHARGED TWICE FOR SAME ORDER, ONCE WHEN PLACED, THENAGAIN WHEN SHIPPED, AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT PENDING CHARGES, BUT CHARGES THAT WERE PROCESSED. NEEDLASS TO SAY, I MADE SURE I GOT ALL ITEMS REURNED BEFORE THE 30 DAYS WERE UP. ANYONE CAN SHOP THERE, BUT YOU DON'T GET THAT 2 DAY FREE SHIPPING. AND NOW THAT THEY CHARGE TAX ON EVERY ORDER, WHICH ID AGAINST THE LAW IN MY STATE, SINCE THEY DON'T HAVE A DISTRIBUTION CENTER WITHIN THE STATE, YOU MIGHT AS WELL BUY LOCALLY. WHEN I ASKED THEY SAID IT WAS FEDERAL LAW. THAT'S A FLAT OUT LIE, SALES TAX LAWS DIFFER FROM STATE TO STATE AS DOES AMOUNT, AND SOME STATES DON'T CHARGE ANY SALES TAX ON EDIBLE GOODS, YET AMAZON COLLECTS ON ALL. BUT THEY CAN'T BE TRUNING IT IN TO THE STATES, JUST ANOTHER WAY TO INCREASE PROFITS. ONE ITEM I ORDERED FROM PRIME, CAME FROM A 3 RD PARTY VENDOR, HE LEFT THE INVOICE IN THE BOX, THE MARK UP WAS 100%, I PAID 48.05, AMAZON PAID 24.67. THEY HAVE NO OVERHEAD BUT THE COST OF THE WEBSITE AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REOS OVER THE PHONE, WHICH IS 70% OUTSOURCED TO MANILLA AND INDIA, ONE AMAZON REP,USA BASED, ADMITTED HE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE MANILA WAS, OR THAT INDIA WAS A COUNTRY, THOUGHT IT WAS THE NAME OF A CONTINENT. AGAIN POORLY TRAINED, SITE DIFFICULT TO USE, TOO MUCH TIME TO RESOLVE ISSUES, AN AVERAGE OF 3 CALLS AND 2 HOURS ON PHONE EVERYTIME.

I contacted Amazon to see if I could get some type of refund to compensate for the $1000 difference.  They said I would have to repackage the 90 pound TV (box has been broken down) send it back and buy a new TV at the lower price. I am unable to do that as now I have no box and explained to the customer service rep that I don't see how them getting back a now used TV is any smarter than me losing $1000.

I would always order from Amazon and use the Super Saver Shipping, and most of the time, I would get my purchases earlier than the expected delivery date.
Once I became an invitee to a Prime membership, I would get my packages in the guaranteed 2 days.
Lately, there have been numerous late packages. I would say 9 out of 10 packages are late. When I see ""Guaranteed Delivery"" by a certain date, I absolutely count on that. Especially, if it's a gift for someone.
As if late packages weren't bad enough, 8 out of 10 items arrive damaged. It's a shame that the convenience of ordering products from Amazon.com has come with the inconvenience of damaged item returns so frequently.
I had asked a representative about accessing Prime music or video through my account, and was told that as a member, I can access it. When it didn't work, I had to speak to someone in music department and was told that as an invitee to Prime, I am not entitled to the free music downloads with my own account.
Customer service has been terrible in giving wrong information, and promising replacements the next day that don't arrive, then nonchalantly say that it'll be there the day after. This becomes a problem when you're expecting it that day, and sometimes, even wait for it.
2 years ago, Amazon.com would've gotten 5 stars from me. Being a customer for over 10 years have seen how far down hill they have gone. Their customer service used to be tops, and delivery was always on point.

Since they arrived too late to return we had no way of replacing them and they just had to be tossed out. When Amazon sent me the email to review the different products I had purchased they accepted ALL EXCEPT the review for this company stating that they arrived late, vendor did not reply to email sent, and the engraving was wrong on both of them. BEWARE of the reviews on Amazon as they are very selective of which one they will allow to be posted. The only thing in their guidelines that they sent me for why they could have possibly denied my review is that the purchase must be $50 or mores. The irony is most of the other purchase they had me review for the same event were all under $50 but as they were mostly positive it seems that was the criteria used as to which ones they allowed to be posted and which one they denied to post.",1,“Amazon prevents unfavorable reviews from being posted on vendors”

Fortunately, my gut told me to cancel the accounts associated with the account a week earlier and I acted on it.  I once had a seller account in 2007 but stopped using it because the only sales I made were from fraudulent accounts.  I guess the hackers knew how to activate it.

Associates are running around having to beat their time instead of focusing on getting the job done in a safe manner. The store only had 2 days without injury which speaks for itself. On my first day, an associate was bleeding from his cheek. Injuries range from knee, arm, head, foot, etc. Working conditions are not what they are suppose to be like for human beings. Vending machines are broken in order to get proper PPE (e.g. gloves, glove liners). I am canceling my Amazon Prime membership and never buying from Amazon again. Working conditions are disgusting. Being fast should not be what is important, SAFETY is what is important. Amazon would not be the world's most ""customer-centric company"" without its associates. One can't even utilize the restroom unless they are on break or lunch, because it affects their time, and management will take note of it, so additionally employees must also train their bladder.

Instead of having employees yell ""CORNER"" and ""CROSSING"" when moving along the aisles, you would benefit from not timing employees like they are animals fetching, and concentrate on a humane work environment that is safe for all.

the human element. Amazon has caused many losses of jobs that
at this time are a huge necessity to maintain incomes for working
people at other companies!. I just read Amazon might take over Costco!
Think of the people at Kroger or other supermarkets!. I always receive
automated phone calls from St. Judes hospital asking for money to
maintain free medical care which need money for children to prevent
their death and possibly confront diseases which are debilitating.
Mr. Bezos should take some of his billions and help others.
We should never see or hear from St. Jude Hospital!
Medicare etc are nearly out the door. Millions are facing no insurance
or any solution to healthcare!. Instead of overtaking other companies
help others in need.!  Bill Gates is an example of a generous
and kind with his fortune.  Lets face it, humans will never outlive money!
Money stays no matter what!. Mr. Bezos what is the deal!
With your big bucks no one should suffer lack of medical care!
Maybe, you lack in good judgement is failing as a good and caring
individual!.  Share the wealth instead of hogging it for yourself
and Amazon!

When you buy something and saying you will get it by tomorrow and you find out (( delivery refused)) it happened 3 times waisting of time and money ! I'm going to try to do shopping for other provider ! So Who's next!!,1,“Amazon getting worth” 
330,I ordered some items on black Friday weekend and used my Sears rewards points. Well I clicked on a button that changed my method of payment  in one press. An option I did not set myself in my Amazon account it just came that way. So I called customer service to have it taken from the correct payment method and they stole my reward dollars. It was $45.02 it wasn't a million dollars but it was mine and it should have come off my order total. The representative I spoke to was in a rush to get me off the phone and lied to me telling me that I got the reward dollars.  But I  just got my Sears credit card statement and it shows that they took all my reward points and charged me full price for my items. I may just cancel my account with them. I don't like thieves or liars,1,“Thieves” 
331,"This is the first time I've ever had a complaint about Amazon. 

The #AmazonPrime payment process is ridiculous and borderline unethical. I went in to pay through the student page so that I can see the student price. It didn't come up when I hit ""continue,"" nor was there a button or drop arrow to get the student discount. There was no breakdown of payment or ""confirm payment"" button, as there usually is, so I hit continue and was informed that I was signed up for #Amazon Prime. THEN I got a notification from my credit card company that $105 had been charged to my account. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. WHEN YOU SAY ""THE FIRST HOWEVER-MANY-MONTHS IS FREE,"" THAT MEANS YOU DO NOT PAY UNTIL THAT FREE PERIOD IS OVER. THAT IS HOW IT WORKS WITH EVERY PAYMENT PROGRAM. Additionally, nowhere does it SAY that we will be charged immediately.",1,“Amazon Prime”

I was not aware at the time of the purchase that this item was coming from an individual. My order gets updated on 12/15 with a bogus tracking number and the status has not changed since 12/15. I contact Amazon and all I get is you will have to contact the seller and wait 1-2 weeks for a refund. I have contacted the seller several times and there is no phone number and you can only email them. Amazon still will not take responsibility for scammers on their site. When my account was debited it shows Amazon. But they are saying that they gave the money to the seller and will not refund me because the item has been shipped. Even though they can see that the tracking number is not valid on the USPS site. They have no records of the tracking number. The has been the worst experience ever. And all they keep saying is that we cant refund you and this is the only order that you have placed. I guess because they are under the assumption that I have only placed one order they dont care. We have over 10 accounts with them because everyone in my house has their own account. So with that being said I guess because this account only shows 1 Im not important to them. And yes all of my accounts have prime membership and on top of that its not the free trial. Its a paid subscription. They have people who get on the phones and claim to be managers of the company and when you call back for them no one knows who they are. I also think that thats unfair to lie to your customers to get them off the phone. I have given them nothing but good reviews in the past but after this I will never think to use them again. Everyone be very careful of what you purchase on this site. Because its not up to Amazon to give you a refund its up to the seller. So if your item ships and you never get it you will wait forever for a refund and to think this was a Christmas Gift. And yes my money is very precious to me when I work for it everyday.

First it was looking just wonderfull. I sell new cases for tablet pc and other staff but in used directory. Because you can't sell on amazon new staff without official license from manufacturer. But then I sold used Canon digital camera and my account was stopped for a while. With all my money on it - there was 112euro. Amazon explain it so: I violate intellectual property of Canon. When I asked how could this be when I was selling USED CANON CAMERA!?
there where no answer. then after 2 weeks I received letter that amazon decide to close my seller account. Ok. But I ask them to withdraw my balance to my bank account. They told me - that it going to happen automatically. 3 month later - nothing. No money no connection with amazon - because my account is already closed so I can't enter it and withdraw my money by my self. All I hear from amazon: if you have a problem contact us directly from your account. When I explain my problem they advice my to login and contact them directly from my seller account. 
So amazon.com for me is just another global fraudsters with huge money which they've  stolen from persons like me. without any explanations.

They will accuse you of copyright infringement and reject your book over and over. Sure I sold a few books, but I don't think it was worth the aggravation. I would advise you to look elsewhere.

341,"I bought a Grundig Satellit 750 Radio from Amazon, when it arrived in Bago City Philippines the shorwave did not work.   I had been warned that Amazon will often ship defective items to people who will have difficulties returning these!   I could not afford the $100 out of pocket after spending so much for this radio (plus customs and shipping) $558.59.  Amazon did not offer to reimburse me for the total costs to ship the item back to them DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE ITEM WAS DEFECTIVE  (offering only up to $20.00 of it).  So since the AM/FM works I decided to keep this DEFECTIVE RADIO!  Well due to the fact that our voltage is 220V here, I ordered a power cord for this radio from Super Power Supply and according to Amazon it was shipped via DHL but when I contacted DHL they said it was shipped via Global Mail ( REGULAR MAIL) but I paid $18.00 for this item to be shipped here via DHL EXPRESS!  I then went online to write a scathing review of this product and received this""Your review could not be posted.""  According to Amazon's TOS... This is the copy of that review.

""Buyer Beware SCAM ALERT!

I live in the Philippines and paid Amazon to ship this to my home address. According to Amazon it was shipped by DHL. According to DHL this item went Global Mail! I have not received the package. I can not ask for a refund due to the fact that I can't send back a package that I have not received! I have asked them to send another one but I doubt that this company will. I paid $18.00 with shipping and customs! This was not CHEAP SHIPPING! Yet this company decided to ship it via regular Philippines Post and lie and say that DHL shipped it! Do not trust this company! I have not received the item. I have waited a very long time to write this. I wrote a review earlier (thinking it was with DHL due to Amazon but this review is about the fact that it WAS NOT SENT VIA DHL) I guess we can't trust AMAZON either! Since their site says it was shipped via DHL!

Your review should focus on specific features of the product and your experience with it. Feedback on the seller or your shipment experience should be provided at www.amazon.com/feedback.
We do not allow profane or obscene content. This applies to adult products too.
Advertisements, promotional material or repeated posts that make the same point excessively are considered spam.

This review you will notice does not have any foul language in it, other than mentioning Amazon several times and my expectation that when they say they shipped something via DHL that it actually is shipped via DHL and not REGULAR MAIL!.  You can not trust Amazon.  They will send you broken items that cost you hundreds of dollars due to the fact that you would not wish to trust them, or pay the very high return shipping costs!  But also they say that they ship a item via a carrier and it turns out to be a LIE!  Do not trust these two companies!
     There are very few companies that allow one the selection Amazon does and for me and others who are living in a foreign country (I'm from the USA) a company like this is very useful.  But when they send a radio as they did me, that is DEFECTIVE and which I paid such a large sum for, and then only offer $20 to return it...well enough said(?)  Do not trust Amazon with expensive purchases.  Do not trust the company I bought the cord from, as it was not the correct cord and was not shipped by DHL but by regular mails which has a history of theft here!  Ok?  So that is all I have to say about this.",1,“Defective items and shipping...”

354,"So, my Kindle Voyager died that I purchased in Feb. 2015.  I jump on chat, they take me through the paces, and decide it can't be fixed.  What do you mean it can't be fixed?  It's just a dead battery.  Oh, we can't fix hardware problems.  Okay, well, I'm not paying $199 retail for a brand new one, so, what can you do?  Answer: $20 off a new one.  NOPE!  I call, speak with a guy named Arthur.  I explain everything, and he says not to worry; which immediately made me suspicious.  I tell him I need to purchase it on a payment plan after he tells me he's selling me the new device for $100.  He says he'll give me $40 credit to be used as the first payment, and put $59.99 in my account to be used to make subsequent payments.  I made him explain this 3 times.  He kept saying not to worry, and he'd send me an email with all the details and his name ... just purchase the device, and he'll do all these things on his end.  So, I do it and wait for the email.  I get the email, and it says $159.99 for the device with payments to begin the first month and his name is missing.  Now, all the messed up crap begins.  I decide they lie over the phone, so I start a chat.  The woman is a moron and can't understand what I said happened during the transaction on the previous day.  We go around and around, and then she then says she found $59.99 sitting in promotional credits and can't be applied to payments.  WHAT?  What does that mean?  It means the $59.99 can only be used for future purchases.  I tell her that's not right, and someone needs to fix this.  She passes me onto someone else who says he will refund $59.99 to my card.  Hours have past, and it's like 1am.  I'm so tired at this point, I'm almost falling asleep.  I tell him to do so, and I'll check back the next day.  I check my account & emails the next day, and nothing happened.  I'm saving some of these chats since amazon.com conveniently doesn't allow you to save them.  I call to speak with a supervisor, and I'm already tired and frustrated.  I get passed around, put on hold for 45 minutes, and hang up.  I call back and get hung up on at least 5 times.  Now, I'm steaming mad.  I'm back to chats since people are jerking me around over the phone.  I tell them someone needs to fix this, redo the payment schedule so that the device is $100 like Arthur promised me it would be.  I get passed around some more.

I ask to speak with a supervisor, and I'm absolutely sure I wasn't speaking with a supervisor who blew me off.  Every month, I'm chatting with people, pasting previous chats in the window from Word documents, and asking them what they plan to do.  I get the device, and one of them tells me to send it back and they'll redo everything for $100.  I ask him if he thinks I'm stupid, because everybody is saying something different and now I don't trust any of them.  Send me an email saying this is what would happen if I send it back.  He says no, which makes me know he's lying too.  In September, I file a BBB complaint.  Whoever answered refunds $41 because they took so long, I bought some mp3's which reduced the credit, and before I could ask about redoing the payment schedule, the BBB closes the case.  So, I enter another BBB complaint about that.  Nothing happens.  I get into another chat whereby that rep says he will have someone from the BBB division of Amazon.com address the complaint.  Nothing happens again after a couple of weeks.  So, then I enter in a complaint with the Attorney General of the State of Washington ... Seattle.  Someone at Amazon.com sends back a double-talking response without addressing the payment plan ... again.  The Attorney General's office says there's nothing they can do and to go to small claims court for resolution.  I send back an email with ALL the chats attached and tell them I've been deceived, and small claims court where?  Washington?  I don't think so!  These people act like this isn't an online company and the laws of one State can govern the laws of another.

So, now Amazon.com decides to deactivate my device on 10/7/16 so it can't get any books online.  Fine with me!  It's their money they're losing out on, not mine.  And for what?  Just so they can do and say whatever they want to and not do right by me?  I'm in dire straights, and they keep sending emails saying they want to take $80 from my card, instead of $40 twice and one payment of $20.  I've spent thousands of dollars with Amazon.com on various products over at least 10 years, and they dare treat people like this and make me out to be a liar about the whole thing?  I tell them if they were paying me by the hour, with all the hours, days, months I've spent trying to get them to do the right thing, the device would be paid for by now.  My time is money too!

Nobody is a consumer advocate for online businesses, and a company as large as Amazon.com thinks it can do whatever they want.  I think I've also written the FTC ... not sure ... but, they're another useless organization who does nothing about anything.  Companies are running rip-shod over consumers, and are being held accountable for NOTHING!  They're a monopoly, and there's almost no way around purchasing things online without going through Amazon.com.  I'm disgusted and definitely looking for other options to help with this.

Earlier this year I wanted to research a small subculture in India, when suddenly a popup appeared from Amazon telling me they could sell me both a book and DVD about the group.  I called, complained.  They adamantly refused to tell me how to get rid of Amazon's installation, told me to call Apple.

I have a nephew with cerebral palsy and need a new wheelchair for school. I ordered the chair on 8/9 with Amazon Prime expecting it to arrived on 8/11. It's now 8/15 and the kid still did not received the wheelchair for his school. This is his first day in a brand new school. He was so disappointed. Apparently the chair was sent to its final destination which is somewhere in Ohio and I live in Florida. The shipping address was correct on the order form. This is so frustrated and the kid is devastating. When we called to asked why the chair was sent elsewhere, we were hung up twice. Finally, we had a chance to talk to the supervisor and the answer was: we will look into it. At the end, the kid will be without a wheelchair for another 3-4 days.",1,“poor customer service”

Bait & Switch, Scam, how many people get their money held for no apparent reason. Amazon couldn't explain why they didnt accept the Gift Cards?? Also they said only one gift card had been approved and authorized, but actually all three cards were authorized and all funds transferred to their account!

377,"I'm not a huge Amazon shopper because their prices are generally higher than my other options but I always check.  I do have Prime and love using their music app.  I also like the movie and tv show apps and I even have a Fire Stick which is side loaded.  Customer service about order issues is great.  

As for shipping, I'm literate enough to understand that if something may not be in stock or that it may not be sorted into the warehouse yet and that there may be a delay and shipping times start when the packages ship.  If I am not a Prime member then I won't receive as fast of shipping because I can't get faster shipping than those who pay for the faster shipping option.  That would make no sense!  I know that a package isn't late until the expected delivery date has passed.  Amazon can shipping the day before the expected delivery date and still get it on time many times.  I know to double check the expected delivery date on the checkout screen as that will show me the date and if I choose to procede, that means I accept that day.  It does not mean I see the date but hope it arrives sooner and if it doesn't I throw a fit.  Also, this delivery date will tell me if a third party seller is in another country.  If the expected delivery date is a range of 2 weeks 3 weeks out, it is not in my country.

Amazon does have some add on only items.  These will only be able to be purchased with orders over $25 sold and fulfilled by Amazon.  It can include all add on only items.  These items aren't big sellers and cause losses by making them available to be a single item delivery.  Instead of increasing the price, they offer it as an add on item.  Would you drive 20 miles to the store to purchase a pack of gum?  Most add on only items have a list of other sellers on the right hand side.  These are either higher priced or have a shipping fee.  Sometimes the add on only item will ship by itself if it's in a different warehouse than the other items.  This doesn't make the add on only feature a waste.  That means the entire order made shipping and handling it not be a loss for them.

The rest of their customer service departments are not helpful.  Reports aren't taken seriously and often ignored.   They allow abuse in their forums and also allow some very nasty posts to be posted as well as bullying and public shaming while removing the dumbest of things.

There is a group of nasty, dirty, hateful old ladies and a some men that think these women are the fake photos they share who spend their entire day looking for reviews to make fun of.  They then share them on the forums so others can go look and downvote that reviewer.  They write nasty comments on the reviews and Amazon allows it.  People should not be afraid to write reviews.

Other forums are fool of the most disgusting posts with inappropriate language and subjects.  Amazon allows in even though it looks horrible on their behalf.  Is it that their reps don't understand English enough to know that eating poo isn't an appropriate topic.

Also, Amazon allows fake profiles that are attacking sellers and products for no good reason.  They write rude questions and reviews even though they don't own the products.  With heaps of evidence sent to them, they still let these nutjobs play on Amazon.

Lastly, Amazon is removing reviews and reviewing privileges of people they believe are violating their TOS but many people never violate their TOS and lose their reviews while people obviously violating their TOS and having been reported countless times are free to write their garbage reviews.

Amazon priorities are a total crapshoot.  After my Prime membership is up I am going to be cutting ties with Amazon because I won't be out anything.  I can get my items elsewhere with no problem.  They have gotten their priorities so out of whack lately and out sourcing their employees isn't helping them with these issues as they don't understand English when you contact them.",1,"“Shopping ok, forums are disgusting” "

I've exported my amazon purchases on my account and added them on excel and have spent like almost 10k dollars and you would think they would at least allow me to not have to pay 100 for this joke service on top of that. i do not recommend prime to anyone. if u are looking for 2 day shipping its not here. they do not care if u get it in 2 days or not and frequently u wont. could be 5 business days like mine took.",1,“Amazon/Prime steadily getting worse over the years”

My problem, the fake reviews, so called vine program, and tons of fake ass nonsense Amazon has going on. I got an email from at least one honest person at Amazon referring to""testing"" certain accounts and voting features of ""certain accounts"". Which was part of my complaint. 

Then after all of this started they started deleting some of my reviews without even telling me! Not letting me edit my reviews. Things got completely stupid with how they were manipulating my account, and maintained the ENTIRE time they were not.

385,"I am a Prime Amazon Member. I ordered a new $1300.00 TV that I found on Amazon which was promised to be delivered ""next day"" on July 6, 2016. The date was updated to July 7, 2016 online when I checked the status online. I called and was told that it would definitely be delivered on July 7th and that Amazon would refund my next day shipping. I waited all day on July 7th for the TV. The TV never arrived. I went online and it said that it was coming by MAIL and that it was in transit! I called Amazon and asked how in the world could they guarantee ANYTHING sent by MAIL to be delivered the following day...and how could they send something so expensive and fragile BY MAIL? They had no answer. The agent put me on hold and said that she would call the USPS about the delivery. She came back online and said that she had spoken with the USPS and had been told it would be delivered by 3:00 p.m. She told me that she would call me back at 4:00 p.m. to confirm the delivery. At 4:20 p.m., I had no TV and no call from Amazon. So, I called Amazon. All the agent could tell me was that, in checking his tracking information, he could see the TV was ""in transit."" I told him that I KNEW that much as I could see it when I looked myself. He told me at that point that the TV would ""probably come tomorrow or the next day."" I told him that I had reserved a man to come out to mount my TV based upon Amazon's ""guarantee"" and all he could say was, ""I'm sorry. I know you are frustrated."" At that point I told him to cancel the order and I would go to Best Buy and get the TV there for the same price. He told me that he canceled the order. I also told him to cancel my Prime Membership as well. I am done with Amazon and their delivery ""guarantee"" days which, obviously, mean nothing at all. 

UPDATE: The Amazon Representative did not cancel the orde and it arrived the next day by mail carrier. I refused the delivery as I had already purchased the same TV from Best Buy the night before. The ironic thing about that was when the mailed TV arrived, the guy was at my home mounting the one I had bought at Best Buy! I'm still waiting for my refund from Amazon on my credit card of over $1300.00 and filed a dispute with AMEX just in case. Amazon says it can take up to two weeks to get the money refunded as returning the TV can take that long to get to them. They did give me $100.00 on my AMEX as a ""goodwill"" gesture for all the issues with this order. The Amazon representative also did not cancel my Prime as I had asked them to do.

A.

The ""free shipping"" now is also obfuscated: It used to be at the top, now is in with ""Free Shipping! - (if you get our credit card)"". ""Amazon Pantry"" as well--what is that? Complicated.

410,"Since January of 2014 to date, March 2016, we have placed 207 orders with Amazon.  It has been, until now, an extraordinarily good experience.  We have a great deal of respect for Mr. Bezos and what he has done.  This particular experience, however, was awful!  I thought that, since we had faired so well, maybe a larger item would work too; so, we ordered this Samsung dishwasher with installation and removal of the old washer.  Words fail me.  I had planned to aggregate all of the failures and miscommunications of this transaction like some prosecutor in a courtroom for others to read, but I am tired of thinking of it.  So, here goes with an unstudied, less calculated recap:  from the inception of the order we received multiple e-mailed correspondence as to the delivery of the product and the delivery of the ordered installation from at least four disparate sources.  There have been at least six different business entities and Amazon agents involved in the entire process: (i) Plessers, whoever that is; (ii) AM Home Installation, or something like that; (iii) Amazon, of course, who by the way disavow any responsibility once the money has changed hands, choosing rather to turn both the work and all appeals for help over to various other amorphous agencies; (iv) Nathan at 800.344.4856  I have no idea how I came to be in touch with him, but at least to his credit he revealed surprise at how the order had aged; (v) some man from New York named Miguel Santos, who reluctantly later identified his agency as Infinite Installations and himself as customer service agent for Amazon, that I talked to with no good outcome (At one point, Mr. Santos sent me an e-mail with an Amazon telephone number to call for customer service; it turned out to be a non-working number); and not least (vi) the named agent now representing Amazon for the claim.  From the beginning delivery was promised in the e-mails, but the installation dates supplied by each mail preceded the delivery date stipulated in the respective communication!  In an e-mailed response, I asked how you could install a product not yet delivered, but never got an answer to that or any other question.  With each mail, the delivery-install dates kept changing, each time with an install date which post-dated the delivery date!  Finally, this AM company arrived 5 hours beyond the promised four hour window.  I let the guy come into my home with the machine.  He was clearly harried and seemed uncertain of himself.  He brought the new machine into my home, banging our custom front door as he entered.  When the subject of removal of the old dishwasher came up, the guy said they were not responsible for removal of the old washer.  NOTE:  THIS WAS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE AGREEMENT WE ENTERED WITH AMAZON!  I then refused delivery and asked him to leave our home.  At first he wouldnt leave.  I insisted that he go.  Miserable experience!  The left hand seemed not to know that the right hand even existed, much less what it was doing.

They have now charged us $600 and left us to deal with another third party for ostensible resolution, bringing the total of different involved parties to at least six.  To anyone who might say to us that we should have known better, this is Amazon, we would say, you are absolutely right.  We should have known better.  We know now.  Small purchases have been great for us, and we will continue to buy these items; we will avoid complex buys in the future, however simply they are presented.

P.S.
I was interested in seeing what kind of response we might get from other Amazon customers.  In the main, I agree with what I have read:  for small items, Amazon is great!  Could not agree more fully.  Thus far, however, no one has shared an experience substantially similar to ours that went well for them.  Buying a $1200 dishwasher and having it installed in your home is not like buying a small commodity.  Our experience was confusing and very disappointing.  Amazon did not act as a third party overseeing the process to ensure good service.  This is simply not true.

P.S. (160407)
We have the final disposition of this matter.  We originally paid Amazon $1,131.00; of that amount Amazon returned to us $1,083.40, keeping $226.20.

Before finding SiteJabber and making this post, I tried to first post this review on Amazon. Someone who did not identify themselves denied the review; their only comment lay in the following excerpt with quotation marks outlying:   ""We have a great deal of respect for Mr. Bezos and what he has done.""  The intimation from this censor(s) seemed to be, we only accept complimentary reviews, seemingly suggesting that it would be ok for me to say nice things about them.  That response set me on this quest.",1,“PURCHASE REVIEW:  DISHWASHER WITH INSTALLATION” 
411,"Long story short all I wanted was my complete order or my complete money back.
When I called in I asked to have my total order cancelled or my whole order processed as they had order total on hold with bank, part of my order was being declined because they tried to re-authorize on top of the order total already on hold. I was assured my order was cancelled, then I noticed the hold was still on my account, I called again and was told my order shipped. They cancelled part of my order, not the whole, and was able to take the partial order funds out of the whole amt on hold (yet they didn't have access to the authorization like they claimed). I would've been happy if 
1. I was told the truth
2. My claim as a long time consumer was actually looked into instead of saying that's the bank problem not amazon.
 Simple. Now I'm stuck with needing to order from amazon as they have the easiest access to products I like, and not wanting to give them any more $. As long as I make simple orders, I think it'll be ok......Never want to call in ever again.",1,“Worst Customer Service Ever!!!!!!” 
412,"I ordered an Apple iphone 4s on the Apple website. To my greatest surprise, the phone was not locked and I had to pay $50 to unlock the phone as Amazon.com customer service were not helpful in resolving my claim. Also, the merchant posted wrong product description as I later found out that the product I received was not T-Mobile as seen on the sim that came with the phone.

I was very disappointed that Apple gave a very silly excuse and could not issue me a partial refund. I have been paying for Amazon.com for more than 5 years and I started blogging negative reviews for Amazon.com to all my contacts and would never use them again until I am refunded for the phone.",1,“Received a locked GSM phone instead of Unlocked GSM phone and Apple did nothing about my refund.” 
413,Last night after spending more than hour selecting songs to purchase them for run the site kicked me out with explanation that I am not eligible for that transfer. This is the second time I am having an account with Amazon and second great disappointment.

And of course to make things worse Amazon.ca does not provide the same service.,1,“This site sucks!” 
414,"Amazon does get traffic but surely dont use them as your only channel.  Theres been horror stories from large sellers.  Amazon has a flawed process in place for follow up if you do get kicked off as a seller.  So you fill out all this paperwork then they still turn you down to be a seller again.  When I was on a buyer could open up a case for say a defective product, but he opened up 3 cases for the same product and got me kicked off because it made my defect numbers too high,  So if your an Amazon seller be very careful not to make them your only distribution channel as if and when they kick you off  they wont even answer your messages.  To add insult to injury then they hold your money owed to you hostage for at least a month to 6 weeks before they will release it. I say avoid Amazon  as they compete against their sellers as well. Did you know you cannot leave feedback for Amazon the company when you buy something direct from them?  Its no surprise because they dont want you leaving them bad feedback, sounds like a double standard to me.",1,“Amazon kicks you off then bans family members at same address”

420,"Twice I've received used merchandise (directly) from Amazon.com, when it was supposed to be new. In a recent case, Amazon sent a used, defective backup camera system for Recreational Vehicle (RV), then replaced it with a 2nd defective unit. The instructions were useless. I cobbled together one working unit and returned the non-working parts. I installed the unit on my RV, which involved drilling holes in the body. Then I discovered that the camera had a condensation problem that arose whenever the camera was on for more than 15 seconds. I tried to contact the company (Ducooler and Xie Ju Ming) but their website was inactive. You can type them a support email, but you can never send it :-(   . Amazon agreed to take back the 2nd unit. When I sent it to Amazon, they charged me a $15.20 ""restocking fee"".   This is blatant fraud, as the unit was defective. Clearly Amazon intends to send it to yet another victim. Perhaps they hope that someone will pay for it, be confused by it, and not return it. Fraud, Fraud, Fraud.   I replied to the Amazon email telling me that they were ""restocking"" it, but it bounced. Their email wasn't even signed by a person. I disputed the insufficient refund with the credit card company and have no doubt that the dispute will stick, given the circumstances. Huge amount of time spent; some phone calls over 1 hour. Many emails sent.  Bottom line is: Avoid Amazon.com, and if you do receive used merchandise instead of new merchandise, return it immediately. Don't waste time trying to make it work....chances are that it has already been returned by someone else.",1,“amazon shipping used merchandise as new”

The first 2 laptops were defective out of the box, I received the last one without an activated windows 10 operating system! And to add insult to injury, I had to wait over 2 weeks for refunds and I'm still waiting for my $803.09 refund for the last return.

Over the last year, however, I have become very disappointed with the site.  I spent hours Christmas shopping trying to find items that would fulfill a $25 credit for a ""gift"" item that my daughter really wanted.  The qualifying items were considerably more expensive than other sellers had them for, and I ended up spending a lot more than I wanted and I ended up with a DVD that will not play on US players.  Just recently, I tried to sell a few things on amazon.  I couldn't log into my seller account and had to sign up for a professional account which costs $39 a month.  I didn't know I could sign up for an individual account and sell my items that way.  Long story short, I HAD to deactivate my account because I didn't have the correct tax or business info to have a professional account.  Now I can't sell on amazon again unless I create a new account.  I can't even cancel/terminate my existing account without contacting customer service.  I can't even find the number to contact them to do so.  The whole website has become so user unfriendly and not worth my time to continue to shop through them.  I never liked ebay, but I'm thinking I will switch back to shopping there because amazon has just gotten too greedy and doesn't really care about consumer needs anymore.",1,“Used to be a great site.... not anymore” 
430,"That is the Amazon site where usually they sell the used goods. Based on my experience they seem to turnaround returned goods (which may have been returned for being defective another reason to avoid buying from there) and resell them without checking them out first. 

I bought a Asus Flip chromebook, used like new (just described the condition of the box claiming it was unopened) but right after I took it out of the box the computer acted strangely. It was scroll, font would change size, picture would shake without  me even touching it!!  I started a return request stating that it was defective and gave all the above reasons and stated that it was like it was possessed and I was afraid of it!  

I usually don't check my invoices just expecting them to get it right on the refund, but for some reason I DID check and saw that they charged me the return shipping and changed the reason for return from defective product (where customer does NOT get charged for the return)  to buyer wanted to return reason (where you DO get charged.)  I immediately notified Amazon and they refunded the charges but even though you can see how many stars the ""warehouse' gets you can NOT read the reviews at to why, you click onto that it just brings you to an Amazon fact page unlike the private sellers where you can read what the customers say about them and AW's rating is NOT high, 84%.  The only review that you can see me write was about the product itself, so I would advise NOT EVER to buy ANYthing from Amazon Warehouse, if you buy it used, buy from private seller.",1,“Beware of buying from Amazon Warehouse...” 
431,"I've enjoyed many years of great service with Amazon. The few minor problems I've encountered through the years were solved fast and efficiently by their Customer Support Team. Free standard shipping during this time was 5 to 7 days. It seems that with the introduction of ""Prime"" free standard shipping now takes 7 to 12 days. The last three items I've ordered took the proverbial slow boat to Missouri. One package took 5 days to get from Texas to Missouri. Then while tracking the package it was delayed for 5 days at a facility close to me. A helpful Amazon Rep had it delivered the next day. Ink for my printer has taken 7 days to get halfway from California to Missouri! I could walk faster than that! My impression is that those of us that use free shipping will be penalized.

I ordered this item 2 weeks ago, and hopes to receive it before christmas in order to gift wrap it. I just found out today at 6am EST that AMAZON cancelled the order due to product availability. I called customer service to request why it was available 2 weeks ago and why I'm just now finding out about this being cancelled. The SUPERVISOR said sorry the orders are based on priority and told me to reorder it through another seller, and hope that I receive it by Christmas, after I explained this was not an issue she stated she attempted to call a 3rd party vendor to get one directly shipped to me. But all she really did was disconnect the phone after an hour and 20 mins waiting with multiple hold times. This was shocking to have happen, but even more shocking is that when I called right back I was just told that I could reorder it and get a gift card. As this is their issue I feel like they need to reorder it at no cost to me and send it next day. The resolution was to close my account with amazon. This was the most poor customer service I have ever received. I will no longer do business AMAZON. Amazon is horrible at resolving in customers favor, even when they know that they are dead wrong.

463,"Ukrainian Viacheslav Gudin (Vyacheslav Gudin), who trades at Amazon.com as BUYUA and at eBay as NATALYOK2009, is in fact an anti-Semite with links to neo-Nazis in Ukraine.

Gudin's seller accounts at http://stores.ebay.com/natalyonlineua/ and http://www.amazon.com/s?marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER&me=A3UHK45JZQN329&merchant=A3UHK45JZQN329&redirect=true stock items looted from businesses bombed and shelled by pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. Funds from his ill-gotten gains enable self-styled academic Vyacheslav Gudin to organize activities such as ultra right-wing meetings in Ukraine. At one of these, he is on record as having made a ridiculous false accusation that Israel harvested organs from orphaned Ukrainian children. (http://honestreporting.com/stop-the-spread-of-the-swedish-blood-libel-2/)

At eBay and Amazon Viacheslav uses the alias Ievgen Gudin. At eBay he makes it appear he is a woman by employing the seller ID natalyok2009 and displaying photos of women as part of the seller profile. But the giveaway is the name and address linked to the accounts:

Viacheslav Gudin
81A Kremlevskaya str, 91

To add to the confusion, the seller email address is johnzp90@gmail.com. I

First time I contacted Amazon they said I could order another one and they would send me a return label so I could return the first book for a full refund.  Liars!  Got an email saying their ""A to Z Guarantee Team"" had decided that I waited too long (more than 2 weeks) to claim the book was defective.  So it's my fault that the book took 5 weeks to fall apart instead of 2??  Appealed their decision, was turned down again.  They put a block on my emails asking for reconsideration!

They did not call in over 25 HOURS despite feedback I would get a call within 1 minute.  They later refused to allow me to add a gift to someone's wish list and send it to them.  My crime was wanting to send a Teddy Bear.

I had spent hours on Amazon's site trying to add and then order a gift for an online friend who's address is known to Amazon via their wish list, in fact I had already ordered one item that was delivered so I couldn't understand why I could not get their site to work a second time.

When I finally spoke to someone in customer service from the ""wish list"" department I was told that I can not add something to someone's wish list and send it to them.  If that is the case, why do they even allow consumers to add ""gift ideas"" to the friend's wish list profile if you can't buy them?

They told me it was because the recipient might want to return the gift, but I'm the customer, not the gift recipient.  It's my money and I am buying a gift, not an item the recipient can return and get money in return.

The only rationale I can think of is due to sending inappropriate gifts, however I was trying to send a Teddy Bear for a friend, to help in a trying time.  Amazon's employee had ZERO interest in trying to understand.  Stupid policy is what we have so we're going to follow it.  That should be their Slogan.

I also sometimes have to rely on online shopping like Amazon because I am still recovering from cancer, and am not always able to jump in the car and drive a half hour to a major chain store to get what I need. So when I tried the new Prime Pantry I had high expectations of what it's quality would be, and was hopeful in it being a good resource for me. I ordered items that were canned and items in boxes, that I would normally buy in the grocery store, and thought I was getting a deal with such a decent price, but when I received my box of items I was really disappointed. First of all, the cans were almost all dented. Not normally a big deal, but there was never any mention of denting on the site, and Amazon is usually particular about making an honest accounting of the condition of items. The cans were packed loosely into the box with the boxes of food and pasta so they caused plenty of damage while getting bounced around by the postal service. The shipping box was split into 2 sides, but the cans were scattered so there were several on both sides so NONE of the boxed food was safe from damage. Some items were so damaged that they were leaking, and had to be thrown out. Since the service, Prime Pantry, shows you how full a box is when you are ordering, I was confused why there was so much looseness in the shipping box, when the service said the box was 99% full, when I ordered. I have alerted them to my disappointment, and they refunded my money in full. However, this service is not one that I am eager to give another try. I told Amazon that I would rather shop at the grocery store, and spend extra money, than use this service again and roll the dice on what I may have to throw out from damage. I do not want to go through this every time I get a box from them that is packed like the people working there are living brain donors.

I contacted Amazon's Customer Service department shortly after 8pm Saturday evening. I spoke with a first line representative, a supervisor and manager to explain that my shipments never arrived which were gifts for my niece's birthday party on Saturday.

All 3 Amazon representatives told me that the delivery date and time were estimates, and that the items would arrive on Monday, April 20.

I was deployed for active military duty-and upon my return- I attempted to buy a frame.
I was now told that any frame I bought-would require a wooden plywood-to be placed between the frame and mattress- to ensure the warranty- and not injure the sleeper. I contacted Amazon- and after they read the advertisement- we filed an A-Z Complaint. I never heard from anyone- besides my refund was denied. Meanwhile I spoke to Sleep Well-and under the circumstances they were sending me a replacement mattress. Amazon wrote me a thank you letter- and was sending it up via Corporate- because any frame sold by Amazon-made by Olee-Zanus etc- approximately 100 frames- are all falsely advertised- and all require that plywood board to be paced on the frame- this is no-where mentioned in any of their ads- so all 100 advertisements for these frames would have to be revised.
Meanwhile A-Z without talking to me about anything denied my claim- even though Sleep Well was willing to replace the damaged mattress. At no charge.
I asked Amazon to compensate me-for all the time-aggravation-and work that I performed- that permitted their organization to send this information up the ladder to Corporate-so that all these bed frames would have to be revised and corrected.
I asked for compensation-for all my time and work- in the form of a metal frame-that holds a box spring- as to ensure the 10 year warranty of the mattress.

Amazon only gives you free shipping if you spend over $35.00. In my book that makes them yet another Corporate giant trying to get more out of you, then you should have to pay.  

There are better deals on E-Bay then these rip off artists are trying to scam you with.

They are sneaky!

My wife ordered a vest for me on their website. There was no mention that this vest was coming from China until after you place your order.

When you sell a product you ought to have someone there that can answer questions on what the products limits are. I called amazon before I purchased this unit and the person could tell my absolutely nothing on what the product could do. Explained to the person what I was going to use the product for and they said it would do just fine. I also called the manufacturer to see what they said about it too and was told the very same thing. After I had 2 units both of them damaged and had to be repaired by me to make it look decent. Took me probably 2 hours to straighten the sleeves on the units. Without any compensation whatsoever for doing it. I could have called the service center and had them come out and fix it I guess but of course the nearest one is 4 hours away and that would have cost you guys a bunch of money but I fixed them myself.
The worst thing about this whole deal is I bought the unit for a new building and there was a hole cut in my wall to fit this unit. Now when I find out the unit isn't anything close to what I need to do the job I wanted it to.
I have a hole in my wall where a different product will not fit. So I have to have the contractor of the building to come out and replace a bunch of wains coating and insulation. This was not free so I not only did all the repairs on the unit taking it in and out of the building several times I had to get my building fixed. 
And then the returning of the product was another thing. You advertise this unit as being 150 lbs. and it was 195 lbs so UPS wouldn't ship it back to you. I got the first one all packaged up and they picked it up.
The next day it was sitting on my front porch on it's top. I couldn't even get out of my door since the unit was placed in front of my door. So being 63 and having to try and move this 195 lbs package off my porch was another interesting undertaking. So had to go buy some 2x4's and build a ramp to get the package up and my truck. So there was another expense. The 2nd one was the same way, you sent a tag from UPS, they picked it up and brought it back the next day. 
I hope all your customers aren't treated this way or your company will go the way of your first phone a failure. If I can post this message on your website I surely will because this is totally an unacceptable way to do business in my opinion. 
I also very mad at all the run around I have been getting on getting the refund. Was told the first time the credit you gave me for the bent up sleeve was compensation for the work done on the unit and the full price would be credited back to me if I didn't want to exchange it but that was another fib I guess because it sure wasn't. 
I'm sure no one will read this unless I can post it on Amazon's website someplace or somewhere I can give you a rating on your business. 

Thanks for nothing, thanks for all the run around and thanks for all my added expense to get heat in my building.

520,"Even if you can put aside the horrible treatment of Amazon employees, even if you can overlook the fact that Amazon is killing brick and mortar (along with all those retail jobs), this company is still horrible. There customer service is a joke. Fraud runs rampant now. I'm a savvy shopper and still got scammed twice in the last few months. 

First ordered a Nintendo Switch was charged and received a tracking number that never moved. It took Amazon far too long to refund the obvious scam. Second time I got a fake 200 GB SanDisk micro SD card. It looked like a legit 200 GB card, but was just blank plastic on the backside and was actually only an 8 GB card. Again Amazon was slow to refund and amazingly didn't even close down the scam sellers account.

I then received an Amazon gift card as a gift from my aunt that had a zero balance on it when I tried to use it. Amazons response was basically too bad so sad. They said, ""It appears someone other than the intended recipient used the gift card. We cannot offer a refund."" Gee that's nice, and when I asked who used the card they said that info is private. They admit the card was fraudulently used, but then hide who did it and do no further investigation. No wonder scams run rampant on Amazon, their rules literally promote scammers.

That was the final straw, I cancelled a huge Christmas order I had placed as well as my Prime membership. The funny thing is Amazon actually isn't always the cheapest, they've just brainwashed us all into thinking it. 

I ended up becoming a Gamers Club Member at Best Buy and reordered all the Christmas stuff even cheaper than it was from Amazon and felt good supporting a brick and mortar store and the sales associates who depend on that job.

Amazon is a horrible company that is getting so big they believe they don't have to care about anyone. Stop supporting this company, or in the future we will all be forced to work for Amazon and buy from Amazon, as they will have fulfilled their evil plan and put all brick and mortar stores out of business.",1,“Evil as they come”

523,"Why don't see your Amazon many illegal business operations and human right violations???

I need this answer. You treat others illegally,and then again do this same law violations to me. 

I will let every one know what you Amazon does law violations. Why don't focus on improving your sale stuff quality, but screw a customer, and beat it harshly and rudely???

Your rudeness and illegality will finally punish your own business. I don't know who is your name. If you have any humanity and morality, please leave this wrongful sale company and find a good company to get a bright future.

I already check with lawyers. Your closure of my account violated the law. Your own illegal policy should be erased without delay.

Your store has only 30 days return. Your store should keep its return without reserve. I always do return legally, without any way to like your Amazon does always in law violations followed by many lawsuits.

Amazon has return policy, you should fulfill it. If you can't fulfill it without reserve and can't afford returns, you can close your business; and stop deceiving us customers from telling them your return policy, but don't keep it.

As I restate it again. I never do anything wrong,  I just do any return legally and follow the law. If your Amazon can't offer returns to customers, you can close your business immediately. I believer there are lots and lots of business operators and online stores can do this very well without rudeness and illegality like Amazon always does.

If you don't want me to return your garbage and defective quality products, you can notice that I can't return them beforehand. So I will not return them, and throw these garbage away and destroy them. 

But you can't close my account after I follow legal procedures to return bad quality garbages. This is illegal, rude and bestial!!! 

As I said again, if you can't afford return, why you deceive me to joint Amazon prime membership???

If you don't want to fulfill your return policy, why you allow me to return garbage, and then close my account???? This is illegal!!!

If you don't want me to return garbage, you can tell me; I will throw them away without return.

But you should never treat any customer like this: you allow their return, but you close their accounts. They do everything legally, but you treat legal customers illegally and rudely.

As I say it again, you should reopen my account. I want my account reopen is not because I want to further buy anything from Amazon, but it's for justice and rights!!!

Your sale company Amazon, a buy-sell online company has this rude and immoral and illegal policy; what you should do humanly is to correct that old and illegal policy; but not allow it to hurt more and more  people. I see online many customers account was closed. We will together fight for justice and rights.

You should stand on the right side, and do everything legally. If you don't allow a customer return, you can stop that; and put your non-return policy on the product page; if you want to have it, you should fulfill return policy all the time without discrimination and inequality. 

As a legal customer, please reopen my account. Don't do illegally and wrongfully again and again to people. If you don't want to obey the law and fulfill your promise in US, please close your online store and go somewhere like North Korea to do whatever you want to customers; but never do illegally in US. Lawyers have their ways to punish and put sale stores on the right track, and uphold customers rights.

Say it again, Amazon has 30 days return policy, it must fulfill it; if a sale store Amazon can't fulfill it, you can say non-return policy in your virtual non- physical website. But you never do this to customers: allow return, but close their accounts and force them shut down. This is not any customer's fault; they return garbage stuff, because Amazon has return policy and also lots and lots of defective and bad quality stuff full of Amazon. No one want to waste their time on any return, if not without any way to keep garbage stuff.

Like on Ebay, many sellers sell their stuff without return policy, people buy them also without return. But if any store has return policy, that store has to follow the rule and also the law to fulfill it. Don't treat customers like naive chicken.

You have this policy, you should fulfill it; you can't fulfill it, please say you don't have return policy; let customers choose it. You should not close any legal customers' account. I don't steal any credit cards, I don't return mis-presented stuff, I never claim non-lost stuff. All of my purchases and returns are completely legal, you don't have any way to close my account. As I said it again, if you don't want return, you can say it and stop it, but can't close any customer account. 

Only because of legal return, you Amazon close a customer account; it totally shows your Amazon does NOT respect and obey the law and business rules. This law violations will get punished and law sued. 

Please must reopen my account, for saving Amazon from badness and law violations, and for justice and human rights.

Each time, I contact Amazon, there is a real name for communication. But why always no name on this email, suspect what's wrong with your inside systems? 

Please put your NAME in the email. I must know who treated me like this illegally, who did destroy Amazon reputation and ruin Amazon with such illegal closure behavior!

As for $50 credit, it's not a promotion or something as you deceived, it's a compensation for a seller cheated me on Amazon for my money without any product sale. That seller cheating nearly damaged my daily life during those days. 

Why not improve your sale system and prevent seller's cheating, but focuses on a legal customer's return??? All my purchases and returns information are all my private information, why you record and track all my private information??? You Amazon want to sell them for another money, like lawsuits were under way against this anti-human rights????

You should focus on product quality and seller's quality, this is the best way to get Amazon cash and competitive to other many stores; but never put any finger on any legal customers who always follow Amazon's return policy and obey the law. 

You put your finger on a legal customer, please move away your illegal finger, and treat a customer legally! 

If your Amazon's fault to allow return, but not customer's fault. Any return is just followed within 30 days return range. All returns are legal!

If your Amazon can't afford customer return, please stop return policy and say it in your still running website. 

But never do this again: you have return policy, but don't fulfill them. 

It's your Amazon's fault, not mine. Please reopen my account, correct Amazon's illegal behavior.",1,“Why don't see your Amazon many illegal business operations.....”

The only step to proceed from that page was to place the order, and the items that I had select as 0 quantity where ordered. Immediately afterwards I cancelled the order! And received confirmation of the cancelation, but still the order was placed. So now even if I cancel my order I still have to pay shipping.

I bought this as a Christmas present for my fiance who likes modern furniture. I received the item and upon unpacking it, it seemed as though it had already been unpacked. The box was tattered and the packing tape had been retaped. Once I opened the product, I inspected it and found the underside fabric was torn where there was a piece of the wood frame supporting the center. It was not a large tear but it was a tear never-the-less. I decided that it was likely a used product sent by mistake so I repacked it immediately. Given that Christmas was a few days away, I went to a local furniture shop and found something similar to buy in time for Christmas.

I bought the product because it was on Amazon so I felt comfortable. I do understand Amazon uses 3rd party sellers and the return policy for this seller seemed straight-forward: if the product is damaged, they buyer can return it for a full refund. The seller has been trying to get the 15% restocking fee from the beginning of my communication with them. I dont think I should have to pay $100+ to them because they sent me a used product by mistake. They are claiming that there is no tear on the bottom fabric but that is absolutely not true and I am surprised they would blatantly lie like that. They have even sent me photos they took upon return of the product and the tear is shown (again, it is not big, but it is there and it is something I would consider as damage and would buy off a classified bulletin board).

At this point, I have requested them to refund me 100% of what I paid and I have disputed the charge through my credit card issuing bank. Stores123 have not replied to me with any message indicating they will provide me a 100% refund. They have offered to send me the product back (which I clearly do not want) or to pay a 15% restocking fee. I really feel extorted here as they are in clear violation of their return policy.",1,“Dont buy from Amazon seller Stores123”

Amazon knew this, had Post Office Delivery proof, and only sent protected e-mails to the seller. When this didn't work, Amazon refused to help me. 

On my own I had to find out Sellers address and phone number and contact them. They claimed I wasn't in their system at all and never heard of the company that shipped it.

After the first call this morning (November 3rd) I called Amazon back to ensure this wasn't a spoof of some sort (seeing as the number was 5 digits). After talking to Amazon the first time, I was told that the reason I owe money was that I did not have the funds needs to pay for the iPod when they tried to charge me yesterday (November 2nd). I was also told that they had contacted my bank-which, after a talk with my bank, they didn't do-to ensure I had the funds needed at the time of ordering (October 20). After the explantion of Amazon's poor charging times, I was told to contact the collection agency to talk to them.

So I did. I couldn't get in touch with them [the collection agency] so I called my bank for suggestions on my next step. I was told to call Amazon back, which I did. After having to explain to them [Amazon] what I was told earlier, I was contacted to a three way call with myself, the Amazon rep, and a rep from the collection agency. The agency was rather gruff with me, but I was rather pissed, and was trying to get a simple answer out of the Amazon rep who was still on the line: why did you send me an iPod without being paid(To me, this seems like a horrible business trait)? Instead of an answer to that, I was told that my account number (since I ""paid"" for the iPod directly from my bank account) must have been typed wrong. To which I asked why Amazon didn't tell me at the moment of this realization on their part.

And when I had a problem with a merchant who overcharged me (some sort of clerical error on THEIR part) over 8 times what I was quoted to pay it took me nearly 3 months to clear it up. There is no phone number to call and talk to a live human being and I had to send email after email to try to clear it up. It was ridiculous. 

But let's focus on their book review section for a moment: I really hated a book and gave it one star. The author harassed me using various aliases and, then worst of all, got Amazon.com to pull me one star review AND I was accused of hectoring this author. All because this one little crybaby (named Paul Cohn...look it up...I kid you not) complained. And what I found especially fascinating about this particular author is that besides writing total crap ""novels"" he attacked everyone who gave his book anything less than 5 stars and ALL of his 5 star reviews were from ""people"" who had never written another book review in their LIFE! I mean... it wasn't a best seller... it maybe sold 20 or 30 copies and it has about 10 5 star reviews that these reviewers have NEVER written another single book review. 

I mean, if that doesn't reek or sound of fish, I don't know what does. And Amazon comes down on me??? well, that's just crazy.

I had always sold strictly on Ebay.com for 4 years now and have always been happy with my experience there. So last week I decided I would try selling on Amazon. I set up my seller account, listed 5 items for sale and figured that would be it. I'd check it every day to see if any of my items sold. The next day I checked it and to my surprise, Amazon stated that they had suspended my account because of policy violations. Upon further inspection I found out that they had suspended my account because they had linked my account to another suspended seller account. I thought this must be a mistake as I don't have nor have I ever had another amazon account. Nor does anyone living in my household, ie my girlfriend. After emailing amazon and explaining this I received a form generated email back from them stating that while they could not share any info on how they relate accounts or what account I am supposedly related to they had significant proof that I was linked to another account. After many emails I finally called there customer service and was told in exact words, there was nothing they could do to help me. I asked if there was a superior I could talk to or anyone who could help me and was told no, that department does not respond by phone. At this point I was getting very frustrated, and after a few more emails back and forth, with every single amazon response being another form generated email, I finally contacted the better business bureau. Well, alot of good that did. Amazon gave them the same bulls&*t response they gave me. So I asked, if someone is using my name, bank account etc, shouldn't they tell me what this so called account is I am linked to so I can put a stop to. Well, Amazon does not give any info on how they link accounts, I'm just supposed to take there word for it that I am linked to another account. Finally I contacted amazon to close any and all accounts related to my name and after probably 10 emails and 4 or 5 more phone calls, all just to get my damn account closed, because I WILL NEVER, EVER , EVER shop their crap website again, I finally managed to get my account closed for good.

I have sold on Ebay for 4 years now and have a 99.7 percent rating on there, and have never encountered anything like this at all. If I have to call Ebay, I am always able to talk to a live person who usually can solve my problem in a matter of minutes. Amazon has poor customer service at best. AT BEST! I am not the only one with complaints like these either, google AMAZON SUCKS and look at all the pages.

552,"Amazon is not the first website that I would order an item from. Amazon has a tendency to deliver packages days after it was scheduled for delivery .Sometimes they don't even ship your package until the day that it was supposed to be delivered to you. If it's an important item that you drastically need in a hurry I suggest shopping somewhere else. They are sometimes very unreliable, their customer service can use some improvement, and their delivery times are usually unpredictable to say the least. 

I ordered lights to decorate my dorm room off of amazon and I never received my order from them. When I first ordered it they told me that it would come within 4 to 5 business days: however, that was not the case. My lights did not ship until the 4th day of me waiting for them. I waited a couple days to see if my package would come. After about three days of not receiving my ""shipped"" package I decided that it was time to take matters into my own hands. I first called the delivery company that was supposed to drop off my package and they said that they never got a package for my address or name. I then decided to email amazon and they replied back saying that my item was shipped to the postal service that would be delivering it. Although, they said that my items were shipped I still did not receive them days later so I decided to call the company to and find out why. 
The first time I gave them a call I was on hold for at least 30 minutes waiting to talk to a representative. After being on hold for a significant amount of time, I was told that there were no available representatives to talk to at that time and that I should call the next day. The next day when I called I was on hold for a while but I finally got to talk to someone about my order. I was told that my order had been sent back because of an unknown error. I never got an email or notification saying that the order that I have been waiting on for weeks was sent back. When I asked why my order got sent back the representative told me that she was not sure why but sometimes it just happens. When I asked for my money she told me that I had to email amazon or go to the website and click on ""about refunds"" and ask back for my money there. So I emailed amazon and asked them for a refund due to the fact that my package got canceled but I never got my money back. The next day they emailed me and said they would refund me my money back within 24 hours of my initial email. I waited for the money but it never went back into my account so I emailed them again and this time they didn't respond until days later saying that, once again, they would send my money back to me.
 After not receiving my money a second time I just decided not to worry about it and just decided to be cautious of where and what I buy online. Next time I know not to rely on Amazon so much for my online shopping. Next time I know to be cautious and what sites I shop on.

Yes your correct another indian this one claims to have a american name but the same result you have to ask them to repeat thereselves over and over.

They claim i wrote a product reveiw that i did not write and it was deleted do to bias. 3 ppl and 55 mins later nothing understandable.

Sellers on ebay virtually always ship out next day. So why a week stalling my orders, EVERY time? I can only conclude its to force customers using free shipping to join amazon prime. 
So I did. 
Or at least wanted to. 
I check the box for free 30 day membership and placed an order using my debit card.
A couple of hours later I get an email and it says my order cant be shipped because my debit card turned down the $100 prime membership fee. Huh? 
The terms and conditions of prime free trial clearly state that amazon charges you the $100 at the END of the 30 day trial. And thats if you want the year of prime. Guess they lied. I ordered  the same item from ebay. No problems.

Most of my supposed 2-day delivery orders never make it in two days, if I receive them at all (which then necessitates phone calls on my end to Amazon).  The delivery companies have even posted pictures of other people's houses and claim that our house is where they delivered our packages.  I've also received wrong merchandise that Amazon wanted ME to pay for to return!  The delivery services they use are THE WORST!!  Most of the time, our packages are either shoved into our mailbox or set beside it AT THE CURB, some of them getting soaked by the rain (I'm sorry that we live on a private drive, but for $99 per year for Prime, I expect better service).  But the worst situation was recently when, on Amazon's own website in the My Orders section, it was stated that a Prime Pantry order of mine (my first order with PP, by the way) had been delivered 8 DAYS BEFORE WE ACTUALLY RECEIVED IT!!  Not to mention that it had been placed, again, next to our mailbox, IN THE POURING RAIN!  A neighbor called and told us that she saw it.  The products inside that were in cardboard boxes were damp, but luckily nothing was ruined.  The first person with whom I spoke at Amazon had to transfer me to another department (after dealing with ANOTHER order of mine that had been claimed on Amazon was delivered, as well, but was not).  The second woman was VERY nice and said that Amazon is aware of all of the delivery problems and is working on it.  I did end-up getting the choice of a refund or another box of them same items delivered for free, as well as have my $7.99 shipping cost returned (yeah, that even made it worse - the fact that I had PAID almost $8 to have THIS kind of service >:-(  ).  It's interesting how the free box of items showed-up the next day on my doorstep :-/ .  Anymore, I try to find what I need on ANY other website and only go to Amazon for what I can't get anywhere else.  I really don't know how much longer we'll keep our Prime subscription.

575,"I really used to like Amazon, but a few recent experiences are making me reconsider my Prime membership, or doing much business with them at all. First, I had ordered some items for Christmas~ I ordered on December 18th, and they were due on the 20th. Then I get an e-mail saying the package would be delayed, and they were due on the 22nd. Christmas Eve morning, I contact them by chat and tell them I am hosting a holiday party in a few hours and still don't have the package. They again tell me that it is ""delayed"", that it is ""lost in transit"" but they assure that I will get the package by the end of the day (I did not), and they will refund the amount. I ask if I will still get the items if I am refunded, and that representative says that I will. Christmas morning, I contact them again and they say the package was lost, and that I need to reorder the items, but that negates the refund I was credited. I ask what they are going to do about the fact that my original package was never received, and the Christmas items we were waiting for will be arriving well after Christmas. They tell me that they will give me a credit of $5 to use towards my next order (then they say they will make it a $15 credit). However, we just recently placed an order, and I'm pretty sure they did not apply any credit to it.

The second issue is that they charged our daughter's student card (which she had registered under our account so she could get things she needs for school) for our Hulu subscription. I asked why her card was suddenly charged when it has always been charged to the same card. They tried to say that there was not sufficient funds on our card, so that is when they charged hers. I checked our account and there were enough funds in our account when they charged her card. I told them that they should have given us notice if there were insufficient funds instead of going ahead and using her card, and that they should refund the amount to her, which they said they were going to do. But today they send an e-mail saying they are not able to refund the amount to her card! I told them that is not acceptable, so we shall see what happens after this.

 I definitely notice a decline in their customer service from previous years. It used to be if there were any issues (which were rare), they were resolved quickly and with limited contact. Now I've had two negative experiences in less than a month of each other, I got bounced around between at least 5 different representatives last time, and the representatives try to placate you while telling you they cannot really help you (and it is not easy to understand what they are saying, the messages are in broken English).

When I did that they then said I had to order over $50 to get free shipping, and when I increased my order, again, this time to $53, at the check out they added $20 more to cover shipping.

We don't typically shop there anyway but were recently gifted an item from a prime member.  This experience has been a catastrophe from start to finish:

- First, the price jumped $9 from the time I found the item to the time they were ordered, which was about 24 hours.
- item arrived and sizing was completely off.
- This was a gift, yet I was told exchanges are not allowed unless the item is defective and you're exchanging for the EXACT same size, color, etc. So they would send a return label then send a gift card once the item was received.
- item shipped back quickly and the card was sent to my email...for the cheaper price of the item, NOT the price that was paid for it.
- I emailed customer service, who said ""well, send us the original order number and we'll look into it."" (Obviously I'd provided the original number when I requested the return. But, fine, I'll play their games. At this point I've already decided I won't be doing business with them ever again. I'm just trying to get through it to get my son his birthday gift!!)
- I did a customer service chat, and was told sure they'd send the remaining balance, although they had actually charged us (the gift recipient) for return shipping and subtracted it from the value of the gift!! Unbelievable.
- We just realized they sent the shipping fee to the original sender, so my son is still short $9 on the value of his gift. The prime member who sent the gift suggested we just send her the gift card number and she'll reorder the correct size. This is far too many hoops to jump through to send or receive a simple gift. We will not be doing business with them again.",2,“They've permanently lost my business” 
586,"Amazon used to be great, and was my go to site for ordering anything online. However in the last few times I ordered from them, my packages were delivered by ""flex drivers."" I live in a building with locked doors to the lobby that require a key to get in. In the past the mail people would just put my package in the mailbox or leave it by the door for me. But these flex drivers don't have keys and would ring my bell over and over and over and over. When I got downstairs some Joe Schmo off the street is holding my package, rudely shoving it at me and running away. The first time it happened I thought my package was sent to a neighbor across the street by mistake and he was pissed about it. He acted like I really inconvenienced him and pissed him off. But after 3 more incidents I did some research and realized that these random people are handling my packages, and every single one of them has been completely RUDE. Maybe it's just the area I live in, but not one of them has been polite and I don't appreciate being disturbed. I don't want strangers off the street handling my stuff and ringing my doorbell over and over again. I live on the 3rd floor, have a small child and work from home. It's not convenient or an enjoyable experience to order from Amazon anymore, which is a shame. I used to love Amazon prime but I will never resubscribe to it until they get rid of these flex drivers and only let professionals handle packages. And I haven't missed them at all. I can get the same stuff from ebay, often cheaper with free shipping without the hassle or subscription fee. Prime TV isn't worth it either. There's only a few shows and movies you can watch and they charge you for the good stuff. You have access to about 10 crappy kindle books that no one wants to read. Not worth the $99 bucks IMO.",2,“Flex drivers ruined it” 
587,"Amazon used to be my first choice when making a purchase online. Great selection, good prices and fast shipping. But that's all changing. Over the past year or so i have noticed that Prime shipping is no longer 2 days but mostly 3-4 plus packing is taking 1-4 days so a 2 day Prime shipment can turn into 7 days or more. The actual packing has become very bad, a recent delivery of books have been thrown in with tools or other items without any protection, resulting in a book that looks decidedly second hand before they have even been used. I never used to have to return items but this year about 15% of all my orders have arrived damaged. Prices used to be the best but with a little Google search I'm find better deals on other sites and now that Amazon has decided to start charging tax on all sales, other sites are looking so much more appealing.

Apparently, they won't accept it just because I spend less than $50 or I used the free prime membership.

If I need something desperately I will order through my Prime account and pay full over priced  for it but I have backed off ordering through Amazon because there are just too many wonderful online sites that offer the exact same products at betters prices and with free shipping if you search the Internet for free shipping coupons, or even just ask the retailer for a coupon telling them you will go to Amazon. There are also too many counterfeiters on Amazon and Amazon knows it and does nothing about it. eBay recently got outed and eBay will become a thing of the past. People are realizing that eBay is siding with crooked sellers and counterfeirs and selling out the customers. Amazon needs to clean up it's act and watch it's price points.

Customer service stated they did not need to ship it by a certain day and they only needed to be within the estimated time frame for delivery. Very slow shipping took 9 days to ship from 90 miles away. Amazon waited to the last day to ship and it was in stock. I guess you have to pay a $100 to get good service with prime account.

So I cancelled our order.  and over the next 50+ hrs  reviewed the posting and noticed. . . . 

! Within 20 hrs   Amazon dropped mention on the product posting that the product was sold and fulfilled by them, leaving pricier seller options . . . .

! But is still listed under their promo' units,  'amazon choice.... available to ship immediately'   catalog  for this product line-up.     { ehhh !? }

As a former Prime membership customer on Amazon I no longer see any reason to give Jeff Bezos or any of his affiliates or cronies anybody's money. I mean, the man is #1 richest in the world, unless one has a vested interest in displacing the Waltons as the #1 family in the world to hold the Walmart corporations and billions of USD, one should diligently practice the science of skinflintery. I heavily regret any dealings with anyone selling items on this website, and unless anonymous individuals known as 'Michael Deering' want to face me on the defamation lawsuit stand or queue up for a restraining order they should end Amazon's web service support. The warehouses in Amazon power 10,000 lb packing and shipping machines to fill and send the customer packages, to avoid liability and a potential lawsuit, so no one would be any the wiser if an individual's body were placed in a restraining device and thrown violently down the conveyor belt and buried offsite or cremated. Drones flying the skies carry 3,000 lbs. of Amazon merchandise across the skies and it is only a matter of time before they pick someone off or assert non-platonic connections of anyone that they perform surveillance on.

656,"I've been shopping on Amazon almost since their inception back in 1994.  My overall experience for the past 20-years has been great.  I've had a seller and a buyer account.  I've purchased hard to find items at very competitive prices.  Up until the past year I've had absolutely no issues.

Notably, over the past two-years Jeff Bezos has contracted outside of the USA (Amazon was a Seattle based company) and invested literally BILLIONS of dollars in India.  Wow!

Not only do I disagree with that (US companies should keep jobs in the US, this is totally selling out), but there's a reason labor is cheaper in India - it's of a lower quality.

This is my story.  I had signed up for the free 6-month Amazon Prime Student membership.  For some reason I forgot to cancel it after the 6-month trial and the $49 membership fee was deducted from my account (no pre-warning this was about to happen).  As I didn't want Prime membership I contacted Amazon and cancelled the Prime membership.  Two weeks later the same thing happened - another $49 deducted from my bank account for Prime membership.  Why?  I have no idea.  I didn't sign up for Prime again.  Not only could this have sent my bank account overdrawn but it was an unauthorized withdrawal of funds from my bank account.  Wow!  That's usually referred to as 'theft'.

I decided to close my Amazon account completely as I did not want to risk this happening again.  Now, if you ever want to close your Amazon account you will see that there are no less than 7-steps, plus an email verification process, and then a 24-hour wait with no confirmation email that your account has actually been closed.  The process is so convoluted it is literally designed to make closing your account extremely difficult.  What a low-ball tactic to keep you.  During the process I went online and 'chatted' with customer support.  The customer support person I spoke to (Guarab) had a very poor command of the English language and did not offer anything helpful at all.  Why would he?  He's on the other side of the planet and English is not his first language.

I did some research and sure enough (search it up yourself - I just used Wikipedia) between 2014 and 2016 Amazon invested over $5 BILLION DOLLARS in India!!!!  

Wow!!!  So, Jeff Bezos apparently isn't rich enough (despite his net worth of over $72 BILLION DOLLARS!!!) that he has to take jobs to India instead of investing here in America where he lives and where Amazon was birthed.  I despise companies that do that.  They're sell outs.  

I would have given Amazon a one star review but I'm actually trying to be fair.  They served me well for 20-years.  It's only been the past year that they've really let me down and, in my opinion, sold out.  

Ironically, Jeff Bezos money making strategy of investing in India (let's be honest - it's not because India is a beautiful country, it's exclusively because of the cheap labor force) has backfired on him because now he's lost my custom for life!  The few dimes he hoped to save by hiring cheap (and ineffective) labor from India has actually cost him his customer base (in my case at least).

The last few items I've ordered from Amazon (not from 3rd party sellers) have been terribly packaged and arrived defective. Amazon does take returns, but shipping it back is a huge hassle and nobody ever bothers to apologize for wasting my time when they send me a broken item. There is nobody held responsible and there's no way to contact them directly if I want to ask for them to package a delicate item more appropriately.

On top of the broken items and extra slow shipping, I've recently been locked out of my account because of security issues that they will not clarify. I've called their customer service- and they've been incredibly useless, namely because they're outsourced oversea. Nobody will tell me why I can't get into my account. They tell me they don't know and another department will handle it. I ask to speak to that department and they say they will contact me. It's been days and I've heard nothing. If I didn't have a gift card balance, I'd likely just forget about my account and be done with them.

707,"The thing that sways me away from ordering things from Amazon is that they do not have a return policy.  True that it is great they have a fast shipping and a wide variety of products, but the problem is that they should be enforcing the 30-90 days return policy towards sellers.  It would demand that sellers sell legit products that aren't going to break within two weeks.  I bought a few things from them and it never lasts more than 2-3 weeks!  At walmart, target and any local store would allow for returns if you bought an item that would be defective.  I would have just bought it at the store but I am extremely busy, I guess I will have to make time to go and buy the products at the store instead.

The 1st took 2 tries (warehouse deals) because the 1st didn't operate at all (wasted time!); thankfully, the 2nd was the winner. Then with my present order: Am very frustrated with their present delivery arrangement. I, of course, opted for free ship, which stated 5-8days, but in the process of completing the order, I was immediately informed that it would arrive in 9days- this is fraudulent, and ridiculously long, by today's standards (I shop at many sites). (the audio item took 7 days) Today is over 4 days after I placed the last order, and it hasn't been pulled yet, so I doubt it will arrive on the 9th day. Wasted an hour w/ cust. service (3 reps) who could not accelerate the order (one item would have an increased price), and after all that, would not even issue a courtesy store credit, for the FRAUDULENT advertising, and my wasted time (a small credit was offered in the distant past by their reps). I believe the few customers who haven't paid for Prime Ship are penalized for doing so...all other ""shortcuts"" and customer disservice are apparently needed to fund Bezos' master plan to overtake the world.

712,"When you search for an item, you can waste hours finding what you want, because there is no policing of the rules.  You can get literally thousands of hits that have nothing to do with the keywords you entered.  In order to search by price, you must select one of Amazon's often pointlessly similar categories.  Then, often, you will get literally thousands of entries that are identical.  For many items, you will get thousands of entries that have price $0.01, accompanied by shipping costs of, for example, $10.00.  This makes searching by price futile.  If you want to skip over these thousands of rule violators, you can't do it because Amazon only lets you skip ahead 2 pages.  (Not only that, but they won't let you see more than 25 items per page.)  They ought to let you enter the number of the page you want to visit next.
I have complained to Amazon numerous times about this, pointing out that the experience at their competitor Ebay, for example, is much better.  I have threatened to file criminal complaints against them for being a nuisance.  They don't care.

They appear to be in the market to control the entire online experience which is good and bad.  When their investors were paying for the services (their stocks skyrocketed even though they rarely showed profits), they could afford to do this.  But now that investors are starting to demand some sort of steady profitability and some return on their investments other than inflated stocks, Amazon looks like they are starting to worry and this is why they tend to manipulate buyer reviews.

My last complaint took over a month, because seller wasn't responding to them either!  What was to investigate?

Out of the last 5 videos I've watched, 3 that I didn't finish watching became unavailable to me the VERY NEXT DAY!! If Amazon Prime Video sent out a notice saying I had to watch the whole video in one day, they didn't tell me. So all 3 movies I watched about 2/3 of the way through, fully believing I could watch the ending the next day. Oh no! 2 of the videos were NO LONGER INCLUDED ON PRIME THE VERY NEXT DAY!! The 3rd video was UNAVAILABLE! Hey, Amazon, that's not RIGHT TO DO! These were all either really old movies from the '90's or kind of jerky movies that the Sci-Fy channel used to show. That's another thing about Prime Videos-no current or recently current movies. That doesn't bother me, but when they are starting to shut off my access to the ends of movies, THAT ISNT RIGHT!

As for Amazon as a whole, I use it to buy almost everything.  I recommend that you always look to make sure each purchase is ""Fulfilled by Amazon"" before you buy it. I made a couple purchases that weren't all that great, and Amazon made sure I got a refund. Quickly, too. There are many sponsored items now, and most sellers are ethical and decent.

1) customer
2) entrepreneur 

As a customer, I've found good deals but recently I was what one could say as ""screwed over.""

I ordered a book on July 22 which was supposed to be delivered by Sep 5. 
The book never showed up and I had to wait until October 2 to get it! 

As an Entrepreneur, I have a webstore on Amazon which has proved to be a nightmare. 
Firstly, inventory between .CA and .US is considered separate.
So in order for your products to climb the page rankings, although you have listings that pertain to both Canada and USA, only sales from each country will help you climb your rank-individually. This makes it extremely competitive. 

Also, setting up the page was very difficult. There was no customer service. 
The account manager simply told me to watch a ""tutorial.""
What is he/she getting paid for? 

It turned out that all my inventory got sent to Amazon's warehouse where they ended up losing the inventory, and once found, refused to store it for Amazon fulfillment, because our product bottles where ""oversized,""-something they did not worn use about beforehand! 

The point is, as customer buying products Amazon is decent, but as someone trying to sell products (business seller's account), make sure you do your homework in advance and DO NOT rely on your account manager to help you out!",2,“Amazon is really broken down into two categories:” 
734,"(Fifth update.) I've been purchasing from Amazon fairly heavily for years, not because I think it's the best source for merchandise (although it often is) but because its gift cards are the reward of choice for my participation answering queries for helpowl.com [which I've also reviewed for SiteJabber].

Pluses:

1. Price. Prices are generally excellent, and some purchases are tax-free. Many items are ""eligible for free shipping,"" meaning that Amazon will not charge for shipping such items if their total price in one order is $25 or more. 

2. Return policy. Return policies are easy and quite generous, and with items shipped by Amazon the company pays for return shipping, or may even waive the need to return the item at all.

3. Promptness. Shipping is always prompt, even when free.

Minuses:

1. Support. I've now downgraded my star rating because of the increasingly terrible customer service. The good news is that phone support is usually, perhaps always, available. The bad news is the quality of that support:
(a) Thick accents by agents apparently based in other countries--even supervisors--make their advice largely unintelligible.
(b) Even when one can understand them, too many of the support personnel seem entirely clueless, taking the customer's time to no good end. Escalating to a supervisor sometimes works but often does not; and written support, usually provided as boilerplate, is usually still worse.
(c) Inquiries to Amazon's sellers must almost always be made via Amazon's online form; and, incredibly, Amazon cannot track such inquiries or follow up unless the purchase has already been made.

2. Product descriptions. These are wrong much too often. 

3. Product search. The variety of products available is overwhelming, and Amazon's product search engine is awful. For example, a search for a ""queen-size single fitted sheet"" yielded many hundreds of results (as I recall, about 1,400!), pointing to sheets of various sizes, nearly all sheets sets. Of all those results I found only 1 that matched my search criteria. One suspects that Amazon deliberately fudges search results to offer more choices, with the goal of increasing sales.

4. Merchant reviews. As of last check Amazon allows reviewers without significant limitation to withdraw their reviews. This policy encourages merchants -- many of whom depend on Amazon for patronage -- to go after reviewers whose reviews are not favorable in order to buy them off. This has happened to me.

The consequence of these minuses is that you could easily spend hours trying to meet your need, which may in the end be unfulfilled or, even worse, fulfilled badly.",2,“(Fifth update.) I've been purchasing from Amazon fairly...”

Because I am a person Who Really Enjoys Writing Reviews On All Types Of Products I've Try. And I Write And Say What I Mean. Rather I Like The Product or Not. And Amazon Makes It Very Hard For People Like Me To Voice Our Point Of View. On Products We Have Try and Tested. Amazon is Deleted so many People Reviews Over Some Dumb Stuff.  All They Do is just Delete With out Really Explaining Why. This is what they say:Amazon does not permit reviews from customers whose relationship to the product or seller may be perceived as biased. 

I Mean WTF Are They Talking About??? What if that person don't have a Relationship with the seller and all that BS? I Feel That Amazon is so wrong on that. And They Are Letting a lot of people go over some BS.  I've Been With Amazon For a Long Time. And I Also Pay For Amazon PRIME! And I Cant Even Write a Freaking Review or even Ask a Question on a product I wanna buy! That's BS! But Other Then All That Its a Great Site, With Many Great Deals. Just There Guidelines Suck Butt!

771,"I must admit I have a hidden agenda. I posted two reviews and I was shocked to see a 180k views. I was angry but I never wanted to shame this company before the world like that. I think there should be a time limit on all reviews. People change and companies too. We need to forgive even as we want to be forgiven. Life happens but thanks God it is not always the end of the world, yet. So here - today I want to share a little bit of good news and common sense for all you online shoppers and people looking for that opportunity to get out of the mess you find yourselves in. We all struggle but it is when you are poor and needy and in debt that the pressures really hit home and where hopelessness tries to kill the joy of living.

Everybody knows or want to know some kind of secret to making money and to be successful. A wise man listens to counsel but too many voices will drive you mad. Do you prefer the paperless route to getting rich quick, or do you have a proper plan to prosper that will make you rich? Countless money making offers and investment opportunities floats out there both online and offline. But for your own peace of mind and safety, it is most advisable to Google search different reviews on each selected choice before signing up or buying in. Many come with that deceitful free label that stings, like a hook to the bait. Often people are invited to financial seminars to help them cope or escape their current state of affairs into a Utopia, a lifestyle of milk and honey. And like any good business, they do require you to invest time and money. And as for good farming, it is essential to prepare the soil for sowing and reaping, which may take months and even years to fully mature. But dont despair, hard work has its rewards. 

But it is in these hard times when the vulnerable and desperate are lured with fast food cash-ins and drive off scams. Most offers are so tempting it's hard to resist, and when swallowed it has that bittersweet ending. Just like, when the serpent deceived Eve with his cunning sales act. Did God really say that? Its because he doesn't want you to become like gods too. Just try it once, no one will know! And when she saw that the fruit was good to eat, she ate of the forbidden tree of knowledge of good and evil. Then she also gave to her husband, and when he took his first bite, the whole world went into a total Black-Out. And instead of becoming like gods, they got caught naked and hiding from God.

This is a clip out of the book God and Money now available. It is a world of wisdom for one happy meal. But if you really can not afford it, I will send you the ebook for free.

Most of the time Im searching for an old movie which you would think would be available but they never are regardless of the title  and its age.  I receive emails reminding me to make use of my prime membership for movies but the ones I want to see are not available.  Why wouldnt movies from the 80s, 90s or early 2000s cost me money or not be available?",3,“Prime movie availability is next to nil” 
773,"While the customer service is great, its not  a good place for business as they get hammered. Secondly they have too many fakes on the site, sure I can get my money back, but I dont want to have to go through the hassle. I want to buy a product that is great not one that looks great but works terribly. Now overseas firms are hiring SEO specialists that game the system and allow inferior products to rank higher or at least thats my take.  This means a company can make a knockoff product sell it for ¼ of the price and rank higher. Who do you think the average Joe is going to buy from?  Amazon needs to go after counterfeiters with a bigger stick",3,“Too many fakes on the site”

I have paid for Prime since the beginning and while most of it arrives on time, not all does. And it always seems to be a gift I ordered.

Pay for Prime--2 days delivery, right?   Except when it's not.  There are so many exceptions.  Each unit of Amazon has it's own rules and you get an order together, each is shipped with different rules, and you find you didn't meet the minimums for each.

I also don't like how they raised their minimum free shipping from $25 to $35, yet if you make that amount, they don't automatically click the box ""free ship"" when checking out.  They click 2 day ship for a fee and you need to manually un click and look for free ship.",3,“The Usual” 
795,"Amazon was my first online shopping experience and it was amazing. You placed your order and it arrived in a matter of days, it was exactly what you paid for w/o any worries.

For me even though I probably spend close to a hundred in shipping , I don't want to be told to pay this amount and "" you'll get better service from us !"" So now if your not a Prime customer , your shipping can take days to weeks to arrive (if at all). Many times you deal with new seller's , and your order never comes. Amazon has purchased a newspaper , they've ventured into making movies , debating purchasing pharmaceutical and the one thing that got them started their losing focus on, great deals from reputable sellers and great shipping. If you stretch yourself to thin , you fall apart and their services are doing that.  I ordered an item 4 times , from 4 different seller's , it took 2 months and it never came. Amazon did refund my money back through their A-Z customer service , but all I wanted was my item ! Now after all these years of being a dedicated customer , I'm looking for another place to shop.",3,"“My Online Love,  Has Now Become Very Troublesome” "

I have had issues with things not being delivered and getting refunds back but overall the items ordered do arrive and are as described. I do not think that they find the best deals for me and their search options are not helpful to narrow the search to the items you are seeking. Often I have seen that an items is advertised at a lower price than you end up paying and that is annoying. For example, you find a hat and the small size is cheap but the medium size is 2x the price of the small. There is not reason for such a price difference. Other times you see something for $4 and click on it only to find that the $4 is not an option at all and the cheapest color/size/etc is $6 for example soo.......find what you need and then still price compare.",3,“Nice if you have prime” 
797,Amazon is the easiest single source to shop from but all it takes is a single look at pricing history of an item to shock you. The price you pay is not consistent over time. There are websites that let you enter an Amazon URL and view past pricing and more folks should be aware of these. If saving money is more important than convenience you can almost always beat Amazon,3,“Best selection but watch pricing schemes” 
798,"My product (a Nikon DSLR camera) took so long to ship, when I asked the seller about it she kept on telling me, and I quote ""i'll ask the warehouse what's up"" Really, and the communication was far between. I did receive the product a month later but I'm not happy with the experience",3,“Communication and delivery was meh” 
799,"Loved Amazon for many many years.

Since Prime came along it became harder and harder as non-prime member to make purchases; to the point that I no longer make purchases from Amazon.

I have reverted to using Ebay, Walmart Online, and alternate sites for products I want which Amazon will only sell as a prime product.This is the case with any new order now. There will always be one prime item not available, unless you are prime member.

For prime members I am sure this is satisfactory. However, I can not justify prime membership.",3,“Not easy to use unless Prime member” 
800,"Amazon has a lot to offer, that's for sure. However, I try not to order much that's either sold/shipped by Amazon or fulfilled by Amazon because they play too much with their shipping. 

The last few orders I placed on Amazon that were either sold/fulfilled by Amazon took longer than a week just to get shipped. Most businesses can manage to ship out in-stock items in one business day, two tops. However, I've had Amazon wait 9 business days to ship, while my order's status has said ""preparing for shipment"" for 4 days. As I'm not Prime member, I feel like they do this on purpose so you'll have to wait upward of a week to get your items because they know that if they ship your items out the next business day, USPS will usually deliver in about 3 days, so why pay for Prime for a one day difference?

I never have this issue when I order items sold by a third party. I've even called Amazon about why it was taking days to ""prepare my shipment"" but even they couldn't tell me why or even what the real status of my order was. Oddly enough, after first telling me that my order didn't go through due to a server issue to the items just not being in stock, about one hour later, my order shipped out from a city about 60 miles away from me. My order was delivered the next morning in a box that was way too big and not even taped all the way shut.

802,"Amazon is a great website that sells things for cheap. I have ordered many things off of Amazon  and I have only had two problems with the site.  The first problem, is that I ordered an item  for a gift to my father.  In the description it told me that it was a 1000 lumen flashlight (very bright).  When I finally received it in the mail ( around a month later )  it was nowhere near 1000 lumens. It was MAYBE around 50 lumens.  We were both very disappointed considering I spent $20 on a flashlight I could buy at a gas station.  The other problem is shipping. I have ordered some items and they have came in around 3 days later and  then I have had items that have came in around 2 MONTHS later.  Overall, they are a good site but you have to watch out for false advertisement and make sure that you'll be  okay with waiting months to receive your package .",3,“Varied shipping”

so until Amazon gets the shipping in Europe method down I won't be shopping here unless I absolutely need the item.  You question me back by saying well order form another site and you will see Shipping is just as expensive? my answer is sadly no this is not the case.

Every order I have placed in the last year has not been shipped for at least 6 days, and usually more (my last order was 8 days ago, and it hasn't shipped yet), after I placed the order. The shipping itself is fast, always 1-2 days, so they aren't using a cheaper shipping method to save costs. But they hold your order for about a week before processing and shipping it so normally you will receive it 8-10 days after you place your order.

I moved into town from the rural outskirts in 2014. My orders were then predominantly coming via United States Postal Service and therein was part of the reason I down rated them in this review. Orders are frequently delivered to wrong addresses, or not delivered at all. It has been a pain.  I have begged Amazon to use UPS or FedEx for my orders. They refuse. Also, I started questioning the prices. I am not talking about the resellers, as they can price as absurdly as they wish. I mean items sold and shipped by Amazon: Dawn Dishwashing Liquid, 32.4 ounce is $3.99 in local and other online stores, but Amazon is asking $11.99 for the exact same thing. And that is just one of many examples I've found recently. I still love Amazon, but they are going to have to tighten up the ship as competition is growing. They must stop promising free shipping then charging me three times the market price. And they need to dump the USPS.",3,“Amazon is in Decline”

Amazon never really seems to offer great deals unless you have Amazon Prime, in which case you would want to use it very regularly for it to become worth the yearly fee.  Once in a while, I'll find something on Amazon that has a cheaper price than eBay or other random websites I find through Google Shopping, but probably 3 out of 4 times, I find that their prices are higher than the super discounted prices you can find on eBay, and are more on par with your local department stores.  I also almost never find free shipping an option on Amazon, but you see it all the time on eBay.  The only thing Amazon has going for them is the convenience factor of buying online, and of course a ton of product reviews to narrow down what you're looking for.

At the same time received one from Amazon saying it was shipped. On Sunday? Still have not received an answer to correct status. The main issue with Amazon though is their free shipping. You have to buy so much to qualify, an amount they raise at times. Yet if you take advantage of this your order goes to the back of the line. Not always do they meet the promised shipping date if it takes too long, they just change it. This has happened every time it seems like. It's taken up to a week before for an item to ship out when choosing free shipping, but if you use a debit card they bill you when an order placed, not when shipped as most vendors do. Vendors have an authorization when placing an order so payment guaranteed until shipped, then hard charge, but Amazon actually runs it through now when order placed. Maybe they know it may take a week to ship. They've actually acknowledged using free shipping makes it a low priority order. Only if a private vendor ships themselves does it go out faster.They're CS is apparently outsourced which at times makes it hard to communicate.

913,"Amazon.com prices are going up and up... Why?

I've been shopping on Amazon.com for more than a decade now. However, in the last couple of years, their prices have been surging up well above the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) on many items. It used to be that they had the lowest prices on most anything. Now, that is not the case and I am very leery when I shop on Amazon.com 

Just this week, I walked through retail shops like Bed, Bath and Beyond, (certainly not a bargain store) and checked prices on Amazons site on my smartphone while in the shop. I found BBBs prices (before discount) were significantly lower (40% lower on some items) than Amazon's best ""prime members only"" prices. Yes, Amazon's price was nearly double the price of some items at BBB. Every item I looked at was priced lower than the best Amazon.com's price from any seller thereon. And again, that is before factoring in a 20% added discount at BBB.  

When I go to some manufacturer's websites, I find their MSRP is significantly lower than Amazon's best prices. For example, just today I found the Navy Sport-Brella Versa-Bella priced at $26 on Amazon.com when it can be purchased directly from the manufacturer for $20. That same umbrella is available at many other retail stores and websites for the same $20, but Amazon.com wants an extra 30% above MSRP.  Why???

And now with Amazon's $49 minimum for free shipping, I am looking at other options and away from their greed-driven ways. I understood when it went from $25 to $35 (times change; shipping costs go up). But then it jumped to $49 in no time. While other companies are lowering their minimum purchase for free shipping, Amazon is raising theirs. 

Frankly, with Amazon.com's jacked-up prices, it's getting harder and harder to find $50 worth of items that I want on their website that I can't get elsewhere for less money.

What happened, and why such a significant greed-driven shift in the last year or two, Amazon? How much profit is really enough, Mr. Bezos???

My suggestion to other shoppers: Do what Im now doing Check and compare prices in local retail shops and/or on other websites before you buy from Amazon.com. While Amazons prices are still better on some items, their prices on other items may give you severe sticker shock. In the end you may be surprised to learn that Amazon.com is not the bargain store it used to be.",3,"“Amazon.com Prices Going UP, UP UP!!!” "

Also if you buy comforters and comforter sets be careful I ordered a couple and ended up not even getting what I thought I ordered , I got micro fiber which I hat,,  it looks cheap I washed it according to the instructions and ended up with a blob the middle batting was all bunched up in one corner.  The she'll of the comforter was very thin and ripped easily  . I have ordered sheets sets and did not get the thread count I paid for the colors we're right but that's it.

MY MAIN PROBLEM WAS THAT, ONCE I ACTUALLY ORDERED THE ITEM, IT THEN SHOWED THAT THE ITEM WOULD NOT BE DELIVERED UNTIL FRIDAY, SEPT 30 ..!!

I CALLED AMAZON AND SPOKE TO 4 DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN CUSTOMER SERVICE.  EACH ONE TOLD ME THAT THIS DID NOT MAKE SENSE TO THEM EITHER BUT THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO UPGRADE THE DELIVERY OR SPEED THE DELIVERY IN ANY WAY AND MY ITEM WOULD STILL NOT BE DELIVERED UNTIL SEPT. 30 - EVEN THOUGH THE WEBSITE SHOWS ""GUARANTEED DELIVERY DATE OF SEPT 29""
NONE OF THE 4 PEOPLE COULD EXPLAIN WHAT THE WORD ""GUARANTEED"" MEANT IN THIS INSTANCE, NOR WOULD ANY OF THEM OFFER ANY SORT OF COMPENSATION FOR THIS 'FALSE ADVERTISING' ..  
ONE REP TOLD ME THAT IF MY DAUGHTER HAD ORDERED IT DIRECTLY THEN SHE MIGHT HAVE RECEIVED IT BY 09-29 ..  AND THAT IF I HAD ORDERED IT FOR MYSELF, I MIGHT HAVE RECEIVED IT BY 09-29 ..  THIS DID NOT MAKE ANY SORT OF SENSE TO ME WHATSOEVER .. ?!
THE LAST REP (SUPPOSEDLY SOME SORT OF SUPERVISOR) TOLD ME THAT EVEN THOUGH THE WORDING SAID ""GUARANTEED DELIVERY DATE ... ... "" SUDDENLY HER WEBSITE SHOWED THAT THE EARLIEST DELIVERY DATE WAS NOW 09-30 ..  EVEN THOUGH I WAS LOOKING DIRECTLY AT THE WEBSITE AT THAT MOMENT AND MY SCREEN STILL SHOWED 09-29 .. ?!?!?

I ASKED HER FOR AN UPPER ESTABLISHMENT PERSON TO DISCUSS THIS MATTER WITH AND SHE TOLD ME THAT CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS THE ONLY PLACE I COULD TALK TO TO AT ALL ..

927,"My biggest issue with Amazon is the reviews. 

The have paid reviewers at the top of the lists. Don't see a conflict with someone being paid to review a product? 

They lump all reviews for similar models, some models are vastly different in specs and configuration. You could have one model that is great and another model that is a POS but Amazon lumps them together and you don't know until someone posts a model number in their review. You will think a item is great when it is known to be defective. Amazon is well aware of this issue but will not do anything about it.

Don't ever use Amazon Services. First off, Amazon techs are subcontractors, nothing more. We have never set foot in a Amazon facility. Amazon does not actually vet their technicians. They have changed policies so many times due to techs going onsite drunk/high and stealing/breaking things at customers sites. I don't doubt that Amazon fixes all the issues but some items are not replaceable. Issues with businesses quoting one price then jacking it up when they get onsite.

Amazon returns are great, Customer service is great IF YOU USE THE PHONE. Email support is terrible, just like everyone else. Cut and paste responses that have no bearing on your issue.",3,“Good prices on products but everything else is meh”

933,"Amazon Is Mostly An Adequate Company, But I Have Had Problems With Them.

Amazon offers a variety of services, just like Google, etc. This is why I am giving them three stars.

Their online store(s) have declined and are getting EVEN WORSE. They need to EXPAND their services, NOT THEIR FEES. 

I have switched from ebay to go to a more capable company such as Amazon. Amazon actually handles the packages while ebay does not. If you have any negative feedback then TOO BAD. EBAY WILL REMOVE IT! But Amazon so far has not.

The quality of Ebay's shipping was superior. And so was Amazon's. But then the quality has lowered with Ebay. AND NOW IT HAS WITH AMAZON. I do not want to wait all week for EXPENSIVE ONE AND TWO DAY SHIPPING OPTIONS. Also, I must be able to select my carrier.

So bye bye star.

Amazon also has had hostile workplace environment. Poor slave workers.

So bye bye second star.

934,I do a lot of on line shopping and I was looking for a good blender. I checked out Ebay and a few other stores when I came acrossed Amazon they had a vitamixer it was very expensive but it was the best price around. We had it for a week when error messages kept showing up. I contacted the seller and got no were so I Emailed Amazon they said they would have to get back to me. I also Emailed Vitamix told them my story they sent me another one out but first they asked me for serial number and where I bought it when I told them where and how I bought it they said that unit was in fact used the seller new it and I suspect  Amazon new it as well. Amazon said that I would have to ship it back to  the seller etc etc be careful who you buy from Amazon does not have the buyer back.,3,“Sell used as new”

We recently purchased a vitamix which included quite a big recipe book.  I am not happy with most games.  They are poor quality and consumer has to make at least one purchase to review an item.

I already had to buy them new pencil cases. 

Amazon needs to add sections for retailers who are able to deliver on time.

942,"To be fair to Amazon, books are great through this source. I got some great editions of Kant and Sartre through this site. However, fellow movie collectors: beware. I have coveted Raise The Red Lantern for ages. Try getting it from the two mail order movie sites like MU. Amazon promised me a pristine new copy for a king's ransom, I paid close to fifty bucks for a single movie, I know, stop laughing, when it arrived it looked like a whole drawer's worth of silverware had fallen on it. The circular scratches covered it completely, I never play the return game, in Amazon's defense, perhaps they would have corrected it. Unfortunately and, conveniently coincidentally, it just happened to be the last 'new' one they had. Now you see why I didn't try, don't you? 
   If this was the 'brand new' one, imagine what the 'used' ones looked like? I have had three orders of philosophical works that were all excellent. I simply need to share with fellow movie collectors that this was the single worst looking fifty dollar 'brand new' disc that I have ever seen. Three players would not play this movie, I would stick to other items besides DVDs. In Amazon's defense, both mail order movie houses are notorious for sending other people's returns out as new movies. I dropped one of them for consistently mailing me unplayable, scratched beyond repair discs. I did take offense at the adjectives 'brand new' 'never been played,' this disc looked worse than movies I have owned for over a decade. Stick To Other Items. Take Care. Deus Vobiscum.

I do now that I have purchased counterfeit cosmetics and a Isaac Mizrahi bag.  Back in March I purchased what I thought was an Isaac Mizrahi bag.  I was saving it for the summer.  I received it and thought it looked nice but didn't thoroughly examine it.  When I finally looked at the bag...Isaac Mizrahi does not stamp his bag in cheap gold ink.  The bag wasn't even leather.  By the time it was uncovered...it was too late to get refunded.  I also have bought counterfeit lipsticks. I did 2 things.  I went to YouTube on how to spot the fakes and it all matched up.  I had a family friend who is a manager at an Ulta cosmetics store confirm this too.  I would not have suspected an inexpensive makeup brand like NYX to have counterfeits buy unfortunately they do.  I was refunded but that's not the point.  I was going to order an Anastasia Beverly Hills contour palette at $45 ...$5 more than they charge at Sephora.  I read at least 5 reviews that said they received a counterfeit and one person uploaded a photo of the color swatches of the real vs the fake.  They are charging $5 more for a counterfeit item.  Amazon has some good deals and some things are overpriced.  I will still order from them but am limited to what I buy from there after reading the counterfeit reviews and experiencing this with some of their items myself.,3,“Not as good as they previously were.

1012,"For the most part, I do like Amazon and shopping on the site. My complaints would be that if you live in apartment or aren't home when the item ordered arrives, they will leave the item in plain view where someone can see it or take it. As of January 2015, the USPS will no longer take your package back to the post office if a delivery is missed. Most items are no longer shipped by UPS. I live in an apartment and have had my packages left in the mail room area. Where anyone can take it. Amazon will only replace a stolen item ONCE.

1013,I bought a shoes wich has been sent with different size but amazon want didn't pay for Domage as I couldn't go to my party due to that mistake they should do something about that by making a discount on the item.,3,“Wrong item sent and I have to pay for return” 
1014,"I buy via Amazon about 3 times a month...I find them very good to compare similar products of what you are looking for, and narrow down a buying decision. I stay away from items that have a high chance of needing to be returned, so I do my research first to avoid the return-process. 
I also try to stick to products that Amazon themselves ships, so I have more predictability on how long it will take.
Up to now, have only returned one item out of many purchased...good track record for Amazon...return-process was smooth, but rather avoid it..
One of my few complaints about this site, is that many products are not displayed-photographed properly nor extensively, so often it's hard to see as much as I want to see; the whole idea of buying online is to be able to visualize what we are buying as best as possible, since we are not at a store actually seeing-feeling the product. Amazon could make the website more visually appealing and have their vendors improve the product representation in photos.
Another minor issue, is that the first thing I want to see from a vendor, other than feedback, is where do they ship from?( When not shipped from Amazon)...Amazon gives you the info, but not to handy (you have to dig for it).
Conclusion: I usually use Amazon for specific products that I've pre-decided I need and know something about (usually I check Ebay as well to compare)...I don't wander around just looking at products for shopping-fun, but rather chase specific product-needs I have determined (example: I need a spare camera battery for my Nikon: I go to Amazon first, and cross-check with Ebay prices. Eight out of 10 times I find Amazon offers better choices & service, and a simpler return-process if needed...
Example of an Amazon typical purchase of mine: camera lens...Best Buy has it at store for significantly more than Amazon...Ebay has a similar price but a vendor with feedback I don't care for...Amazon has it at a competitive price, and shipped-handled by Amazon: I buy it from Amazon.

1038,"Dear Amazon,
You've changed. I miss who you used to be when you were young and insecure with your place in this world. Back when you refused to chase after others, but preferred to ""innovate ahead"" of them. We all got so used to your prices being the lowest, back when you'd undercut everyone, even to the detriment of your own balance sheets. You were such a risk-taker.

But you've long secured your place at the top of the e-commerce food chain, and your price points are creeping steadily upward as you continue to eat yourself. You're finding new ways to manipulate us into spending more in order to get free 2-day shipping. You've rolled out highly complex subscription programs that confuse and befuddle. You're trying to be Saks and Google and Apple and Netflix, etc.  all at once. But you've never been that cool, nor will you be. 

I'll never buy your fancy clothes, nor your failed smart phone (although if the price drops any further, I might pick one up as a toy for my 5-year-old nephew). But I will admit, with impunity, you're the first place I go when I know exactly what I need and I need it within 2 days.

Sorry for using you for your cheap and fast shipping. Sorry if I've reduced you to a booty call. Hope we can still see each other when it's right for both of us.

After being placed on hold for 20 minutes while the finalized the 2nd order I am told that 1 day shipping is not available for this item, and amazon is able to offer me a 5$ gift certificate for the hassle. 
I was already a little bothered that after 8 days I had to call for Amazon to tell me the package was lost. To then be offered a quick fix and then be told its not possible, brought me to a point of anger. 
Amazon needs to train their customer support team to better handle situations and use better wording when speaking to guests. As someone who works directly with clients, one of the basic rules in customer care  is to NEVER offer something you cannot guarantee and that is exactly what happened. The manager/supervisors solution was to extend my Prime membership an extra month.  Besides this one incident, Amazon has been able to deliver items within 3 days of purchase including Sundays.

The 3 points only applies to Amazon.com purchases (plus a few other categories on Amazon.com, see below). Because so much of the merchandise on Amazon's site is not from ""Amazon.com"", but from affiliated and third party sellers, you may find that many of your purchases made on Amazon.com aren't really ""Amazon.com"" and therefore don't actually qualify for the 3 points.

MY ORIGINAL REVIEW, EDITED:

Amazon's merchandise is packaged well and shipped quickly, with very few exceptions.  If you have a problem, they work with you.  Their customer service and return policy are superior.  

Use caution when purchasing food products.  Consider the time of year, the vendor's reviews, and customer reviews.  You may not always be able to return edible items, but in one case I did get a refund because the product was completely disgusting.  Be polite and thorough in your reasons for returning anything, and there's often a chance Amazon will refund your money.",3,“Pushing the envelope too far on shipping”

Other than that, I was thinking of getting a fighting pad controller for the PS3. However, they ran out and it costs more than $35 to get it from... United Kingdom. Some prices of the products the other sellers handed out are more than their original prices. It's unbelievable to have Gears of War on the PC being sold secondhand for $33 on Amazon compared to $20 on Windows Games Live Marketplace.

What's good for me is the prime membership. They may give me free shipping, but I'm still furious with the warehouse deals selling a game ""like new"" for $33.

I always complained and let Jeff Bezos, CEO know I was an ethical seller and it was unethical the way Amazon just freely uses our money to give back to customer. Now I get really good customer service and if any customer complains, Amazon pays. That is not what a lot of sellers can say even sellers who make more than a half a million do not receive good customer care from Amazon. I will say the buyers are much more serious as well and will pay for expensive items more readily than any other e-commerce site I have ever sold on, in my humble opinion. I like to sell on Amazon better now than when we first started.

1163,"To date I haven't had a problem returning an Amazon product within the return window and sometimes I've been giving extended time to do so. But to my surprise I've bought a few bad items based on FAKE 5 or 4 star reviews. Some of those reviews stick out easly due to them having the same typo error patterns. 
Example:  ""love this.great product."" Or ""bought two.love it.""

I have also noticed ""Bad"" reviews that were fake. They sometimes name another product they say is better. Some are being done by competiting companies and about 95% are not from Verified Buyers. Within the comment section under a bad review is where I first noticed a FAKE bad review. The sellers would be trying to resolve the issue and the customer seem to not want any type of resolution not even in returning the product. The seller claimed that the buyer was not a real buyer and that it was a fake review and all the customer had to do is return the product but they have no product to return. I'm sure the ones I've read like this we're fake. 

My advise is to make sure the reviews are Verified reviews. I don't trust all of those either but this is a good place to start. Read and ask plenty of questions in the Q&A. Read through the good and bad reviews. Check comments to see if the seller responded to any of the bad reviews",4,“Be Aware of Fake Reviews......”

Im so happy we did. The shows and viewing options are awesome, but they are just the tip of the iceberg. Free 2 day shipping has saved us so many times when we needed something very fast. Weve discovered if you can wait just a few days more, usually Amazon will give you a small credit toward one category or another and they can add up and allow you to get some fun things. 
I keep hearing people describe the features Amazon had before I joined and I really feel like I missed out on some very fun options like being able to get a large variety free books to read every month. I love what Im seeing but I havent heard anything about new features that were comparable to what was taken away. Its unusual to see a company cut back on what they offer instead of adding to it or changing it to something comparable. 
Still, this is the Amazon I know, and although the removed features sound like they could make it even greater, I still enjoy what they do offer. I suppose ignorance is bliss as long as they hold off on removing features Im getting used to having with them.",4,"“Love Amazon Prime, whist theyd stop taking features” "
1203,"good shop website,i have buy customized tshirt in this website and very satisfied it,Amazon used to be amazing. That is before the out of country and scammers got involved. I've had numerous orders not show up and told was delivered but when I checked the address wasn't mine.",4,“good” 
1204,"I order from Amazon very often, at least once a month. I love the selection of items that I can browse. I've ordered everything from shoes to make up. I am not a Prime member, but I should really sign up, as they have great perks for shoppers. If the item I order is shipped by Amazon, it's pretty much guaranteed that the order will arrive within a few days. But if its offered by a sub contractor it may take a little longer. I have only had one bad experience with a shipment. I ordered an eye shadow palette that arrived broken. I snapped a pic and sent it to the seller and my Amazon account was credited that day. So I love Amazon!",4,“Grrat experience”

1207,I've been with Amazon over 5 years and the shipping and handling is ridiculous...sure some of the things are cheap. ..but once the shipping and handling cost is added it's no longer a deal...I found a better site called jet.com...2 day delivery guaranteed ...and free shipping on 35 dollars and up...I've also found a lot more better deals,4,“I've found better”

1209,"The return process is exceptional. All you have to do is locate the order on your account, hit return items and they send you a return label which you can just print off through your email. Then you stick it on there and ship it back no hassle. They also give you plenty of time to send your items back out. Instead of the normal 2-3 business days most places give you. You don't have to talk to a customer service rep at all and you don't have to send out emails and wait for a response. You also do not have to wait for your refund;  as soon as you drop your return off at the ups or local post office and they scan it in, you get your full refund. 

The customer service if you do decided to call is complicated and they mess up your orders hard core if you need something changed. I placed 2 orders and needed to cancel one so I called the phone line and asked them to cancel it. They cancelled the wrong one so I had to call back again and cancel everything because the rep was confused and didn't know what he was doing.Then It was a fight and alot of confusion about the refund for the orders. I guess it all worked out in the end but I didn't re order the purchase I had originally wanted to keep. Instead of cancelling an order it is easier to have it sen to you and do process a refund. It is much easier. They also have a lot of fake reviews on items but they are pretty easy to spot. 

Other than that I use amazon for alot. Love it.",4,“Use them all the time.”

This is more so if you order items that are not sold/shipped from Amazon directly. For me it took 4.5 MONTHS  to get a refund for an item I didnt even order. However I've also had packages that did not arrive by the schedualed date and they gave me a full refund no questions asked. So like i said it's pretty good though it does have its annoyances.

I emailed customer service at Amazon asking if this was condoned and/or prevalent and what action they would take.

Try emailing customer services at Amazon. You can simply cannot. There is a lengthy procedure but no options for general points like this

So.. two things. Their reviews from 3rd parties may be highly biased and when you try to be ever so helpful by forwarding a copy of the 3rd party's email to Amazon, you cannot do so and have to resort to this. Maybe Amazon will read it.

1316,"I have bought DVDs and books from Amazon for many years.  Ordering and delivery updates impeccable. Never any uncertainty.  And they could turn up sources for out-of-print books and rather obscure foreign-language DVDs.  But lately I have run into dead-ends on some items, particularly on the number of outside suppliers from which to choose the best version of a title.  They are often forgetting to mention if an English language DVD has subtitles (required to follow some plots and nerdy dialogues).  It's just a bit harder to collect the vital statistics for a prospective purchase regarding publication data, abridgement, photos, translators.  The things which make one edition of a book better than another.  I could approach suppliers for the details but in the past I could usually get them from the Amazon descriptive entry or sometimes by looking at the book cover thumbnail.  Views of other viewers and readers welcome.",4,“Amazon stocking narrower title range ?”

1331,"I don't find the website that easy to use when you are looking for something specific and trying to figure out who to buy from. Ebay is much easier to know who the seller is and be able to check them out and communicate with them before buying. Amazon is mostly just find it and buy it - it takes a lot of tracking to ask about an item or check into the seller if you can even figure out who the seller is. I like to just buy directly from Amazon and I only buy products I am already familiar with so I know what to expect. Amazon return is easy but if you return for anything other than broken product, you will have to pay the return shipping so it isn't a place you want to try new products out like pet food or buy clothes you aren't sure the size of for that manufacturer unless you don't care about paying to return something. Unless you are prime which I wouldn't know about, shipping can take a long time for certain things. I've had to wait a few days even before my item shipped, as though Amazon was trying to order it to sell to me after I bought it, but they tell you right up front it will be a few days before it ships & then when it does ship, it gets to you fast. The prices are high. I find a lot of things cheaper elsewhere but if you only like to shop in the same place and don't have time to shop around for better prices - you can pretty much find what you want in Amazon as long as it is still manufactured and sold. Otherwise you have to rely on Ebay for hard to find or out of production items & hope someone is selling theirs or stocked up and has some to spare. The thing I use Amazon for the most is product reviews. Whether I am buying from Amazon or not , I never make a big purchase and sometimes don't make a small purchase without first seeing if their are any Amazon reviews. I figure some of them are fakes and self serving but trust the majority of them because you have to have an Amazon account to review & they also show the verified purchasers. Anyhow whether you like or not its a massive online force that isn't going anywhere.",4,“SIte could be better but the service is ok”

1396,"Some of my best experiences have been with amazon.com!!
 I love the fact that as I established myself with this online business I started getting my return refunds to me the same day I shipped a return back!! Even when I first started returning items it would only take about a full budiness week before my refund showed up on my account which wasn't too bad either!
 I've gotten Great Deals On various things that have really made my life easier. I love the fact that I have access to bulk items on almost anything!! Now I've become addicted to comparison shopping in the stores like Wal-Mart, Whole Foods, Ulta, etc for my beauty supplies essential oils. I go on to amazon.com and see if I can get it for better price and oftentimes I can!! especially when it comes to hard-to-find items like essential oils,shipping boxes ,shipping supplies, certain discontinued fragrances/ perfumes, cosmetics , etc. these items are almost always cheaper on Amazon!

I love that the return procedure is easy too. I can drop off my returns at my local Staples that has a UPS drop off on site.
I love the fact that even though I refuse to pay for Prime which is $99 a year they still have thousands of items that offer free shipping with a minimum purchase so if there are several items I plan on buying and they all offer free shipping with a minimum I usually end up getting free shipping anyway so for me it's always great!!
Sometimes I wait until I need a couple of things that allows me to meet the minimum and then I get free shipping without spending $99 a year which I'm sure pays for itself in the long run for consistent. but I'm one of those people that just never knows when I'm going to be shopping on Amazon! sometimes I shop every 3 months sometimes I find something i love every month and sometimes I can go 6 months without making a purchase !! especially if I buy a lot at one time I might only shop 3-4 times a year so on average paying $33  for free shipping kind of doesn't work out for me BUT if you're someone who constantly shops then the $99 is probably worth it!

 the only criticism I have of Amazon is that I wish they would get rid of those overseas Chinese based businesses that sell clothing that are so far off the u.s. sizing that every other review i read is negative about buyes ending up having to return the item because it fit horribly or was made from super cheap material.  
Often times the return cost was so much it paid to just keep the item !! which is very disappointing so I always have to check to see if the sizing is US or a Chinese conversion chart because that right away is a red flag for me!
If they got rid of those sellers I think it help. They don't need subpar cheap items being sold through their site  you can only hurt them in the long run bc I've heard plenty of people who were thinking they were getting this amazing bargain and great fashion ended up with this super cheap stuff plus arriving from overseas sometimes takes weeks!! and when the item finally arrives and it's two and three sizes too small.
I've only bought one item that I knew was not from a us-based manufacturer. I decided to take a chance because I had been looking for this item and of course when I got it not only was it super small but it was defective because there was no button hole for the button!!!which was hilarious and proof positive to me that I need to stay away from those companies!
 but other than that great experience every time",4,“Love Amazon!”

The shipment is taking a bit more than a week for the majority of items ( im in APO AE) unless is something from Hong Kong ..then is taking longer. I only give 4 star because if you don't have a US card , no matter you're paying the same fees for Prime membership - you cannot watch or rent movies and is not fair.

You can get products that you need at great prices and Amazon stands behind everything they sell.  However, like eBay, Amazon is notorious for scalpers who buy products and then resale them for hundreds over MSRP due to shortage of these items.  Apple products and Nintendo products come to mind... If you want something, be sure to purchase them from legitimate sellers.  Don't fall for scalpers which Amazon should not allow.  That is the reason I deduct a point from this review.  Scalpers are the reason why we can't buy products at the MSRP prices... they buy up the supply dry and resale them for much higher prices.  If Amazon and eBay don't allow these scalpers to do business on their sites, consumers would still have a chance to buy these at fair prices.",4,“Buy from Amazon.  Beware of scalpers” 
1424,"I use the Amazon app often and find it relatively simple to use - there are a few issues I have issues wirh.

1431,"I am a prime member of Amazon and have been for at least 3 years. Love it. Amazon leads the pack in online shopping, customer care and a super fast response to complaints. Their shipping is ""very good"" but used to be excellent. The reason for the change is they have switched a lot of shipping from UPS to USPS and this has slowed down deliveries by a day or two.",4,“prime member”

1437,Amazon has just about everything you could want and they ship it fast.  If you have Prime you get free 2 day shipping even on Sundays.  What's cool is they will even do same day shipping for Prime Members if the order is over $35 and it's available in a local warehouse.  The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is their price match policy is lacking compared to all other major retailers.,4,“Amazon is great with Prime”

1440,"I have looked about for a place to review Amazon--especially Amazon Prime. This is the first place I could posit my reservations about it.

I have prime because I have a ""long ish"" Roku relationship and Amazon is making a run at Netflix--I have both streaming services.

But I got Prime in anticipation of a major repair on my house for which I was going to be buying tools and material. the rub is that not much was covered by Prime's
free/fast shipping policies. To be fair, this was not the main thrust of Amazon's marketing but I urge users to be aware that Prime has holes in its coverage in the specifics of books, music, and merchandise that very well may be the main reason you want the service.",4,“Lotsa stuff but Due Diligence” 
1441,Buys dog biscuits and they are pretty good on price and same quality as the shops. I've bought collars and other pet items as well.,4,“Food” 
1442,One of the most wide product ranging website of the world. The delivery service is very fast as compared to other online stores. The service is very reliable.,4,“Reliable and wideranging”

1448,"I have always been a frequent shopper on Amazon and a reviewer too. I love the products, the prices and the service. I would have definitely given it a 5 star rating but the only reason why I gave a 4 is my recent shopping experience with a book that has been out of stock since the past two weeks. I have been contacting Amazon to know how long will the book take to be back in stock- they replied twice and then said they can't help me further with the issue. My question is since Amazon has that book in its listing then it is Amazon's responsibility to bring t back in stock and secondly who else shall I contact to know about the book? 

This is the first and hopefully the last time I came across such a situation otherwise I really like Amazon! 
Plus its super safe for your transactions!",4,“My shopping destination!”

1450,"I've been an Amazon Prime member for years, and up until recently I've been 100% satisfied with it. Recently, Amazon has started using something called ""Share Post"" for their shipments and it sucks.  They ship UPS to the local Post Office and drop the shipments so the post office will be responsible for the remainder of the delivery. I guess it's cheaper, but I recently had 5 different shipments get lost in that process.  For people who live on rural routes, you can't use the street address which is required by UPS; instead you have to list the PO box because the post office doesn't do home delivery in certain areas.

It wouldn't be such a big deal if, during the ordering process, there was a disclaimer notifying the buyer which form of delivery was being used.  That way the proper address (street or PO Box) could be listed and there wouldn't be this confusion.",4,“Convenient shopping but need more transparency on shipping”

1459,"I have made numerous purchases from retailers on Amazon with mostly quite positive experiences - products shipped/received on time and as advertised. My only criticism is minor - that is, when a problem is experienced, there is a very short character limit for the review, so that it is not possible to enter a detailed account of any problem with one of their retailers. Thankfully, I've had only one problem worth providing a negative review over the last several years of purchases.",4,“Mostly good experiences”

1462,"I reported a seller for selling an imitation product.  My review disappeared.  After some reasearch, I find that sellers can remove negative reviews, with no notification to the reviewer.

So, seller ratings are meaningless on Amazon.  Buyer beware.",4,“Third party sellers can quietly delete negative reviews”

1497,"i'd been ordering from amazon (UK) constantly for years until last summer. since last summer most of my orders are being automatically canceled due to transaction delays. i don't know if it's only exclusively amazon's fault, it might also be my bank's fault. But it's really annoying that both have no idea why my payments are being declined.",4,"“sometimes its perfect, other times it's a real pain” "
1498,"Pros
1) Amazon Prime offers free 2-day shipping for many products.
2) Amazon Prime offers some free music and movies.
3) Amazon Prime offers free returns for some items and the return methods are hasslefree.

Did you notice something? Yeah, Amazon rocks when you have Prime membership. However, the membership fee is high.

Cons:
1) Sometimes 2-day shipping fails to deliver in two days.
2) Amazon Prime only offers very limited choices for free music and movies, considering the membership fee.
3) Amazon Prime does not cover free returns for all Prime eligible items. For instance, I needed an immune boost product when I was very sick, but the item was delivered on the third day. I couldn't wait and got something else. However, the item delivered was not eligible for free returns.
4) There are more and more products on Amazon that are sold and shipped by sellers in China. The quality of these items is very questionable most of the time, and the shipping time is ridiculously long. I'm not saying we shouldn't purchase anything from China, but that being said, at least it should have a filter function for buyers to choose. I purchased a fall dress for my daughter and it didn't tell me where the item will be shipped from nor give me a tracking number, so I waited for over a month (already lost track of time since it took too long -- maybe 5~6 weeks) to receive it. The weather was already winter-like around Thanksgiving, so I don't see the point of keeping the dress as my daughter will outgrow it very soon. Bummer!!
5) The search engine of Amazon fails to deliver only the results you want -- it somehow gives a lot of junks when crossing your key words, and I don't know why. On the contrary, I feel eBay does a better job on this.
6) Amazon should make itself more visible on Google shopping if its search engine has flaws. It is very frustrating to be not able to find the real products neither from Amazon nor Google shopping.

Due to the reasons above, I'm giving 3 or 4 stars for Amazon.",4,“Good only when you have Prime” 
1499,"Always a fan of Amazon, I think I primarily use it to keep a huge wishlist of books. When ordering, it's always swift and easy, and deliveries always arrive in good shape.",4,“Reliable” 
1500,"Absolutely love Amazon and all of the variety of products they have to offer, beware of one-click ordering without checking competitors pricing. At the same time I love their subscribe and save as the pricing usually beats any local competitor.

I will no longer Buy chargers, cables or cases for any technology through any third-party seller due to the crazy amount of knock-offs and subpar items on amazon.com.",4,"“One stop shop, watch pricing and third party sellers. Amazon customer care is awesome!” "
1501,"My only gripe with Amazon is raising the minimum purchase for free shipping to $45.  Sometimes I just want a few things that are less than that, and I don't buy them at all because of the shipping costs.  Amazon's loss...

Then on the other side, the best thing ever was getting an amazon.com rewards credit card.  I stopped paying cash as often, just to get more reward points, and they really add up.  It is SO nice to order some things on Amazon, and then not have to pay anything at all!  You cannot beat that with a stick, as they say.

Ordering things online at Amazon, at usually the best or really close price, with free shipping, is really good for me, as I really do live out in the ""sticks"", and it is a bit of a drive to shop for anything.  I must say at least 4 plus stars!",4,"“Only one gripe, otherwise really great!” "

1505,"You can get any and everything on Amazon.  It's so convenient! Inaturally I was happy to have the ability to order groceries.

I called to ask how they retrieved them and I was told ""they would pick them up when they brought 2nd delivery"", but that delivery person said he didn't pick them up, someone else would.  So I called, and with a heartfelt apology the customer service representative said she would have someone pick them up in 2 days. Lol A week later I called and I was told to just leave them out by the mailbox.  Well, good riddens big Green containers.  I'm not sure what company delivers the products but they will  leave them, drop them over the fence and they never require a signature.  I'll still shop on amazon.

I've had a few issues with their in-house delivery company, and a few with their outside sellers (I've bought and reordered compression socks that should all be the same size but aren't), but they've usually handled the problems expeditiously.    I do think that they boost the prices of their Prime merchandise to compensate for the 'free' shipping, and being Prime no longer seems to necessarily still mean 2-day shipping, but I decided to accept that.",4,"“Mostly good, but can be expensive..” "

I am disappointed that some items wont be shipped to Australia that can be bought here at an obvious large profit for local sellers, and those that can when I see the shipping cost most times I decline to make a purchase.

1568,I want you to thoroughly read my review before down voting it leaving a negative comment. No doubt Amazon is one of the finest online shopping stores. Flipkart and Amazon are two where most of the times I can blindly take their offers and buy their products. But sometimes you will come across the product details that are too good to be true. Especially when you are browsing through their Electronics section. For example Mobile Phones. You might see some cellphones with epic specification and at a very cheap price. Beware on Amazon many sellers tend to update wrong information(Not sure if they do it intentionally or they just copy paste information from some unreliable sources) I have seen it and I know sometimes if you don't do some research at your end you might end up getting a low-spec cellphone which was advertised with too many power components and features. Other than that Amazon is awesome. So be careful while you buy a cellphone and you must double check specification before you place your order to avoid disappointment.,4,“Sometimes it's too good to be true” 
1569,Helpfully cheap endless supplies,4,“Quick easy” 
1570,its good,4,“satisfied” 
1571,"Amazon offers great online shopping, however the prices are often a little bit high on apparel. Great and trustworthy place to buy electronics from. Just make sure you read the reviews on the sellers and the reviews on the product as well as the details.",4,“Normally great service” 
1572,I needed a printer cartridge and a couple of other stuff.  I was able to order and get it delivered the same day -- without a HUGE surcharge for the convenience.  Great!,4,“Got it delivered the same day.” 
1573,"I have 2 major problems with Amazon and those are:
1:  I am an Amazon Prime member yet I pay 100$(basically) to be so while they do promotions for new people to join for half the rate.  I believe Prime members should get a deal from that as well.  We've been loyal to Amazon and it is unfair to charge newbies way less than we pay yearly.  Maybe they could lower or give a small/whatever refund for those promotions to current Amazon Prime members.
2:  Another Prime issue.  I'm paying so much for Prime, but I can't watch my films in HD because they won't change their player.  It's so annoying to watch shows in standard when you're paying for HD and I'm not going to switch to other browsers every time I want to watch a show that happens to be on Amazon.
3:  (Not a MAJOR issue, but an issue none-the-less.  Amazon seems to be very pricey and just to keep getting more and more so even for Prime members.  Usually what's on Amazon, I can get MUCH cheaper on Ebay or some other site.
4:  Please check the reviews people give for items and movies because some times they are NOT reviewing the item, but the seller.  This totally ruins the review value.  I can't trust the overall review because some idgit is saying ""they sent the box to me bent""....that has ZERO to do with the product at hand.  Someone really needs to get on that one.

Pluses and why it got a 4 star:  
1:  The free shipping is awesome.  I love not having to deal with that.  
2:  The majority of the time their customer service is excellent...like the best.  Only one time did I have to deal with a bad one and I just went to another one and they fixed my problem pronto. 
3:  It has a lot of Prime freebies that I love (but it could stand to make some more of it's movies and TV shows free for Prime Members).
4:  It's pretty easy to navigate.
5:  I bought a 6 cartridge litter box from members on the site two times and I was sent ONLY ONE two times....Amazon refunded me and let me keep the one that I did get instead of forcing me to go through the trouble of sending it back when it was a huge error on the side of the seller and the boxes are quite large.  It would've been too much of a waste of my time.  I paid over 70$ each time for 6 boxes.",4,"“It Is Great, But It Could Be Amazing” "

1600,"I have Amazon Prime and it makes shopping on this website even better. I occasionally compare deals on Amazon and eBay, and retail stores to see which have better prices. Sometimes, Amazon isn't the most inexpensive, but if there's a situation that an item is, the Prime Shipping is extremely useful. The customer service is very helpful. It's overall a very friendly experience and extremely easy to use. There are some minor things I'd like to mention:

1. Pet Items: Maybe not just this category, but there are items that cannot be returned with no explanation. When I called up customer service, a CSR told me that some items ""just can't be returned"" even if the return policy never said anything about that. I asked him if there's a way to tell (for next time) and he tells me ""no"". Why? That's just strange and inconvenient.

2. Seller: If you think Amazon is more generous to you than eBay as a seller, they're not. They have their own policy to refund buyers for any reason just like eBay. Fees are not much less, although it depends on the category. Ebay is just a flat 15% (plus Paypal fees), so Amazon may win on the fee calculations. But, don't expect all buyers to be reasonable as I realize Amazon customers assume that there are no third-party sellers and are often impatient, demanding and hostile when there's an issue; even more hostile than eBay buyers.

3. There really should be a non-Add-On and a non-Amazon Fresh price. I wanted to purchase two different items that were only Add-On and Amazon Fresh. No other listing offers it even if it meant raising the price. Really disappointing; I wouldn't have mind to pay extra.

4. Two-Day Prime Shipping does NOT include the handling time, which can range anywhere between 1-5 days. I purchased an item that took 5 days to ""handle"" and then two days Prime shipping.

Honestly, I could get amazing prices for certain items on Amazon, and best of all, some retail stores price-match if its shipped and sold by Amazon. I have used this website consistently every month for random purchases. There are really good prices and other times, maybe not so much. Its definitely worth having around.",4,“Good Website”

I like not having to go to a store - or several - to get what I need.  I like the fast delivery rates and the subscription services for things I need regularly.  My ONLY complaints, which is why it's only 4 stars instead of 5, are (1) they seriously waste a LOT of supplies packing small items in large boxes and not combining orders to a single address and (2) over the past two years, the rate of errors, non-delivery, and defective items has increased dramatically.  I realize that it is due to the volume but, given that, I think they need to re-visit their return and replacement policies because its become very hard to get replacements and/or refunds when something goes wrong for most of the things I buy.

I can't watch prime videos, movies because of my location and I always pay the yearly subscription fee which is quite hefty.

I like their ""prime"" service since it includes a large variety of things and their ""prime"" service means i will get what I want quickly. It sometimes is not as fast a promised, but those occasions are rare. Sometimes tracking a package takes a few extra steps because it starts with one carrier and ends up with the postal service in the end.

Amazon often cannot answe the questions. Some items i have bought have had a defect or design fault but despite reporting this they still contiue to sell them. Despite this i have always received a prompt refund if needed. Occasionally ive had problems with cost of postage which were supposedly free delivery. Amazon say this is to do with being a market place or amazon product or the totall has to be over a certain amout. This could be made s lot clearer. The default setting should also be for free standard delivery and allow you to change to more urgent if required.,4,“Generally a good experience”

It took me a while and also had to provide the law and they finally refunded the full amount.   

For the most part I have had good luck, and not to many issues with needed to use refunds or replacement.  

I have noticed of late the prices on some of the products are far more expensive than many brick and mortar stores, so check prices before you buy on Amazon.  I still check reviews out of products I am interested in.

1648,"i buy a lot of stuff from this site, but i find more often then not the shipping is the most irritating process. especially now that you have to buy $49 worth of stuff to get free shipping. 

when you order something, i find when its free shipping, that it will often take an entire week before they get around to ordering it and sending it. i live near a hub, i should be able to get it all much faster. i'm certain they do this to make the prime look better, but i think that's over priced. unless i'm shipping bags of cement and tires, i don't think i'll ever get to a $100 in shipping. 

another thing is the cart, while it will hold your items forever, if its out of stock, it kicks it out, i've almost forgotten to order important things because it did do that. and when it does do that, and you add it back to the cart, it may not be from the same company. it might be more money, or it may be used (as one item they sent me was).

searching is becoming much harder, it finds things i never typed in. i would rather see - we could not find that exact item, here are some things related to it. but more times than not it will show totally random things. they use titles as keywords, and many people spam them.

they allow reviews from anyone - even people who never bought it - always make sure it says - verified, or you may be seeing a fake review.

they do have a great refund policy though, they have come through each time. but its tricky to find their contact some times.

It's better than driving 80 miles round trip to the nearest city and run to 3-4 stores only to find they don't have what I'm looking for in the price range I'm willing to spend.

I do not like what I am reading about how they treat their employees. As a former employer I know that the bottom line is not the only measuring stick of a business. I won't shop at WalMart because of their unethical business practices. If Amazon continues down this path of employee exploitation I may have to look elsewhere to shop. We vote with our dollars and approval of unethical business practices should not be tolerated.",4,“Great place to shop for almost everything. Concerned about their employee practices.”

So, Amazon may well be headed in the same downward commercial spiral Google and ebay are going down in.

My only negatives are that not everything is available via Prime, and Amazon is definitely NOT always the most economical option...but you pay for the convenience of having things delivered to your door, I guess. 
My other issue is with selling books on Amazon. I've done this for several years with little problems, but recently, I listed a pair of books that were brand new, but had been at a bookstore for a long time and never sold. The ISBN showed the publishing date, and I stated the year of publication in the listing details. Both books dealt with professional photography, and the contents were still valid. The buyer got all bent out of shape about the fact that books were older (although they were brand spanking new) and complained to Amazon...who found in his favor. He got his money back, and was to return the books to me, but he never did that, and Amazon did nothing about it. Seems they're like eBay, and all about the buyers, but want to do nothing for sellers.",4,“Pretty close to perfect for me”

1700,"I have found the reviews and the review system on Amazon to be a great help in understanding many products and services.  If I take the time to read what regular people have to share, I usually always learn something new and useful.  The problem with the internet is that it is a bottomless pit of raw info and has very little context and wisdom is hard to find.   Without wisdom, we are all shooting in the dark. 

The availability of real user reviews and people's real opinions, as various as they are, is a small ray of light in a dark forest.   Since everyone sees things from a different perspective, it is often difficult to weed out the truth about something, but if you read enough comments, sometimes patterns start to emerge.   No other company offers as much depth in actual user comments, although this site, sitejabber, is a notable exception.
People have wisdom and most people are decent.   If all companies allowed us the freedom to exchange our honest experiences, and the software would allow us to search a little better and also to collate the results, it would be a good day for consumers and a bad day for ruthless companies selling low quality trash.   So my Hat is off to Amazon.  There is a reason most people use them and that is because they are the most reputable company out there.   If other companies followed their example, it would be a better world.",4,"“regarding Amazon reviews, not all it could be, but the best out there.” "

Twice, though, they said something was coming from over seas, and it turned out to come from the states. Which is good for me, because it didn't take as long to get to me as stated. Bad for the stores because I almost cancelled my orders seeing how long it was going to take.  Great return policy. However, I do not like having to pay return shipping for UPS, especially since I can get it free to ship back. There should be that option of doing it yourself.",4,“Able to find hard to find stuff”

The thing is I have frequent family visits so I buy things on the U.S. site and have stuff brought down. Their international shipping rates aren't bad either if I need something ""now"" but quite a few things they won't ship to Mexico.

The one thing that pisses me off is I have to use my family's credit cards as my credit cards are Mexican and are in pesos. Amazon gives very unfair exchange rates when they convert from U.S. dollars to Mexican pesos.

Only two points of improvement for Amazon India:
1) Many of the prices on your site are so obnoxiously, ridiculously high. I'm talking about pricing something that sells in the US for $10 (~600 rupees) at Rs.20,000. I waste time on your site because so many of the products I want are at these ""scammy"" prices. Ruins the whole shopping experience and makes me feel like I'm in some cheap fake marketplace full of scamsters look to swindle customers.

1790,"I have never made a better decision about something, I just had to come back and share. Before I bumped into Glestore Men's 3-pack Modal Soft Boxer. I was looking for something that could enable me to be free and yet give me assurance that I'm totally covered- you know, without having to remind me I'm carrying a package when I walk and this babie right here was designed just for that! I have to admit that the quality is at its best, the design that takes the body's nature, not to mention the price. They had all these different sizes and colours to choose from so i didn't have to try so hard to find something ideal. With a smart combination of 95% Modal and 5% spandex the absorption capacity is quite high, even higher than cotton fiber which is about 50%, i have done a couple of wears but so far not felt suffocated or soaked, even during my work-outs they have proven to be breathable, this definitely spells quality and for me to place my wallet on a product, there has to be some good quality in it.

These underwear have been nothing short of comfortable, and quite soft which is a great feeling not having to be coursed by rough jeans, they are also slim fit and can be worn under any material. Though I'm kind of wondering what you had in mind for us with this product because it falls more on the sexy side which is a plus anyway, because either way you look good both with and without pants. They also cover a good section of the thigh and in them I don't even feel close to naked. It's almost like wearing a second skin but with a good fitting for your junk, meaning good chocolate with a good wrapper.

The waist is another thing that really got points from me, it's firm but not too tight and the fitting's perfect especially around the groin. I have bought a few different brands before that I won't mention here for obvious reasons but some of them actually make you feel like you're wearing a female swimsuit--and sadly, I kid you not. I have seen far more expensive brands, this kind of explains why a lot of females have a notion on men scratching their 'groins' publicly, the itching comes as a result of wearing underwear that's too tight which would obviously bring that region too close to the body, which should not happen anywhere in the face of the universe-no really, it shouldn't. This also does not mean they should be let to hang free for reasons best known to us. All men irrespectable of their social standing, lifestyle, political power, age or.. or.. forget it, deserve good quality, well-fitting underwear and the Glestore Mens 3-pack modal Soft Boxer provided just that for me.

In my experience-that is; since I started buying underwear on my own which is a long while, i have so far not found few that can compete with the comfort of your everyday wear of Glestore Mens 3-pack Modal Soft Boxer. At first I tried this brand out with a 1-pack but it obviously didn't take long to purchase the 3-pack. One thing that probably sucks about my life is that I actually don't have enough time for some of these little but time consuming chores so I was very glad it turned out to be machine washable, (can't do it most of the time) but presumably just a few machine washes and mostly hand washing we'll do, but that definitely worked for me.

These days it's very rare to get anything good with an affordable price tag but your prices are like hitting the jackpot, the average cost of the Glestore Mens 3-pack Modal Soft Boxer ranges from about $6 to $9 on average. I found this price very fair to say the least and this partly gave me all the more reason to buy these superior undies. The return policy for some sizes is quite cool if for example someone bought a pair or more but the wearer was not present or aware during purchase, I guess they'd most certainly have to be unsealed at return but nevertheless I'm glad I went shopping around and discovered something different and unique. This product is the best bet you have in the male category and I will definitely be making future purchases if you keep both the quality and the price unbeatable.

Hope my words can help you guys to find your style.
Thank you.",4,“Glestore Mens 3-Pack Modal Soft Boxer Briefs”

My storage space is running low and since all of the above mentioned items had previously been read/listened to as a medical condition reduces the amount of time I can read. printed text.  Unfortunately, every inquiry that was sent Amazon (about permanently deleting the books) has been sent to Audible who has no idea how to remove the content.  My only option at this point would be to delete my Kindle Fire content completely and start from scratch -- that would entail my de-registering my Kindle Fire and re-purchasing the e-books, Audio-books, hypnosis and meditations that I still want and listen to.  This has been an ongoing inquiry for well over a month and I'm getting absolutely nowhere, prior to Audible's involvement in this ""immersion reading"" nonsense, there was no problem at all with managing my content myself through Amazon's web site.

I have seen some products being sold for more than they could be purchased elsewhere.

For example, I buy my health and wellness products direct from the manufacturer. People are selling the same products for 300% - 400% markup.  That's REDICUOUS!  

For example, I purchase a super high quality moisturizer for under $10.  The product has been clinically proven to be 7 times better at holding moisture than Eucerin.

What I love about Amazon too is that they are an online electronic department store where you can shop for computers, apparel, computers, books, DVD's and more.  Not only that you can also make money on Amazon by selling your services, sell your apps, become an affiliate, advertise your products, you can self-publish with them,  You can actually make money on Amazon.  The different ways I mentioned and more.  Isn't that awesome.

Another plus is that there are different ways of making payment for purchases with their payment products:  Awards Visa card, store card, corporate credit line, you can also shop with points, they have their credit card marketplace and they also have currency converter. They cater to the needs of everyone.

Amazon provides products and services, services in the form of employment not only for those they employ in their immediate circle but for everyone else who take advantage of the services they offer.  Whether you want to self-publish with them, become an affiliate, advertise your products or become and Amazon vendor, and there are more to choose from.

Most of the time I'm, not in the market, for the business that they are keeping me informed about.  Result:  An unending slew of unsolicited e mails about businesses in my area that I am mostly, not in the market for, when I receive their e mail.  If they could stay in touch with you quarterly, send a brief questionnaire about what you might be looking for, in the next few months, travel, tires, electronics.  The constant receipt of e mails ruins the experience.  Lighten up Amazon, I know you're there and a lot of local business are affiliated.  I'll let you know when I need them, or give me a chance to let you know what I'm looking for, just don't bomb me with ads about local merchants.  It ruins the experience.",4,“A great web site that should stay great by allowing you to contact them instead of them contacting u”

I've learned never buy before reading reviews, especially the 1 ratings. If it's a $15 item for $5, it's going to be cheaply made and useless. Not everything is cheaper on Amazon or worth getting by delivery. Make sure you really want the item or it's worth paying to return if you hate it. Having Amazon Prime is totally worth the membership if you make regular purchases and watch a lot of online shows/movies. Finally, Amazon Prime gives you free shipping but NOT free returns.

But that last little bit is when there's a minor gaff which can be fixed easily but that fix is not in their playbook.  And there's no way to get a message to a customer service person.

Example is a while ago I bought an item which was battery operated (included!) and fairly large.  It was also packaged in one of those terrible blown plastic things but nobody noticed that the included batteries, easily visible in the online photos and indeed through the plastic, had been pilfered.  The main product was ok but I knew they would send replacement batteries if I could just let them know.  But no way to communicate that.  So I swallowed the cost of a couple of batteries.  I know, not a big deal but what if it had been some larger problem but just as simple to fix?",4,“One Major Flaw”

1940,"Amazon usually does things right the first time.  However recently my husband ordered a grooming arm for my dog grooming table which was supposed to come with a clamp.  The clamp was missing.  I didn't pay attention because I have a shorter arm that has the same clamp, so I just used that.  When I realized my new dog is going to need both arms for grooming I asked him to order me a clamp and he said ""didn't the new one come with a clamp? It was supposed to!""  So sure enough, it was, and we had to file a request for a replacement.  The thing is, all the seller would have had to do is send us the clamp.  But instead the Amazon return/exchange process wasted money by sending us a whole new one and shipping the one with missing parts back.  Why?  If this is how Amazon is doing things it is totally wasting people's money.  Sure it didn't cost me and didn't inconvenience me except that they showed up to pick up the one I already had, two days before the replacement came, and we said no, you have to bring us the replacement first!   But the cost for all this extra freight from such an odd process goes into the system and applies to prices across the board.  Just send me the parts I need from one you already have, and defect THAT one of yours out.  There has to be a way to eliminate waste there.",4,“Kind of an odd exchange policy”

I use them all the time still for the discounts.  Some of the prices aren't what they used to be, and shipping has gotten stupid expensive, if you want a package faster, than normal bulk delivery.

1954,"Update: I have changed my rating to 4 stars. Over the past (almost 4) years, I have seen Amazon go downhill. Shipping and returns remain excellent in most cases. Merchandise: has become more questionable and prices have skyrocketed. (Lookout for Outlet items in particular. Many are found on wish.com. Check it out). Clothing is super hard to pin down for quality unless you search for a particular brand. Off-brands permeate the site (when using just search parameters) with skewed sizes and questionable quality. Prices: I've seen stuff at DOUBLE the price of other online retailers (take a look at sparkling water for one). I don't use Prime anymore. It's not worth it to me. I've been a Prime member for years.  I love it. I order anything from toothpaste to televisions. I only order Prime unless it's a special item. No shipping pays for itself within in the first few shipments. I furnished my entire apartment using Amazon. Very few times (out of literally hundreds) have been disappointing.  My only caution:  Like any other store, online or otherwise, be careful of ignoring regular or higher prices lurking among all item types. Check Walmart.com for prices on items just to be sure the free Prime shipping is not costing your more in item price.  Also, love the Amazon Prime streaming video for movies and TV series. Walmart is supposed to add a similar shipping program on a pilot-program basis. We'll see.",4,“Update to: There really isn't a bad thing to say about Amazon”

1967,"We are continually impressed with Amazon's ability to provide stellar customer service and their Prime systems are a great value to all of us that shop online on a regular basis. We always go to the Amazon site first to see what they charge to gauge deals others are offering. We've seen people trying to sell used stuff on Craigslist for more than buying a new one would cost on Amazon! Even if you don't shop at Amazon, just them being there with their low prices, great customer service and Prime shipping, has forced other online and brick and mortar retailers to lower their prices or up their act, so kudos to them for that, if nothing else!

All this having been said, they have one nagging and frustrating unacceptable issue. If you place a lot of orders they start combining them and shipping them separately and then charges with mystery dollar amounts start showing on your charge card statement that don't show up in your order history. So, then you have to call them and they explain that these two orders were combined or we did this and that and we're sorry they don't show up in your order history as they do on your credit card statement.

One issue that I have run into is when an item is no longer made by a manufacturer.  Amazon sometimes will advertise the replacement item using the product description for the old product.  If you want the replacement product fine.  But, if the replacement product is inferior to the original you will have a problem.  Sellers run into the same problem.  They aren't given the means to advertise the new product.  They have to advertise the replacement item using the old item description.  

As a seller they hold you to selling a quality product and making sure you get it shipped on time.  You must also provide a way for the customer to track their order.

The complaints I have with them as a seller is that it can be a nightmare to get all of your information on the correct screens.  The screens aren't the most user-friendly.  And if you don't get all of your information down you won't be paid in a timely manner.",4,“Very Pleased”

What is a little unsettling is when you don't pay the extra to get it tomorrow the order sits for a couple of days then it gets placed and I receive it the next day after that.

Once you order whatever, you immediately get an E-mail verifying what you've ordered, and periodically another E-mail advising when the item will be (approximately) delivered.  They have some items that are overpriced  - and I choose carefully in those cases - but overall I like shopping at Amazon.  Especially when I want something specific & I don't want to drive all over to find it.  I recommend shopping with them; and paying for the item thru Paypal.   I have found various amazing items at Amazon that were no longer available thru regular channels. I would definitely recommend checking into Amazon when you want to buy something & cannot find it wherever you now live.",4,“Amazon - they seem to 'have it all'”

The one thing I really don't like though, is that if you have Prime - as we did for while_ the shipping cost is actually built into the price of the item, making it harder to know if you got a good deal on said item or not.  We ascertained this by doing internet searches on the same item using several sellers - ebay, Froogle, overstock, etc. and comparing them to Prime items on Amazon. I was surprised at what I found - that shipping seemed to be included in the price on Amazon.  So buying into Prime isn't always such a good idea - maybe it's better to price-shop a bit and be patient with longer shipping times.",4,“A longtime customer.

2210,"I love Amazon. I think it's better than eBay most of the time. With Amazon I can get all kinds of great CDs, DVDs and video games for really low prices. What I like better about this than eBay, is with eBay you have to compete for everything and the infamous eBay Snipers almost always win. Plus eBay sellers are allowed to add little stipulations to auctions that contractually force the would-be-buyer to agree to in order to make a purchase. With Amazon, none of that is a problem because they don't let it work that way. The ONLY things I have to say negative about Amazon is that the sellers can't combine shipping prices which means if you buy 2 or more CDs from a seller, and they only have to spend $3 to ship them, you still have to pay $2.98 for shipping, for each CD. So the shipping on Amazon can you from a cart sub-total value of $5 and you end up with a $30 total. I also with sellers had to leave feedback for buyers as well. But with the way Amazon buying works it really doesn't matter. That's my ONLY gripe with Amazon. Other than that 1 thing they kill eBay in every single category you can think of. I talk to Amazon reps via-chat anytime I need an answer. Good luck contacting eBay reps!!!

One big thing you need to look at is who you are ordering to product from. yes you are on Amazon but websites/manufacturers post there products on the site and you are really buying from them not always Amazon. So when your product comes late or you where over charged Amazon is not at fault. When you go to order something it will say where you are ordering the product from. If you have had a bad experiences with a product than you know not to order from that manufacturer again. If you don't pay attention to the site you order it from its your fault not Amazon.

I ordered a product and never received it after two months i went to amazon and wrote a bad review on the product and the manufacturer of the product called me two days later asking me to take down the bad review and they would mail me the product.

Amazon is VERY effective because it cares of customers. They ensure delivery, provide promotions, and offer a variety of products for purchasing. While the website may seem intimating at first, if you know what you're looking for, its not a problem at all!

2227,"As movie stores, such as Blockbusters and Movie Galleries, are becoming slim to none in existence, many people have resorted to online options to watch movies. Many people prefer the online option to view their movies because it is often times free or cheaper than renting one at a store. Also having to be home or near a tv at the exact time your favorite tv series airs its newest episode is no longer an issue with these web 2.0 tools since they have both movies and tv episodes for their users. This instant availability has definitely been a major pro for users and is probably one of the main reasons movie stores are going out of business. 
I found three web 2.0 sites that people can use to watch their favorite tv shows and movies. I took into account the websites' affordability, accessibility, reliability, and more to create my reviews. Amazon's instant videos are very easy to navigate. There is a search bar and also categories to make it easier for the user to find what they are looking for. Another pro is that the prices for each movie or tv episode is clearly displayed. Amazon Prime is an option the site offers in which you can become a Prime member for $79 a year which allows you to have access to thousands of free movies and episodes that are have no additional fee as compared to having to make a purchase each time you decide to use Amazon instant videos. A major con is that there are no free options to this site and that there must be some kind of purchase made before watching an episode or movie. However the cost is relatively cheap and affordable.

2233,"Always the go-to place when shopping. A few small issues remain such as sorting by price which basically doesn't work, and also searches tend to bring up many not so relevant results. They also collect sales tax in New York. My note about sales tax follows:

Amazon COLLECTS sales tax; they do not CHARGE sales tax. Even if Amazon would not collect it, you would still be obligated by law to pay. It's just that no one actually does and so the states are going after the sellers to collect. Most states will have a section on the tax return where the taxpayer is supposed to indicate the amount of goods purchased for which no sales tax was paid - and then pay the tax.

The issue is that if a seller does not have nexus in a certain state, they can basically tell the state to shove off since the state has no jurisdiction over them. The state would then have the option of banning the company from doing business there but then would run the risk of having the Interstate Commerce Commission come afer them, not to mention violating Federal and possibly even Constitutional laws.

It basically comes down to a game of chicken between the states and the companies where the state tries to show that the company has nexus there and the company tries to show that it doesn't. Amazon is the biggest target due to its size and potential tax revenue to the states. They gave in to New York and is slowly caving in to other states. This will go on until the Federal Government gets involved and Congress passes some type of law governing the collection of sales tax. Or a case may make it to the Supreme Court with the same effect.",4,“Always the go-to place when shopping”

Also, amazon is even better with the PRIME (esp the 2 day shipping for free) service offered to college students for a year free!!",4,"“As everyone already knows, very reliable website with...” "
2256,"I love Amazon.com. I have been buying from them for the past 10 years and have not have much problems. Sure, once in a blue moon I get a wrong item, but I think it was only like twice in 10 years, still a very good record! I love that they have a lot of variety and other buyers to buy it from. From books to lotion, almost anything you can think of. But the best part for me is that if I ever want a good product review, I can just go on Amazon, search if they have it, and then read the reviews of other users. It has saved me many times from making the wrong decision! 

Buying from the individual sellers can be more tricky, not all of them ship as fast and you don't get the free shipping plus they make more mistakes in shipments than Amazon do. It is especially a problem when you are ordering multiples of the same item. Sometimes the sellers charge you the shipping fee per item. Meaning $4.99 per hand lotion, but if you buy 2 bottles, they will charge you $4.99 x 2, which then adds up to be a lot. Sometimes the shipping can negate any savings that you will get and it may be better to buy from other sites. 

   But I like the fact that Amazon will refund your money eventhough the seller ignores you after you have returned the wrong or defective item, as long as you have proof of delivery or some kind of delivery confirmation of course. Plus, even the sellers have ratings like ebay, so they make more effort to offer better customer service to avoid getting dinged on ratings. 

  Overall a great site!",4,“I love Amazon.com”

2261,"I have had an account with Amazon.com for about 7 years. Generally, I buy books, CD. LP's and camera and binoculars from them. They offer a wide selection of merchandize, and a buyer to listen to samples of CD tracks before they buy They also good checkout and cart system. E-mail annoucements are almost daily and informative, I don't like their system of shipping rates enforced on their sellers's which can be as expensive as the new or used item you are buying. Shipping time by them or vedors is generally very slow and just terrible, You could wait as much a month if you chose ""standard"" shipping, and expedited shipping is tooo expensive. Amazon needs to strike a  ""volume"" of merchandize deal with USPS to ship everything at discounted and lower Priority Mail rates.

2269,"My fiancee and I routinely order all manner of goods from Amazon.com.  

First the pros:

1. Great selection: 

We've ordered everything from roto-tillers, books and MP3s to a garment bag for her wedding dress, all at prices that are better than nearly every reputable retail outlet.

2. Solid packaging: 

Unlike most sellers, we haven't run into any issues with damage due to inadequate protection in shipping.

3. Good Marketplace:

A wide variety of accredited sellers, giving you even more comparison and shopping power, all on one site.

Although the overall experience has been good, I have a few minor issues to note:

1.Beware free shipping:

This is kind of a crap-shoot.  Sometimes, you'll have your items in a few days, however, there is no rhyme or reason to what gets shipped in a timely fashion.  We've had an order of several books shipped from CA arrive in MA in two days, and we've had electronics shipped from KY take nearly 3 weeks to the same address.  If you need the items quickly, ignore the free shipping option, and decide if the cost to have the items shipped quickly offsets the slightly lower price.  For example, the last round of electronics was slightly cheaper, because of the free shipping, on amazon.com than on newegg.com, with newegg's shipping costs.  However, had we ordered them from newegg, we'd have had them in 3 days, and amazon to 20. 

2. Be careful with one-click ordering:

Although useful, and I think required to order MP3 files, make sure you shut this back off.  I accidentally pre-ordered a book using one-click, and didn't even realize it until the book showed up 2 months later!

3. Read the reviews of non-amazon sellers:

Although the marketplace is great, make sure you check into the reviews of any non-amazon seller on the site.  There are some shady sellers out there, but at least amazon leaves the bad reviews up, unlike some sites (Virgin Mobile and Beckett come to mind)",4,“My fiancee and I routinely order all manner of goods...” 
2270,"Amazon is ok, i bought from them expecting low prices and because i was rushed for time to purchase gifts during the winter holidays, i got all my items on time kind of, they arrived at different times due to that they have different vendors selling the products, so its not all coming from the same place at the same time. Also the pricese seemed reasonable until of course it added up with shipping, and i saw the same products at my local target two days later at a cheaper price, what a let down.",4,"“Amazon is ok, i bought from them expecting low prices...” "
2271,"There are some things I like about this site, and other things I don't like. 

A while ago, I bought some books from amazon. One book never arrived. The company I bought it from just said that they had shipped it, so I couldn't get a refund. The book never arrived. 

Amazon was unwilling to get involved. They just told me to talk with the seller. Different reviewers get different community ratings, but it is still sometimes risky. Amazon doesn't accept any liability.

I do like that they have movies you can download instantly. You can rent or buy. Itunes takes forever to download, so this is a great alternative. I use netflix, but you can't watch everything instantly on netflix. I wish though that amazon made it easier to search their database. It is a bit difficult to navigate.

All in all, they have some good services. I would be careful though buying from 3rd parties.",4,"“There are some things I like about this site, and other...” "
2272,"Amazon has an enormous selection, and is very reliable. However, I have two main issues with it:
1. Shipping outside the U.S. is unbelievably expensive, especially considering how long it takes the products to arrive. It sometimes doubles (!) the price of your purchase.

2274,"most of times are good, will continue to buy from it",4,"“most of times are good, will continue to buy from it” "
2275,"I usually don't order from other merchants that sell on amazon, it's just too much of a hassle (plus the shipping is more expensive). I order directly from amazon because I think it's safer and cheaper (I aim for the free shipping).

I've ordered from Amazon since 2006, and I usually order books for my classes. They ship pretty quickly. My shipments usually arrive about 3-4 days (at most a week) after I order. I always try to get their free shipping by ordering over $25, but right now I have the prime account (free for students) w/amazingly fast shipping.

My one complaint is that if you send a present & don't opt to have it wrapped, they put the note in the box with the present. I thought the note would be a sticker on the box, but it's not. By the way, their shipping is through Fedex.

2279,"1. Video On Demand: they are trying to compete with netflix/itunes/etc, but here is the problem...while they do have a great selection and reasonable prices the quality of the video cannot even begin to compare to that of netflix or itunes right now. Plus they somehow lack the ability to buffer the video, so if your connection slows during playback the entire video stops. This never has happened to me on netflix or itunes. Did I mention this was on a T1 line? They give you the option to download the movie to your PC if the connection is too slow, but here is the catch, if you started watching the video already you have to pay AGAIN to download the video. So make sure you test out their connection before you pay for their VOD services, my T1 line was too slow for them. I give them a meh rating as of 12/2010 but hope in the future they get their act together. They  clearly rolled this out before it was ready in hopes to gain market share of the VOD services.

Their prices may not always be the best, their customer service is top notch.  You know that you're 100% protected from ""not as advertised"", ""defective"", ""simply not happy with the item/s ordered"" or even ""late or no delivery"".  The CSR's are friendly and the company really values customer satisfaction.  Their selection is staggering too. Like other large online vendors, they're struggling with fake reviews but they acknowledge it and are working towards resolving this issue....IF it can ever be completely resolved, seeing  as the fraudsters always find a ""workaround"".  Unfortunately, It's a never ending Cat and Mouse game.",5,“A satisfied customer”

2464,"Amazon is not my first pick when it comes to shopping but I do like that they offer the wish list option which is a great way to keep up with things that I am interested in wither its for buying later or just looking at things I find interesting. Generally I save things in wish lists to share with friends or family that I think might benefit from them. I really like that pretty much anything & everything I have ever ordered from Amazon as a normal member has come in really fast shipping wise. That can be hard to come by now days with many sites even more those who have special programs or membership like PRIME.

I can not rate the returns because I have never had to return anything. I have only been burned once but that was many years ago on an airbed that bubbled up after first sleeping on it which they claimed would never happen. Not a big deal, I am long over that now.

Would I recommend this site to a friend, stranger, family, etc?

2535,"It is 1914 in Hollywood and the craze there is the ""flickers"", silent motion pictures.  The biggest star is Mary Pickford, ""America's Sweetheart"".  With her long golden curls and the sweetest smiles, her fans adore her.  Mary has been sole support of her mother and siblings since she was 8 years old and she will do anything to keep her popularity and wrung on the ladder of success.  Never had time for a childhood, or an education, Mary has strong work ethics and is savvy in charming her powerful bosses who rule Hollywood.
When she meets Frances Marion, a ""wanna be writer"" for the Silver Screen, Mary tries to talk Frances into becoming an actress but fails.  They become close friends and form a personal and professional bond that lasts a lifetime.  They  become trailblazers fighting for women's rights in the film industry, and both achieve awards, power, the love of a lifetime,  and great wealth.

Mary Pickford married handsome mega-star, Douglas Fairbanks and they became the Royal Couple.  They lived at Pickfair, the elegant 18 acre estate in Beverly Hills.  They entertained often and lavishly but it was not the quiet, peaceful, together forever life, Mary dreamed of.  In the end, Mary lost Fairbanks and lived at Pickfair alone as a recluse.
Fran Marion, too, had the love of her life, marrying Fred until he passed away.  Fran became the highest paying screenwriter in Hollywood.

 A dedicated fan of Melanie Benjamin,  two of her books, ""THE AVIATOR'S WIFE;, and 'THE LAST CHRISTMAS IN PARIS', are two of my favorites..  Ms. Benjamin writes sterling historical fiction and her research is impeccable.  Films have always been of keen interest to me and GIRLS IN THE PICTURE is a riveting story that takes us both in front of the camera and behind the scenes with a candid description of the fascinating happenings of that era and the sensational people who lived it.  My admiration for both Mary Pickford and Frances Marion for never giving up but reaching the heights but not without heartbreak.  This book is highly recommended by me.  You will love it.  I did!

When I find a product I want to purchase, among all other sites, I add Amazon to the list. 9.5  times out of 10 they have the product at a lower price. Even if it's a few dollars more, I order from them because of superior customer service and return policy.
 The first action I take is reading the reviews of consumers who have purchased the  item to see if it's something I really want.. If that passes the test, I order with confidence knowing that Amazon stands behind every product they sell. I have purchased many items from them in the last 4 years. On several occasions the product was not what I expected or failed to perform. Each time, following the instructions given, I was able to return the item with a full refund. One time, because of a misunderstanding, Amazon even offered and sent me the product for free as an apology.

If I had an issue  I could walk in to the store and resolve my problem. Who knew how online stores would handle customer service. Well Amazon quickly sold me on online purchasing. Both of my kids and most of my grandkids are in other states. Anyone who who has tried to ship anything knows that shipping costs are outrageous. So I tried making a few purchases from Amazon. I always bought enough to get free shipping. I didn't have Prime at first. The first time I had to contact customer service I was so pleased with outcome I decided to stay with them. I'll give you an example of Amazon's customer service. I was given a Kindle Fire as a gift. It was purchased from a Major Electronic Chain Store. Within the first couple of weeks I started having an issue with it. I phoned the Major Electronic Chain Store and spoke to one of their customer service people. I explained the issue to her, giving her the date of purchase and the fact that I did have the receipt. Her response was that I would have to bring it in and if it was something covered under the warranty they would look as t it. But if not then I was pretty much SOL.  I had explained in detail to her what the issue was. It did not have anything to do with abuse of the Kindle. It had a clear operating issue. She just kept to the same not interested attitude.  I told her to not worry about it. I would call Amazon. But that I would never set foot in her store again again. To this day I have not. I did call Amazon. I made it very clear that the Kindle had been purchased from this other very unhelpful store. They did not care. They sent me a shipping label to return it to Amazon and as shipped me a brand new Kindle. Every time I have ever had to phone Amazon's customer service they have gone above and beyond to make sure that whatever issue I am having is solved. I do have Prime now and I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone. I can spend over a hundred dollars shipping one box to my kids. So the cost of Prime is a bargain. Not only do I have free shipping all year, but free books, movies, and all kinds of other things. I love this company.",5,“Every Business Should Be Run This Way!!!!” 
2561,"I've been shopping with Amazon for many years, and have recently become a Prime member.  99% of my shopping experiences have been positive, and the Prime pays for itself after a few orders!

2564,"Bought a refurbed phone that was supposed to be unlocked for my network.  Amazon help me try to officially unlock it and when that failed, they guided me to purchase another one for the same price and return the unworking one at their cost.  The 2nd phone arrived in similar condition and we were able to get it working, even though it was originally from another provider.  I was very frustrated before and pleasantly surprised after!",5,“Superb customer service”

2566,"They have the best customer service. My only issue is UPS tends to leave their packages randomly and I have experienced theft (not Amazon's fault). I had this happen and Amazon replaced the item.

I've had DOA items which they replaced on receipt of the item. Interestingly if it's a small low value item they let you keep the defective unit :) 

Nice people. My company had a business account and their business support is very responsive. (I'm sure regular support is great too).

Edit: I should probably mention they use something close to slave labor, with terrified employees peeing in bottles as they are afraid to take bathroom breaks. I'm not sure I want to shop with them, if this is the cost...

My only concern is they are supposedly treating staff badly. I would rather pay a bit more to know that staff are treated ethically and paid well.",5,“Amazon is awesome (but you knew that)”

I have shopped on-line with Amazon for over 10 years and their refund and/or return policy give buyers the assurance that what is advertised is what they get.

So for that I commend Amazon and will remain loyal. I love their platform and mobile app. The one issue I have with Amazon is the Prime Program. I was a Prime member in the past and it was okay but there was nothing too special. Honestly, I was just using it for 2 day shipping. However, most of my items ship within 2 to 4 days anyway. I really am not that desperate for something to arrive immediately. I also didn't use any of the other benefits like music, shows, books, etc. This is why Prime is a waste for most people. Unless you are going to use all the benefits, it may not be worth it. However, prime never played a major role on whether or not I shop on Amazon.",5,“A company I have become a fan of”

But not on my watch. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT FOR YOUR $ BACK. The same way they take it, it also can be released right then NOW! Their response is awesome.

2659,"Well, Amazon copes perfectly without my review, but I want to rate it anyway. The quickest and biggest online market!",5,“Do I need to say it? ;)” 
2660,"An absolutely first-rate company. Shipping is very fast! But if compare with the price, I would love to buy from Aliexpress.",5,“An absolutely first-rate company.” 
2661,"They back up their products and nobody gets ripped off.  High-quality products, rapid shipping, and wonderful customer service.  
check-out is also fast and easy.",5,“I LOVE IT.” 
2662,"I have been using Amazon for many years, and I must say that shopping with Amazon is not only convenient, but they usually have items found elsewhere at a lower price!! My daughter has Amazon Prime, and I think that this service is completely a worthwhile investment. Amazon Prime assures that usually anything marked with a ""Amazon Prime Symbol"" will ship to you in two days or less, and the shipping is completely free. Many of the Amazon Prime products for sale also come with ""Free Returns"". Let me explain. If you make a purchase with Amazon Prime, and the product is listed as ""Free Returns""........you have absolutely no risk in placing your order. When your order arrives with two-day free shipping, and it isn't what you thought it was, or it doesn't fit properly, you just request a return. This then takes you to a page to print out a shipping label for free return shipping of your order, with a refund quickly following the return. How can you beat that for worry-free online shopping??? The pricing on Amazon, on almost any product you can think of, is for the most part, less than purchasing from a brick and mortar store, and certainly less expensive than making your purchase on a different website!!! It pays to know your prices first....as Amazon is sometimes (rarely) the same price or a higher price than other competitors. I use traditional stores to go and touch and check-out an item.....then I go to Amazon to place my order for the same exact product at a substantial savings!!! Amazon is awesome!!! Don't just take my word for it......give it a try!!! Go with Amazon Prime......and if you are not happy with the pricing or service, Amazon will refund your Prime membership in full....no questions asked!!!! Furthermore, there are products on Amazon that you would never find for sale in a normal, run of the mill store. The variety of similar products gives you a wider choice of exactly what you want, and exactly what you don't want!!! For example, go to Home Depot to purchase an electrical meter. You may have two or three choices....that's it folks. Now, go onto Amazon.....type in electric meter....and you may happen to have anywhere from ten to fifty choices with complete descriptions and directions. And, I can almost guarantee that you can find an electric meter at a substantially lower price!!!!! Got to love it!!!!!!",5,“THIS IS THE PLACE TO BUY ALMOST ANYTHING!!!” 
2663,Love the fast shipped and customer service. My husband and i have been prime members for years we just love shopping there.,5,“Awesome company”

Every once in a while I need to return something and the process is a snap. !00% satisfied with products, pricing, fast delivery and customer service. Amazon is the best!",5,“I wish Amazon ran the Country”

2667,"I have loved shopping on Amazon for years because of Prime shipping (and free movies!), amount of selection and prices.  My favorite aspect, however, is customer service which cannot be topped!  I will forever be a loyal customer and count on Amazon for many things from tissue to furniture.",5,“Never dissatisfied!” 
2668,"I absolutely LOVE Amazon!!   I have an Amazon Business Prime account.
Better than ANY other online store for the variety of items available!. . .  95% of all my online purchases are with Amazon!

I used to shop on ebay--- years ago... Now I only shop there when I cant get what I want, at the price I want, on Amazon, or anywhere else.

I have never really had an issue with Customer Service. . . any time I have had an issue, they have always made it right, in one way or another.

I believe that people who have had issues with Customer Service, are due the fact that so many 3rd party sellers have problems with their products, and a lot of them offer discount coupons. . .   

And you have the Right to ask for a USA based Customer Service Rep.!
Or Ask to speak to a Supervisor!

Amazon will not refund your full purchase price, from 3rd party sellers, if you have used a coupon code... They will only refund the actual amount you paid. . . you have to contact the seller for the difference--- when you have to pay full price to re-order the item...",5,“Absolutely LOVE Amazon!!!”

I canceled within the hour, the $3.58 gift card balance was restored, but the completed transaction charge was not reversed and will not be reversed, because THREE CSRs have told me that it is not possible that I was charged, that it is just an authorization hold and will be removed when my bank's policies prescribe.",5,“sweet customer care”

You could not find any deals better then what they provide on the website. The ease of getting it shipped to me was also a bonus. Plus I was needed a lot of it in bulk and they were able to get it to me. It is a one stop shop for me. I just wanted to thank you for making something that could have been stressful not so bad. The other thing is I was able to save it into my cart and buy pieces at a time when I could afford it. Weddings although they are a wonderful time can be so stressful that you forget the joy and fun.

Always had great dealings with Amazon, as a third party or middle man to transactions the customer service has been excellent. They always try to make good any transaction. I have even had products gone missing and the odd posts disappear and Amazon have honored the deal. Look how big they are now.",5,“Online retailing juggernaut”

2764,"When I first got into amazon, I was skeptical about online shopping, But the way they treat customers and how easy the process is swayed me. I was first acquainted with the website after purchasing a kindle fire HDX 7 inch and have stuck with them for years. Not only is the process simple and fast, the customer service and warranty service is quick and hassle free. You can increase the speed of which your package arrives to you by either subscribing to amazon prime for free two-day shipping(along with other benefits) or you can increase it's speed by purchasing higher levels of shipping. Not only is it good as a marketplace, but it allows us to communicate with who is going to sell what to us, read customer reviews, get special offers, etc... Even their third party companies are good, I recently purchased a laptop from Woot!, this is a company with the amazon guarantee which meant that it was trustworthy. The one thing I have mixed feelings about is both good and bad in its own way. The amazon appstore offers many apps that you would find in other appstores, some that you get for free if they are listed in amazon underground. Another thing that I love about this appstore are the amazon coins, not only do they allow me to get in app purchases for cheaper than usual, when making a purchase, certain apps give credit back. The only problem is that it lacks a lot of the apps that you would easily find in the google playstore or the apple equivalent. Overall, I believe amazon is a great company that finds a way to make sure the customer is satisfied.",5,"“Great Deals, Almost No Downsides” "

3175,"TWO PART REVIEW;
1) Sellers of gently used goods, lend me your ears! 

      NO longer do you have to wait for an auction to end and pray that your item fetched at least the cost to ship it to its new owner. Amazon is just like being able to sell your items among the premium giants of the online retail businesses........! AT A NEARLY RETAIL PRICE!!!   (That's right I s%&t you not my friends. I wouldn't lie to you, I personally swear by Amazon sellers market and have made close to ten thousand dollars selling used items that I referbished from various sources. Items that would have gone for at least 25%-50% less on ebay and even lower on Facebook or Craigslist.)  Did the Facebook reference catch your atention, nearly everyone has Facebook and lover the local buys. But the price is garage sale level and let's face it the market is limited to a few thousand at most.  Amazon is nationwide/global and Amazon allows you you view all other products that are the same as the one you are listing and price your according to your competitors prices.    That means if anyone in the entire country is interested in a product that you happen to be selling you will have play in Amazon.   Quick seller? I am!  And I priced my listings from $1.00-$5.00  below the lowest priced item(which is barely 10%lower than at Walmart or kohl's and even Best Buy) insuring my product would sell to the first frugal consumer interested in the product.    

2)Buyers of o line merchandise! 

         Amazon  has a very strict customer satisfaction percentage requirement for its sellers I think it's like 98.99% positive review rate.  Not like eBay in which u can commit to buy just by wanting to see it in your basket for aditional info and get a negative buyer point.  Untill I buy it I haven't bought it!    Don't tell me because I am looking around I have to buy somthing I don't want anymore or can't really afford.",5,"“DON'T SELL ON EBAY!!!, Amazon is a premium online retailer. Buy and sell with confidence.” "
3176,"Easy to find things, great pricing and delivery, (even from Asia and Europe, although that obviously takes a little longer).",5,“Amazing resource” 
3177,"Never had 1 problem with amazon. Fastest delivery & no hassle returns. Not like EBay, which is the worst. Amazon web site is easy shop on. They have almost anything you want. Prices are good.",5,“Amazon Rocks”

3180,"Always a good experience. Always a lower price, delivered on time, in good condition, and easy to return if necessary, And  they have  almost everything.  And they are always courteous to talk to.......  No wonder Jeff Bezos, the founder, has  become the richest man in the world, ahead of BillGates, unless the stock market favors Gates that day.",5,“Amazon is amazing!!” 
3181,"Excluding clothes, I do almost all of my shopping on Amazon and am always satisfied. I am a Prime member, so delivery takes 2 days.

I also want to watch them take on eBay with no auctions and better pricing for sellers. I would like to see Amazon knock out Walmart.

True product reviews from real customers helps me to decide in purchases and whether to buy it or not. Dislike having to use postal to return items. Don't really ever know who the seller really is and what kind of guarantee they have on their products.

When they make a mistake, I either get a quick refund without having to return merchandise or it's an easy return.  I can't remember having a bad experience with them.  I've been dealing with them for many years & usually when a company treats me poorly, I rarely deal with them again.  I haven't encountered that with Amazon.  They always seem to please.",5,“Why go anywhere else?” 
3305,"My favorite online shop, passed ebay now and such a pleasure to buy quality items and reviews. The only issue is to be able to select what is shippable to your country (E.G Ireland)",5,“My favorite online shop” 
3306,"Most recently, due to the face that I was confused about the arrival time of 2 metal folding chairs, Amazon essentially took my dissatisfaction with a July 4th one day delay and rather than argue with me (I was definitely wrong once I looked at it in retrospect,) They refunded the sizable shipping fee of $13. (it was 2 large metal chairs, I just wanted them fast. The only other 2 times I've had to call customer service, they were perfect and not only fixed my problem, but somehow even increased my trust in them as they made it right,.",5,“It is impossible to dislike a company that has this level of customer service” 
3307,We love amazon. If we need something we look it up and get it. We are never disappointed. Product quality is great.  Items come quickly and if there is an issue it's always taken care of.,5,“I depend heavily on amazon” 
3308,"With the exception that you can accept the following: 
You want free shipping? Meet requirements when you checkout items. Whether it's 25 or 49 dollars. Also check that your items come with the possibility of free shipping, otherwise it will NOT count towards free shipping. (Irritating, I know)
Not all of your products will be delivered when scheduled. I know that may suck, but that is why Amazon allows you to contact sellers to ensure nothing happens to your products along the way.
Some products may never find their way to your home. Which is even more irritating, but the first thing you should do is go on Amazon to contact the seller or file a complaint to Amazon directly. Every time this has happened to me I got promised a full refund within a day or two with no questions asked. (Refunds take time to get to your account. Which implies it will take longer for Amazon to process your refund, it may take up to two weeks to process the full refund)
AND SOME PRODUCTS WILL BE ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE BUT THATS WHY WE MUST READ REVIEWS VERY VERY CAREFULLY AND DEMAND (or ask politely) THAT THE SELLER TAKES THE SAID PRODUCT BACK. 
Some sellers may be very good at making sure you get the product you wanted. Every once in a while I get a card from a seller I buy from, it's handwritten by her, she makes it clear that I can contact her with any questions or concerns about the product. Those types of sellers are the ones that deserve a review, or really any seller that makes sure your product is in ideal condition when it arrives.
Make sure you review! Especially if your experience exceeds or falls below your expectations, honestly a lot of customers look at stars and reviews before they buy a product, be sure to encourage/discourage them accordingly. 

Last note: 
If you decide to purchase a product, make sure it's not overpriced or too cheap.

Overpricing is an obvious issue which I probably don't have to explain
But some products that are underpriced are such terrible quality, and even the sellers might not be all the great either. (That's why you ought to look at reviews!!!!)

I can't recommend this site enough for people who wish to shop online.",5,“It has been an ideal site for me- perhaps for you too”

I always check reviews from private sellers before buying and never go for anyone with a rating below 96% positive. Returns are easy. I've recently subscribed to Amazon prime, thought I would give it a go for a year. I'm loving it.

If Amazon is the seller, returning an item is easy. Their prices can fluctuate quite a bit, so if you see an item that looks like a great deal, it's best to pounce on it pretty darn quick.  I also use the Subscribe and Save program for items I use regularly, again you have to watch the prices, because you can't assume that the price is locked in at the price you got when you first ordered it.  I've done Amazon Pantry, but quit that.  The UPS guy comes to my house a lot and I felt sorry for him having to lug those huge, heavy boxes that Pantry stuff is shipped in.  I did like the program, just not enough to give the guy who likes my big, bouncy dog a hernia.  I also love Kindle books and the Audible program.",5,“I love Amazon.”

Amazon will literally do whatever it takes to make you happy. They do not want customers walking away from a purchase unhappy. There have been times when an item quit working or got broken after the 30 day return period and they still did what they could to make it right.  The amount of convenience coupled with their superior customer service brings me back to them time and time again. 
They have a huge selection of everything and they stand behind it all. Amazon Prime is a very well thought out organization that has determined there is great value in repeat business and to keep that business they make sure you're happy. Need to return something?

The rep responded by apologizing, refunding the payment, and telling me to keep the dumbbell. Outstanding.

Feb 2017--Ordered a nice little bookcase from Amazon fulfillment. It came, I assembled it and  the middle shelf--the screws didn't line up right. It's not a huge problems, still have the others shelves, just 4 instead of 5. When I sent feedback to support, the rep offered a full refund if I sent it back or (as it was still functioning and useful) she would refund me half of my purchase.

As a seller it is very nerve wracking. They are always changing their rules and sometimes without warning.  Just before Christmas they put a hold on any brand name merchandise. Many of us had hihg end sneakers, sport products etc. All of a sudden we could not sell theses items without an approval requiring a $1000 application to sell brand name but it was not a guaranteed approval. If not approved than you lost the whole $1000 dollars. I did not get stuck with inventory but many of my friends then had to sell on Ebay or some other site. Huge disappoint and financial loss just before Christmas. ??? So for a seller it is a great site to purchase from but for a seller your account can be terminated or put on hold for very minor infractions??? It is a great site but a site to be very careful of if you are a seller.",5,“Great for buyers - sellers?”

3813,"Amazon order number : 114-8083188-1541855. 
Macys order number: 1391458161..for those who wish to research the validity of this review.  I was expecting  a shipment from both Macy's and Amazon.com on the same date on about the 15th of March 2017.  I received emails that the items we're delivered but upon getting home from work nothing was on the porch as they usually are and I've been a frequent customer to both companies for years.   I immediately called both and both Macy's and Amazon seemed to understand and show interest in helping however Macy's customer service must be in Vietnam because I could barely understand them.  They both told me I'd be issued a refund so I'm happy at this point.   However at 8pm on this same date the items from Macys showed up on the porch and several days later at about the same time the item from Amazon showed up.  Obviously a delivery error because the UPS info noted left with lady but no lady lives at my address.  Although unsure where it was left they we're honest enough to return it to me.   I called both Macy's and Amazon immediately to correct the credits and here's what I found.  Amazon actually was truthful and issued the refund while Macy's showed no record of any refund and days later sent me a letter saying because of the shipper note (left with lady) they we're unable to issue a refund.   Good thing this mysterious lady that they spoke of at an unknown address and no signature was honest.  My point is it's good to know if there is a problem Amazon is willing to help while Macy's on the other hand will not be getting anymore orders simply because they chose to blame the customer for the shipping error.  I'm sure no one at Macys even thought to check my order history and see the thousands of dollars I've spent there over the years.   Sorry Macys.   Youre done until you care for customer. I'd rather shop Amazon now.",5,“Lost items”

Five minutes chatting with a CSR and I had a free pickup scheduled for the large, bulky item. Then their automatic system deducted shipping from the credit for the item (their error in shipping a canceled order). Another few minutes chatting with a CSR and I had full credit. Their CSRs can bypass their automatic system to give you quick, efficient, and polite assistance. There's no ""I have to send this to a manager to look into."" I appreciate that.

3937,"I buy everything on Amazon! I have a prime subscription too. It's so nice to be able to remember something you need so u jump online to Amazon and order it and it shows up quicker than it would have been to find time to run to the store and get it. They even have these dash buttons for a bunch of stuff like laundry soap for example so when u are running low on laundry soap u just tap the button that u stick on the washer and it automatically connects to Amazon and places the order and then a day or two later it shows up. Too awesome! U pay like $4.95 for each of the buttons but once u place an order for the first time u get that back as a $4.95 discount so the buttons are technically free after your first order. Anyways, Amazon has everything! I love it. I have probably spent over $100,000 buying almost everything for my house, car, and family from the site. The prices are 98% of the time better than anywhere else online and it couldn't be any easier to return a wrong or damaged package (assuming u order it through prime). If anyone doesn't use Amazon as a shopping choice then u are missing out on one of the best shopping options of the new era and it only keeps getting better as the progress. Whether it's a part for your car or a toy for your kid or a product for your lawn, you should always be checking out Amazon.com!!! PS...

4130,"I've been using it for years and it has been a lifesaver. When I need stuff for my dog that I can't find anywhere else or I can leave the house and I need a book for my daughters School. Plus it's half the price of going to Barnes & Noble and you save gas...
One serious note: in the past 6 month I've noticed that probably 50% of the products on the house from China I mean they act like it's an American company they just broker in China so many of these things phone batteries 2 printer ink. So you must be very careful because things are changing on that website and the quality is not top quality like it used to be. Sometimes they let you know it & sometimes they don't. A Sure way to find out is a good part of the stuff with an 8-10 day lead time is probaly/coming off a boat from China. So don't let the extremely low priced items fool you. There's always a catch. AMAZON SHOULD be careful because Trump will start banning them & then ruin it for all the Amazon Great customers, like myself :-( I know I can't live without them so I hope they shape up..on a positive note they offer a chance to return items for free. Customer service is very good I mean you don't get a real person but you do it online and they answer promptly. Rarely, do they deny a return. Even though it's free to do, it's definitely a hassle packing it up and going to UPS or whatever... still I feel they are a 5 star company.",5,“I love Amazon.com Prime”

This is always frustrating (getting got), however the customer service afterwards was outstanding. Minutes beforehand, I had the WORST experience with Walmart.com and cancelled that order even though it would have saved a couple of dollars. It was truly that bad of an experience. Therefore, the customer service I received from Amazon.com was very much appreciated! FIVE STARS FOR AMAZON, EVEN ON CYBER MONDAY!

Of course, Amazon offers items from its own warehouse, but they also offer the same items from third party distributors.  EVEN THEN, if there is a problem,my experience is that Amazon will take care of you. I've had to return items - Amazon paid return shipping.   I've gotten items that were defective and the seller disappeared.  Amazon gave me a refund.  I've had warranty issues with third party seller - Amazon made good on my purchase.  THe bottom line is that I am pretty sure I can rely on Amazon to correct any problems, at their expense, not mine.  That makes them a great online store.",5,“The best part is the customer service”

The reviews give you a very good idea of how the seller responds to problems, the quality of the items and if they stand behind their guarantee.

4455,"I make a list of odd items the family asks for, something I seldom use needed for a recipe, gifts coming up etc. and then set aside a few hours to peruse the site.  Since we live in the country, this kind of list might be a full day of errands pre-Amazon.  We are Prime members so shipping is free, and sometimes I am avoiding sales tax as well.  I compare prices, look for sales or warehouse overstock and read customer feedback, while sipping a cup of coffee or iced tea.  Make my choices, select my delivery options--sometimes 2 days away sometimes a week (for extra credit on future buys), and I know I can return, for free, anything unsuitable.  Got to say, I'm liking this better than big stores, parking hassles, forgetting things yada yada.",5,“Amazon Shopping Is My Vice/My couch potato buddy”

Since we are both handicapped, the husband and I are delighted with the amazingly fast shipping, the excellent customer service, the huge selection of stuff that we often can't find locally in our small town, and the fact that we don't have to struggle to navigate crowds and store aisles that often are clogged up with crap.",5,“Love me some Amazon”

4478,"I just love love love amazon.  One click and I bought something.  It's quick, easy to navigate, can find anything and everything on Amazon!!!",5,“Love Amazon” 
4479,"I buy virtually everything online (from TVs to automobile tires, to door hardware, to food items), and Amazon has been an essential tool for getting what I want easily, quickly, and usually at or near the best possible prices. There's no one out there doing as good a job of supplying almost any product imaginable than Amazon.com. But....you don't always get the best price, and all too often their collection of sales tax makes them uncompetitive. 
So I use Amazon to easily find exactly what I want, and then I make sure there aren't less expensive purchase options available within Amazon. And that's what makes Amazon such a great site and tool--they help you find the cheapest deals if you use them wisely. For example, after searching the most obvious prices available on Amazon, you need to find and click on the Available from These Sellers link to see your options. Those options almost always allow you to place an order with independent 3rd party sellers who don't collect sales tax, and many also provide free shipping, or qualify for Amazon Prime shipping benefits. 
But don't stop there, you also need to click the See All Buying Options button. That's where you may find your item being sold with free 2-day shipping, for example, (which might otherwise never have been available if you hadn't searched a bit further).  
I also have an Amazon Prime membership which saves time and money on shipping while also giving me Amazon Prime movies and TV programs, including some great original series. 
Is everything less expensive using Amazon? No, it's not, but searching that item within Amazon and outside of Amazon provides you almost effortless comparative pricing. So deciding where to get the best overall deal becomes extremely easy. And whenever I'm in doubt and prices are almost identical, I'll usually play it ""safe"" by going with Amazon so that I can easily return an item on a hassle-free basis. That in itself has been one of the best features of Amazon.com.
Remember that Amazon makes buying online extremely easy, but it's real value is as a price comparison tool for finding the best deal possible in the shortest amount of time. Although Amazon.com may not always prove to be the least expensive online seller, the website makes finding the best possible deals incredibly easy. Add to that their hassle-free return policy, and they absolutely deserve the highest ratings possible.",5,“Best overall shopping experience online”

These days I hardly ever shop in brick and mortar stores. And anytime I need something I check Amazon first to see if I can find exactly what I am looking for. I don't look elsewhere once I find it, because I know I am not going to find better prices elsewhere. Even when I have purchased items that did not meet my needs in reality, returns are as easy as going to your account, finding the order, and let Amazon know what you are interested in returning.

They have upped the minimum price for free shipping over the years, but I guess that's to be expected as costs rise.  However, there are still sellers on Amazon that offer free shipping, and depending on where you live, sometimes no tax.  You can pay a variety of ways, get e-books instantly, and make wish lists easily.  You can even order with one click if you choose to set up that option.  Amazon doesn't always have the lowest prices, but often does, so check around online and even in your local stores before you order.  Some businesses in your town may even price match Amazon if you ask and their policy permits it.  One thing I have noticed is that prices can fluctuate wildly, sometimes even the same day, so if you find what you want at a great price you might ought to get it--it might cost more tomorrow (or less)!

You don't have to go thru the hassle of getting dressed, driving to the store, finding a parking place & dealing with sales people (most of whom are on a commission so they worry you to death by being pushy, insistent & aggressive to make a sale & earn $$$). You have to find a dressing room, undress to try on clothing (when the dressing room is usually a mess from prior custormers use), get dressed and go to checkout where the sales person will try to get you to sign up for the store' card (when you already have Visa or Mastercard, etc). Then you have to trek back to your car and deal with traffic going home, Amazon eliminates all the above aggravation (you can sit in your ""PJ's) drink your coffee, eat your snack and browse at any hour day or night, compare all your items of interest, make a decison, pay with your card, then click to complete the purchase.

I am currently an Amazon Prime member and since I buy a lot of items from Amazon, the two day free shipping is something that keeps me coming back. I must admit however that I also bounce each purchase off of Ebay because you can often find cheaper items there and you do not have to usually pay the tax there. Also Ebay offers Ebay Bucks for most purchases that accumulate quarterly and you can use those bucks towards any purchase sometimes getting things for free. The shipping usually takes a few days longer to get to you but if it is something I don't need right away, I will go to Ebay instead of Amazon. It's also usually a little tougher if you have a problem with a purchase because the hoops you have to jump through at Ebay, make it more of a pain that Amazon which is very liberal in it's return policy. With Amazon now trying to get into groceries, I cannot wait to see how this shakes out.",5,“Can't Go Wrong with Amazon”

It is not unusual for me to order an item that shows up the next day. Returns are just as easy, however, if you return something that 'you did not like' as apposed to does not work or was not what the description stated, they take the return cost out of your refund. When you request a return, they send you an email with a shipping form to print. I use Amazon a lot, but I also do a 'google' search for the product to be sure it is the best price. I find in most cases when you add the shipping from the other vendor Amazon comes out lower. And I keep in mind the easy return process.",5,“Fast and easy purchasing/ordering”

4995,"I love Amazon. Since I despise shopping, this is a great option. Jeff Besos is a genius, of course. His idea for customer service relations is a business model every on-line seller should use: generally, no questions asked return. And the response time is within seconds of asking for a return phone call or email. The only thing I do not like is a part of the Amazon Prime program. I've found that when I use Prime to shop, the item is generally higher than if I bought it through another vendor. The trick may be their free 2-day shipping promise. Other vendors may take longer to ship, but the cost is often much less. For example, if you look for a book and it's $18 on Amazon with free shipping, you may be able to find the same one for $5 plus shipping of about $3.. That could be a lot less expense for you. But the ""free shipping"" idea makes the buyer more likely to purchase it through Amazon. Plus the fact that you've paid your $$ up front for Prime services, would probably make a buyer use Amazon Prime services.  It's a rather tricky marketing tool, but it works for them. It's sort of the ""you pay me now or you pay me later"" mentality.",5,“Love Amazon - but they're practically taking over all shopping”

5079,"I order from Amazon weekly, if not more often, and am amazed at the swift delivery, the ease of returns, and the amazing breadth of products offered.  My only concern has been with the packaging a few times--I ordered some liquid garden products that included organic pest control.  That came in a large box that also included a WaterPik & accessories.  The bottles of garden products leaked all over the box and other contents, and it leaked all over the postal carrier's vehicle.  Amazon replace the items, which was nice, but the stink and aggravation was unwelcome...  No edible or health care products ever should be packed with pest control products--no commonsense there!  On another occasion, I ordered a three-jar pack of Lingonberries.  These were bound together in a manner that would suggest safety, but the middle jar was smashed and leaked sticky goo all over everything else in the box--insufficient packing material had been used--those air pillows had shifted all over, the box was too large, and it seemed, again, that commonsense was absent in the packing process.  Amazon always replaces items such as this, but they could save money and time and customer anger if a little more ""thought"" went into the  packing process.  If robots pack, however, they need to be programmed accordingly ;)",5,"“Frequent 'Flyer""” "

5151,"I am very seasoned consumer on Amazon and have just experienced a few watch outs.
Pay very close attention to small details especially when you need a product in a short time frame. Primarily, when the product is not coming from an Amazon fulfillment center.

In the last 2 weeks I had 2 orders bite me. One was coming direct from China and the other from India.

The China order was simply a pair of mini USB power cords, great price, 2 for $5.49. The deal was so great I missed the details, ordered at 8:00 PM, by 11:00 PM I was notified that the product was already shipped. Blown away, however, it was really shipped the next business day as it was coming from China. And it was sent regular mail. Goty the product 3 weeks later. So my haste cost me as I had ordered for a friend who required the product right away.

The order from India, also took 3 weeks, but this was goofy, maybe culture or whatever, they shipped the product registered mail. What a royal pain. I have product shipped to my condo in Florida and my neighbour puts the product away for me awaiting our return. UPS and FedEx are great, they know our place  always leave it where required. But registered mail, it became a nightmare.

They hold the sellerz to high standards & it works out well. I've never had a problem with any orders. The prices are decent & the quality has always been as I expected. I buy often, especially at Christmas so it was worth it for me to buy the Prime membership. The bonus is that you get a LOT of free movies you can watch on TV (like Netflix), plus movies you can buy right from the TV. I've gotten several popular ones for $10-15.

As a seller: You have to keep in mind that they do take a commission & price accordingly. A little tip- don't price anything below $8. As long as you're honest in your description, taking pictures if needed, you'll be fine. They make it easy to have your item listed in 5 minutes. They even suggest a price range based on others that are listed. When we decided to down scale & got rid of a lot of stuff I was making $90 a day. A lot more than I would have gotten at a yard sale. I'm helping my brother in law get rid of his books. He has over 200, way more than I can store. With Amazon all I do is list them, & with one little checkmark I notify Amazon that I want them to take over. They have me print out a label & I box & ship them for them to handle. They store them, ship them, collect the money, handle any customer questions & notify me of what I've sold & my profit. The money is deposited right to my bank account. You can do this with anything you sell.",5,“Great site to shop & sell!”

5270,"Amazon.com is most likely the best online marketplace you'll ever encounter!

Jeff Bezos, the creator of Amazon.com had many complaints on where to find specific items, especially the rare ones, but didn't have time to look at all the stores and online shopping sites for them. He spent many years trying to figure out why, and then it suddenly hit him. He realized there was no such place to buy everything the world has to offer.

He then spent many years in website development until he came across a rather unusual phenomenon. The place he was dreaming of was right before his eyes, and with that in mind, he decided to become the founder of such a project. He spent many days trying to come up with a good international name for the company, and then finally decided to name it after one of the most restricted places in all of South America - Amazon (based off the Amazon River).

The website's focus has, and always has been the practice and motto of the customer always being right, making it the best place to find exactly what you need, even if they don't necessarily sell what you're looking for 100% in the United States. In fact, many useful products that are imports are being sold to authorized United States retailers today, some of which the seller has opted to allow Amazon to fulfill the delivery of the products.

Although the site has a good reputation, there are sometimes criminals that create fake merchant IDs to either steal your money, or otherwise provide you with counterfeit products in your order. For this kind of case, Amazon.com had created the A-to-Z Safe Buying Guarantee, to help protect buyers from potential fraudulent sellers. Even criminals who close their Amazon.com accounts before the order is complete can still be subject to the system, as the seller ID remains on Amazon.com servers until the 60-day A-to-Z claim filing period has passed, making this the safest place to buy with confidence.

5354,"When it comes to finding a slimming belt that gives you that highly-coveted flat tummy, while providing the conditions your body needs to burn off excess fat, most waist trimmers fall short of the mark. 
Personally, I've tried a number of slimming belts in the past, and found that the majority are either too tight and uncomfortable to allow for a proper workout, or so absorbent that it felt as though I was carrying around a week's worth of sweat!

This waist trimmer is an incredibly well-made neoprene belt (with rubber lining), that's been backed by a lifetime warranty for even greater piece of mind. Both the 9"" width and 42"" length are suited for a wide range of sizes. In fact, both myself and my wife can use the same slimming belt! What's more, the placement and strength of the Velcro fastenings are ideal for great support and no unwanted chafing. 

The first time I wore this waist trimmer, it wicked away moisture so quickly that I didn't even take it off for SIX hours. At first, I thought it was another failure that didn't work because I didn't feel wet in the slightest - even after jumping rope. However, when I removed the belt I was actually dripping with sweat underneath, even though the slimming belt itself dried out almost immediately when laid aside. 
One of the best things about this waist trimmer is that the design helps to keep me mindful of my posture, and keeps me tightening my abs throughout a workout. What's more, as a slimming belt, it provides a surprising amount of back support, while appearing to give me a flatter (more attractive) stomach. 

Unfortunately, if you're thinking that this slimming belt will raise your metabolism and shed pounds for you without diet and exercise then you're going to be disappointed. The truth is that no waist trimmer works like that. Instead, you use your slimming belt while exercising to improve your core temperature, which enriches circulation and leads to great metabolic changes. Rather than losing belly fat instantly, you might lose temporary water weight which you'll then regain. However, your workouts will be more effective, and you might be able to achieve the ideal body faster. I know it's working for me!",5,“Best Waist Trimmer for the money by a long shot.”

This rainbow bridge bird toy is very nice for birds the size of a cockatiel or larger. It would be great for any parrots or macaws or cockatoos or something like that as well.
All of the pieces are made of natural wood that are on the bridge their flat pieces and then there are round balls in between them. They are strong with a stick a leather. The only pieces I really do not care for on this toy are the chain links. They are just a hollow plastic material. I do not think those will hold up very well. The rest of the toys made very well.
It is 18 inches into end. From into it and I mean from the end of one clip to the end of the other clip. These quick clips are very nice you can hang this horizontally or vertically in your cage you can either it is 18 inches into end. From into and I mean from the end of one clip to the end of the other clip. These quick clips are very nice you can hang this horizontally or vertically in your cage. You can hang it from the top of your cage by either and since there is a hook on each end. It is a pretty sturdy clip so will hold up. Also, since there is a hook on each and you can turn it over to have either end of the top.
This would not be long enough to go side to side across a birdcage that would hold a larger bird. However, this would work diagonally in a cage going from the side to the back or from the front to the side.
Most birdcages have a perch across the cage. If this is the case with your bird it is probably best just to hang it vertically from the top of the cage towards the bottom of the cage. This way it would move more when they played with it.

Pros: bright colors, natural wood to chew, sturdy clips on each end.

Cons: Plastic chain pieces will break easily with a large bird.",5,“cool bird toys”

It's wise to look into the company you're ordering from if it's not directly through Amazon, because the products may not be good quality. However, I've ordered indirectly through Amazon many times and I've been perfectly happy with what I've gotten.

I didn't want synthetic and made that a criteria in my search.  The description stated they were leather, but when they arrived, they were synthetic leather.  I called the vendor that night, very upset and demanded they take them back.  They sent me a return authorization, but when I saw the credit issued, I went through the roof.  Not only did they charge me the shipping (they said they wouldn't), but they only refunded me the lower price of the synthetic, not the more expensive leather.  Meanwhile, the vendor got busy and went to their Amazon listing and changed the description of the shoes.  After several phone calls and going in circles with the vendor, I contacted Amazon.  They pulled up the order, verified the description at the time of purchase and the amount charged and refunded, and when I hung up the phone I had my full purchase price refunded to me including the shipping!

If I buy Amazon and have any issue at all, I just send an Amazon chat, and they handle it right there.    I buy so much and have to return occasionally.  Never had a problem.

5815,"A resolution regarding my original review. I was contacted the following day via email by one of the customer service rep's I had encountered regarding my return and reorder of my boots. I replied with the same information that was in my original review. I received a response email from an Amazon supervisor regarding my horrible experience. She was sympathetic and assured my experience with the two rude and unsatisfactory customer service reps would be forwarded to their appropriate supervisors. The supervisor that contacted me regarding my purchase and return issue went above and beyond to rectify the issue. She adjusted my price to the original sale price I paid, plus an additional discount, and upgraded the shipping for my return purchase. I have to say that Amazon step up and handle the entire situation to my satisfaction. I only hope that the original two customer service rep's that rudely spoke to me, and had no desire to rectify the issue had hand was reprimanded and had some additional customer service training.

This was my original ordeal and complaint regarding a recent customer service issue with Amazon.  I ordered a pair of boots on Cyber Monday and got 20% off and free shipping. I ordered the size I wear and when I received them they were to long. I wanted a even exchange for a small size. The website doesn't have the option for you to do an exchange online. So, I called Amazon customer service regarding an exchange. The customer service representative emailed me a return label, I was told they would refund me & I could replace the order. Then call customer service and they would adjust the price for the amount that I originally paid for it. I placed my order tonight, call customer service to do the price adjustment. First the girl was not listening or could not understand what I was calling about. After great frustration I asked for a supervisor, and I explain what the rep I spoke to regarding the return/exchange told me about calling and asking for the price adjustment. I was treated like I was telling a lie and making up the fact that their representative advised me of ask for the price adjustment. I was kept on hold for 58 minutes, still without resolution to the issue I called about. I was spoken down too, spoken over top of, rude, arrogant, and short of being called a liar, in the most condescending and nasty way. I was screamed at ""we don't offer or do exchanges, and we do not do price adjustments, that they would do a ""One Time"" exception."" I explained it was their representative that specifically told me how to make my exchange and get them price adjusted so it was the same cost to me. It was the WORST customer service I had ever encountered. And I told her so, when I asked her name she screamed it at me. When I asked for a supervisor she said she didn't have one. I told her I was not born yesterday, nor was I stupid. She definitely a boss of some level, and I was certain of this because I know she was not the owner of Amazon. I have been in customer service most of my life, and I know what good customer service is, and take pride in my job. Something tell me this Amazon customer service rep did not have any respect or pride, and certainly does not need to be working with the public. She told me they ""do not do exchanges"" and I could take her offer or forget it that was ALL they were going to do for me. No where on the website does it say they don't do exchanges. The actual web page that you go to for returns, it actually states for ""Returns, Refunds, or Exchange"". Needless to say I will not be purchasing anything else from Amazon. Very disappointed in being treated like I was a liar and beneath her (Kristy the supposed Supervisor). I have been in customer service for almost 40 years and I have NEVER treated or spoken to anyone in that manner or tone. It is disrespectful, and unprofessional.",5,“Customer Service Worst Ever But Amazon stepped up and Resolved the Problem”

The downside is I really need to get outside more. Also I find shopping inside a brick and mortar store more culturally satisfying.

My purchases so far which are significant have almost always met my satisfaction.  I have only had to return one item out of hundreds.  Price guarantee is an Amazon policy but collecting a refund after the fact requires a lot of obscure website navigation.

5941,"Amazon.com is an online shopping website. They sell everything from new to used at a cheap price. Rather if you're looking for a guitar to rock out on, an outfit to dress like a diva, get the latest gaming accessories or whatever you're looking for you'll certainly be a satisfied customer. It normally takes up to a week (Including business days) to get your order, or if you have amazon prime you get it in a little as two days. To get amazon prime you must pay $99 a year after a one month free trail or pay $49 a year (if you're a student) after a 6 month free trail. Amazon prime not only gives shipping in two days, but it's free as well. That's right, FREE shipping and handling. You also get early access to the newest stuff, you get to stream thousands of movies and TV and get unlimited access to your favorite songs. They even allow you to sell your own stuff on the website or trade it in for cash. If you're not satisfied with your purchase just get in contact with the seller and ship it back to them and you'll get your refund. But however there is one con. Some of the sellers are rip-off artist, procrastinate and sometimes lie saying the package is on the way. They'll sometimes lie and say your order is in perfect condition when it's not, and not take care of it after you paid for S&H. So should you should probably check the ratings and comments on the item the sellers selling, before you buy anything. But cut off those rotten apples and you got a perfect tree. The scam buyers really doesn't do anything to my 5 star review for Amazon, due to it's great customer service and refund policy. Are you still reading this?

I ordered an item and twice it never showed up despite the tracking saying it had been delivered. It was being sent from Dell and not Amazon. I called Customer Service and without any headache at all, they shipped FREE OF CHARGE overnight the item. I was speechless. I say, ""rare"" because I just don't have problems with their site.

When I ordered disposable bakeware, they shipped a package of 2 instead of 4 packages of 2.  When I asked for the rest, they sent me a full refund.  When I ordered 20 pounds of Basmati rice at an exceptional price, and got 10 pounds, they gave me a choice of getting a second 10-pound bag, or a 50% refund.

5989,"Alright, what can I say that most folks don't already know.  Amazon.com is an amazing website backed by awesome customer service.  The best way to appreciate the full benefits of Amazon is to become a ""Prime"" member for $99 a year.  Trust me, the money that you save from the free 2-day shipping benefit alone will add up to over the cost of the membership if you are a frequent online shopper.

There are also other benefits of ""Prime"" such as starting a music library from their online music collection, getting a choice of a free e-book every month, getting a preview of deals before they start, unlimited video streaming of ""Prime"" movies and TV series.  There is something for everyone and it can be shared with members in the same household (at least the free shipping part can). UPDATE:  You can share your entire Kindle library to an adult member in your house that owns a Kindle.

If you ever need to return something, you can print the return label from your computer and just drop your package off at a UPS store.  The credit back to your account is usually very quick.  Like I said, great customer service!",5,“The Best Ever!”

Amazon's technology prowess is also amazing: the Kindle, for example, allows you to carry your library with you and provides inestimable services in retrieving and using the info highlighted.

I also joined Amazon prime, for $99/year I get free two day shipping for anything marked Prime. Also I watch Prime movies for free anytime. And one of the best features of Amazon is, any time I have to return something I bought from Amazon, no problem. I get my refund fast too. 
There are two cons to Amazon: 1. They don't include a return label with the item, I have to print it out which is a hassle for me, or they will mail me a label for $1 on request. 2. If you buy from another seller, other than Amazon, it can end up being a battle, and there might be a restocking fee, so read each sellers return policy.

6267,"Hi,
I am a member of Amazon prime and I have had the privilege of purchasing items from them all the time. I have bought numerous things and they always get delivered to me. One time I had something delivered but was gone when it came so the postal carrier stuck it in my door and somebody came along and stole it. (I later was able to recover some of the items) as somebody decided to return my package opened and some of the contents missing.  Amazon when they got wind of my missing package sent me something in replacement. That has been my experience with them and I am sure glad that they were willing to help me like that. I will buy more stuff from them as a matter of fact. That's how much I appreciate their thoughtfulness and help under the circumstances and it was through no fault of their own doing. Thanks Amazon for taking care of me!

I usually find something I like, and then go to Amazon to see if they have it and they usually do, cheaper, and with Prime, free shipping to boot.

I always check Amazon reviews before making a purchase also. To be honest, the negative reviews tell me a lot more about the product than positive ones do.

Short and to the point: If it's not on Amazon and cheaper? It's not for sale!",5,"“Amazon.com, my second home” "
6317,"I have made about 10 purchases on Amazon.com and no problems encountered. All items were as described and arrived to my home on time. Best prices I could find on the internet. Really fast shipping. Very friendly user interface and easy to navigate website, so I'm happy to recommend.",5,“Best prices on the internet and everywhere” 
6318,ORDERED AT LEAST 10 TIMES NEVER HAD A PROBLEM,5,“GREAT WEB SITE” 
6319,"As both a seller and a buyer on Amazon, it is not without its problems, but is overall, a good place to shop for just about anything you want for lower costs than what you would normally pay at big box retail stores, plus you generally do not have to pay any tax which is a huge savings as well, but if you order anything under $35 or have a total order of $50 from two different sellers, then you still have to pay shipping unless you have Prime and the shipping is usually much higher than what it actually costs to ship the item.
You may also discover that the seller does not take returns or that you have to pay to ship it back. You may also get damaged items that arrive from China and would cost more to ship back for a return, so there are some disadvantages, especially when shopping for clothes which look great on-line, but fit poorly or are made cheaply.

In short, it is best to use Amazon for things you find locally and like, but are too expensive to purchase. Then go to Amazon and find the same thing for cheaper so you know exactly what you are getting.

Be sure to take advantage of the reviews for items as well which will help you know if something runs small or large or holds up well over time. Don't write a review on an item you have purchased until you have used it for at least a month as you may discover that the deal that you got was really not a deal in the long haul.

The three things I like most about Amazon: they have hard to find items you may not be able to purchase locally, especially if you live in a small town; they allow you to read reviews of the items and store things in a wish-list that you can give to others who might want to buy you something but don't know what to get; they often have better bargains and indepth descriptions so you can take your time and really read about the good and bad before making a purchasing decision without being pressured by a salesperson. I also like that you can order downloadable books and music and rent textbooks.

The three things I dislike most: You cannot combine shipping on similar items and don't really know who is selling what until you go to check out; many of the items they offer can be found cheaper on eBay, sometimes as much as $30 cheaper for an item under $100 and sellers list things between $43 and $98 and it usually turns out that the $43 item is some terrible color or a size only 2% of the population can wear, so it can be misleading and causes you to hunt and search rather than go directly to what you want at the price you are willing to pay. Lastly, shipping can be really slow without Prime and costly as well and free returns are not a guarantee, so there is always a risk factor involved that makes buying new items a bit nerve wracking.

Amazon could improve by having an Amazon Central store where all items came from one location, so you could order your nutritional needs, buy a pair of shoes and order a new part for your washer and dryer and have them all ship free in one box with a guarantee that you could return them for free if they were not what they were advertised to be.

Shop around before purchasing on Amazon because you could lose money on that ""deal"". They may also not have the latest items in stock. Selling on Amazon is another matter and sellers are not really protected from unscrupulous buyers the way they are on eBay.

Still, overall, Amazon offers a valuable service with fair prices and ships to your door, so is great for those who really do not want to hassle with fighting crowds or deal with pushy salespeople who won't let you browse on your own.",5,"“Prices can be high and shipping on small orders adds up without Prime, but a great place to shop” "

6353,"Nothing will take the place of print books!  There is a feeling, a panache if you will, in holding a book in your hands, in flipping pages back and forth and yes, in savoring the aroma of the pages, be they newly printed or reeking with the mustines that comes of great age in a quiet library.  Kindle cannot match the timelessness of a print book.  But they don't have to!  What Amazon Kindle does is to enable new writers to essentially ""self-publish"" and to allow the market-place to decide the worth of the book on its own.  It stands by itself, or it fails based on how it is received by the on-line community.  And while Amazon has not yet figured out how to waft the aroma of books electronically, or to fold back the corner of a page for future reference, it succeeds in providing a convenient way to read a book -- nay, MANY books -- in a compact format.  You can read on your computer screen, on a tablet or on a smart phone, limited only by the amount of charge in your battery.  Kindle books are sometimes offered free for various periods of time.  This is often a marketing tactic to stimulate demand for an author's work.  Otherwise, Kindle books typically range from 99 cents to perhaps $9.99.  They are delivered instantly to your reader and they are yours forever.  Also, when you read a book on Kindle, you might love it enough to go out and buy a hard copy to grow old with . . . or to have the author sign.  I just bought a hard copy of Caroline Glick's excellent analysis, ""The Israeli Solution,"" after reading it on Kindle, and she signed it.  Reader, go, search Kindle.

Amazon has that, and more.

6579,"I have been completely satisfied with all my Amazon purchase experiences. When I have been unhappy with a specific purchase, Amazon has been wonderful about authorizing a refund and paying the return shipping charges. My only complaint is with the book ordering. They have stopped offering a discount for pre-orders of some books. That just means I go elsewhere for those books. Otherwise, I love Amazon's promptness, service, and reliability.",5,“I rely on Amazon”

Changing my mind a little about shopping online!!!!!,5,“Awesome Online” 
6591,Super service and fast shipping!!,5,“GREAT” 
6592,My family teases me about always getting boxes/packages from Amazon.  I find I can't beat their prices 9 times out of 10 at our local WalMart plus I get whatever I ordered within 2 days.  Love being able to read other customer's reviews to convince me whether or not a product is worth the money.  Also the questions that customers ask are very helpful.  Can't get that while shopping in a store when you are wondering whether or not to buy something.  Also if something is wrong with the product Amazon makes it so easy to be able to return it.  No issues ever from this loyal customer!,5,“FANTASTIC!”

6598,"Amazon, especially with Prime Membership, is far and away the best overall online store. The selection is unmatched, and the prices are almost always the best you can find, or very close to it. Prime is worth it for the free 2nd-busines-day shipping. I do not use other Prime services like music or Amazon Video or anything else. If Amazon raises the price of Prime Membership significantly, then I would have to decline, particularly if their justification is all the added Prime features that I do not use. Otherwise, I cannot rate this store lower than any other I've come across, ever.",5,“Gold standard” 
6599,They always try to resolve your problem. I have had prime for years. It is the best! So far only one error since they opened. I buy at least 100 things per year. GO AMAZON!,5,“I love Amazon”

6604,"I am an Amazon Prime member. I place several orders each month and the order process is clean and simple I like the 2 day free shipping and there is never a problem with returns. I would prefer that all orders would be fulfilled directly by Amazon rather than by other suppliers, and they should never use USPS for the last mile of shipping, prefer UPS.  But overall I am a very happy Amazon customer.",5,“I just keep coming back” 
6605,"This purse offers bright and vibrant colors which are sure to get noticed and have you getting compliments. On the back is has the same colors but strips instead of block/diamonds on the front.The metal accents really make this bag pop and offer a step up to the design. I was offered this purse to sample for evaluation. I did not promise to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest, unbiased review.
The straps on this purse offer as suitable thickness which is perfect to carry comfortably. The zipper on this purse is a metal one with a metal pull, so it is sure to last. The inside is lined with a durable material and inside of this purse offers a great depth. There are pockets as well as a zippered compartment with this purse on the inside. There is also an adjustable strap you can add to this purse to carry it on your shoulder if you don't wish to carry it. I have been using this purse for a little over 3 weeks and overall I am impressed with it. I highly recommend this purse to anybody who likes a fun, bright well made purse- And SUPER price.

6606,"It has the scent of new leather, subtle yet unmistakable. It's a patchwork of colors, to some gaudy or over the top. Rows of studs decorate the sides while in front is a can't miss glimmering skull with rays of alternating studs and rhinestones radiating outward. Soft, padded lambskin handles cushion the weight of a heavy bag. An shoulder strap, attachable to two large metal rings, is included as an option for those who prefer to carry a bag on the shoulder.

On the outside of the bag is a zippered compartment large enough for some cell phones or a set of keys. In the bag's interior is another zippered compartment larger and deeper than the one on the exterior. Also in the interior are two slip in compartments with soft lining. Speaking of lining, it is not fastened to the bottom of the bag so can be pulled out enough for easy cleaning or shaking.
The main compartment of the flat bottomed bag is secured via zipper with a large, easy to grasp leather fob.

Now for the obvious. This can't-help- but-notice bag is not for everyone. Some will be put off by the kaleidoscope of bright colors. Others won't care for the grinning, metal skull or the excess of glam. Some women have told me they would like this bag were it made with more muted colors or less glam. Some, however, will find the bag perfect for their tastes, like a former coworker of mine who loved anything with skulls.

Note - The colors in the listing photos of this bag don't match the colors on the bag next to me as I type this. So perhaps colors will vary on these bags.

In 4 years I haven't had to call until last week when. I continued with an order not remembering I didn't have enough on my card I called quickly to see if I could cancel it before having it go through and getting an overdraft (wasn't expecting much or had much hope since I had already made the order) but.. they responded quick and canceled it quick and smoothly.

6623,"The only reason I would not continue to shop with Amazon is because I feel guilty that I have abandoned my local brick and mortal shops.  That was until I spoke with an employee of Amazon.  She was very kind and it made me feel good that I was helping a fellow American with my purchase. What can I say?  I have been shopping on Amazon for more than two years.  I think there were only three times that I did not like the product I received.  However, because these sellers earn stars for customer service, whatever problems I encountered were handled fast and to my satisfaction.  If I needed money returned that happened.  If I needed to exchange a product that happened.  Once even, I was told to keep the erroneous product and still I received the replacement at no extra charge.  They didn't send me some funky email asking if they could send me back half the price I spent like that Zulliy did.  I have become a fan of Amazon because of my shopping experience.  I have purchased lots of books, a few camera batteries, an adapter that converts my Blue Ray Disc player into RCA components.  I really like the Streaming Movies on Amazon, too.  I tried Amazon Prime by accident one time and they quickly stopped the subscription and refunded my account.  I really love the streaming movies.  If I can't find a streaming movie on Netflix (which was often), I was usually always able to find it streaming on Amazon.  Sometimes I would rent the movie, which was great because they gave me weeks to watch it. I could watch my Amazon movie on my laptop, my smartphone, my tablet, Roku box and my Blue Ray Disc (when I connected it to wi-fi).  Amazon is my new shopping buddy.  I still however, enjoy going to my local merchants and making purchases, but if the price is too high, I do and have gone back to Amazon and have been pleasantly surprised.",5,“I Love Shopping on Amazon”

Because of this, they stand behind the products being sold on their site. Most sellers are great about receiving returns, but they may not accept returns for free and sometimes they add an additional re-stocking fee, so always be aware to check their return policy and re-stocking fees.  Amazon promises that if you buy something from a seller and you don't get treated right, they will stand behind your purchase.  I love Amazon's fast shipping service and their customer service. They have always been happy to assist me on the few times I have contacted them for help. I can count on Amazon to supply me with what I need and the service is the fastest of any other online store that I am aware of. You can find virtually everything. Additionally, Amazon Prime costs $99 per year which gives you 2 day free shipping and you also get Amazon Prime Instant Video. This is somewhat like Netflix, in addition to their many free prime movies and TV shows,  you have the option to make video purchases similar to Vudu or CinemaNow. Amazon Prime member benefits allow you to share this service with up to 5 members of your household. So, if $99 seems a little steep, find a family member or 5 to share the expense. All you have to do add their email and dob to get them signed onto your prime account. No need to worry, they don't use your account. They can use their current account or create a new one and use their own payment method, but they can share in your benefits. I share my Prime membership with my son, we each pay $50 per year.",5,“Amazing Amazon”

6648,"One thing I like are fun , bright, different style handbags and purses. Most would say I collect them. When I came across this Avber Floral bag there was no way I could pass it by not only because it is so different ( have never seen another like it) but they 3 colors it comes in Mint green, pink or white. I went with the mint green as I have non other in that shade.The handbag was provided to me as a sample for evaluation. I did not promise to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest, unbiased review
When it came in the mail it came in a pink storage bag which was awesome so while storing it when not using I wont have to worry about it getting messed up or dirty.
I took it out of the pink storage back and Oh my the color is so true to the pink a very nice mint green. The feel of the faux leather is so soft. Every thing from the handbag to the flowers on the front are made from it.The handbag is 12.6 x 5.9 x 10.6 inches and perfect for everything you need to carry from your wallet, phone, even an ipad or tablet will fit nicely in it.The handbag comes with a strap that is the same color and material as the bag & that you can attach very easily to the gold hardware on the bag.
The handbag/purse has heavy gold hardware for a handle that is engraved and also has 5 crystal like gems on each side, loop to attach the strap, also on the strap to attach and the oval snap to open and close. Once you open the purse it is lined with a chocolate brown fabric.You have a small zipper pocket, a smaller compartment , another larger zipper pocket, and a VERY large compartment along with 2 pockets that are lined with the mint green leather which is the perfect size for your glasses & phone.
This case ls absolutely beautiful. Much better than I expected. If you have doubts, don't have them anymore. It is everything you could want in a case, and it is very stylish.

6664,"I got the Motorola Moto E LTE(2nd gen) 2015 model to replace my aging Samsung Galaxy S2.
I had the S2 for quite a while now and never really thought about upgrading until files would sometimes become corrupted and undeleteable, wifi connection would be finicky half the time, sometimes my carrier wouldn't be detected or connectable to, call quality with the onboard mic/speaker was poor(Bluetooth headsets do not have this problem) but most irritating of all most apps would take 4-8 seconds to start up no matter what I did to optimize the android system. After seeing all the fancy models coming out I decided I needed an upgrade.

I mainly chose the new 2015 Moto E due to press provided by reviews on YouTube and online. I was made aware of its pros and cons from the very start. I new it wasn't gonna be like these new flagships raging all over the news, but I didn't need it to be. I wanted a simple yet stable platform for simple tasks like youtube, we surfing, calls/texts and email. Something that started applications quickly, was stable and affordable.
I just got the phone today and it came in a tiny box, much smaller than what I saw some of the reviewers received. It contained the phone, a QuickStart guide, a Motorola specs and warranty booklet and a micro usb charger. Start up was very easy. I just plugged in my sim and SD card, connected to my wifi network and then logged into my Google account. Everything just synced right up. (IMPORTANT NOTE: it is not necessary to have a google account or use a wifi network. The phone will work just fine for calls with just the SIM card.)
The interface and experience of the phone is WAAAAY better than my previous phone. Apps start up right away, navigating between app drawer and home screen is a lot faster, no more lag! I'm so happy.

The feel of the phone is very solid, no rattles or creaks noted. The back has a nice matte finish. It weighs just as much as my Galaxy S2, which isn't a lot. I'll take some photos and post them here. The phones are equal length and width, but the Moto E is definitely thicker overall. The E despite its thicker body, feel better in the hand due to the gentle curvature of the edges. Thus allowing your fingers to better ""wrap around"" when reaching or swiping on the screen. Screen sizes are about the same with the Android buttons being onscreen on the Moto E vs on the bezel with the Galaxy. Looking closely, the screen of the MOTO E is a bit sharper, while the S2 has a slight blue tinge to it. This review feels a bit long winded and I hope it helps someone.",5,“Amazon good”

I can wear a tank top or a big jacket and I can still have this over my shoulder. The bag itself is not very structured, so it all depends on your personal preference and style, but I really like it. It even comes with a duster bag like my higher end purses. I would say that, for the money, this is a great choice. Better than a lot of the bags I see at TJ Maxx!

Their pricing is often excellent, usually only being undercut by promo discounts from sites such as Newegg, MicroCenter, etc, but with free 2-day  Prime shipping, it's almost always the clear winner.

Their customer service is extremely helpful, and available by phone, email, or my personal favorite, by online chat. The chat option has saved me on multiple occasions where I am at a location where I cannot answer the phone, but need help immediately.

Finally, with the abundance of extra features on the site such as immediate links to SquareTrade and other warranty and protection services, order price updates and price changes based on their own advertised prices, there's nowhere I'd rather shop.

6740,"I admit I have strayed from the herd and tried to get deals from some Chinese companies, Aliexpress and DHGate. Lured by very low prices, well it is all a mirage, I am back shopping with Amazon.com, where you may experience some small problems that are legitimate and annoying but you really appreciate how small they are after you have been robbed by the Chinese versions of Amazon who advertize such low prices. How do they do it? well they either never have any intention of shipping anything to you in the first place, that cuts down on over head and significantly improves their profit margin. or if they do ship something it is absolute garbage, this cost them nothing but postage and helps take some stress off China's already overburdened garbage facilities also referred to as factories Then their already a joke of customer service completely disappears.
Unlike over 99 percent of Aliexpresses and DHGates client base who have never been to China I have , A couple of years ago I spent two months there in the cesspool they like to call China, where the quality of the air is slightly better than the quality of what they produce and the air today in Beijing was Chunky style! What was I thinking ? That in two years a country in the world with the worst quality control has all of a sudden in 2 years straightened all their problems out?
So I appreciate Amazon.com again this is partly review of the service excellence we have gotten spoiled by and come to expect over the years but the majority of it is just trashing the Chinese upstarts that have tried but failed to mimic what Amazon does. 
BTW I am a Canadian shopper but we tend to use Amazon.com for the better selection and much better prices and shipping so quick! How do they do it? sometimes if I purchase something on Amazon.ca and I know that the Canadian Postal System is going to get it's grubby little paws on it I just go ahead and put it in my will, I know although i am still young I will never see it so I hope a niece or a nephew might enjoy it someday it would be nice if Amazon.com sent a team to Amazon.ca and showed them just a little, not everything, but just a little of how online shopping and shipping works...please.",5,"“This is how online shopping should be,” "

6879,"The Prime membership gives two day no charge shipping on only items direct from Amazon.com or cooperating vendors as best as I can tell and those items tend to be a little higher priced than the same item from other vendors on Amazon.com which is a consideration only if they do not offer free shipping or you would order too little to qualify for the other vendor's free shipping. to at least make up part of the difference, but if you need things that are hard to find this seems to be the best place to order them because of the huge selection of vendors and merchandise.  

The only caution is that if you are buying something with a promised delivery date weeks away it is probably being shipped directly from China or elsewhere in Asia and you might want to consider both whether you want to wait that long or cancel it and pay a little more to get a likely higher quality sold in the USA item.  You basically gamble on quality in that situation because most orders will not be cost effective for you to pay return shipping for a refund.  We came out way ahead on barbers capes but behind on some other times, so just be careful you order the right thing from the beginning.

Realize too that on some items, like used books, that don't qualify for free shipping that they may be not price competitive with even local purchase once shipping is added.  A lot of 1 cent paperback books for example come with $3.99 for shipping.

Never stake your job or your life on Amazon's Prime 2 day shipping to arrive on time because it often does but doesn't always do so and the shipper has until 8 p.m. to make delivery on the promised day, well after work hours if a business with no set arrangements with the carrier for delivery only during business hours.  Also if you send the shipment to an extended services U. S. Postal Service location be aware that they may not have the item available for you until the day after delivery, especially with later in the day deliveries and Amazon locket locations may not keep your delivery as long as your would like to get when convenient.",5,“No store is always the lowest price but you can find almost anything here”

 I also purchased many many items with great success with out a single issue.  Sometime the shipping cost is advertised as free but when you order it changes to a fee. But you're in control since you have a option not to finalize the transaction at the very end. 
However be aware your purchase history is monitored and shared in the background.  
Just like other many other website monitored by the government and other sstatistically oriented consumer company's.  
Returns are average . Plea be aware there may independent sellers on Amazon that have different policies and so your experience can vary.

Steve,5,“Fast service and easy to use” 
6896,"I thought of Amazon as the huge online book seller for years and had noticed that they had begun to add more stuff.
I always have been a Walmart shopper, since Sam Walton was alive.
Most of you won't remember this but ""Sam"", that is what everyone called him, Sam would really promote one thing over price and convenience and anything else, and that was ""Made in America""
Walmart was built on the sales of Made in America, but almost immediately after the death of the patriarch of the Walton family, that mantra changed to "" Made anywhere but America"", then it changed again to ""Only Made In China"".
I understand that this is a global economy, I get that, but; without wage earners making stuff here in America, there won't be an American economy.
Our economy will be totally dependent on the economy of China, which is by the way still a Communist country.
Well, anyway Amazon has exploded into this giant powerhouse of a marketer over the last eight years, and their Amazon Prime, with the next day shipping is amazing.
I no longer go to the Walmart to pick up the odd item, I just go online and order it from Amazon, and in a day or two, there it is at my front door.
I was in my local Walmart today, because my grandson needed some construction paper for a project, and could not help but notice, the shelves were depleted and the store was in disarray.   Many of the shelves were empty and the store did not look as clean as it used to.
Who knows the reason... and maybe the floors at Amazon are just as dirty, and the shelves are just as empty, but when I need something, click the mouse, the screen says in stock, and boom it is on it's way.
I don't have to drive down to the store, find a place to park, then battle the people in the crowded aisles only to find the item I desperately needed was out of stock.
So I will continue to use Amazon, more frequently and watch for the drone to deliver my groceries in the future.

It is so easy to do.  Just type in your browser smile.amazon com instead of Amazon.com and make a difference in the lives of others.

7066,not sure why anyone would try Aliexpress...,5,“pretty good; mostly bottom pricing and quality service.” 
7067,"Whatever u want its on amazon!!
But contacting the customer support is a bit problematic , the information is hidden in some complex path on their site.
Also for many products the tracking information is not available on their page with the order information. After roaming here and there and going through some unknown paths had to find out the tracking information. It should be upfront available.",5,“the widest range u can imagine” 
7068,"Hard to imagine anyone hasn't shopped online at Amazon.com because they have almost EVERYTHING there. I have made hundreds of purchases at Amazon and never had a disappointment of any significance. 

I go to Amazon first when shopping for anything. Its unusual for me to not find several choices of whatever it is I am looking for. Its helpful to have a record of all my online purchases in one place and Amazon makes returns easy. There return policy is limited to 30 days, but if you have any problem at all with a product, they pay for the shipping by sending you a return postage stamp. If your return is your fault, you must pay the return shipping. All of this can be done online, but if you need to speak with someone you can do so via chat, email or a phone call. My experience has been that their customer service reps are excellent... well trained, proactive, considerate, and clearly ""on your side"". 

I am a Amazon Prime member, which means I pay about $80 a year to get free two-day shipping on my purchases. Not all products are available for Prime, but its been rare for me to pay shipping and I almost always enjoy my purchases in two days or less. Prime also provides other perks, like thousands of streaming videos and TV shows, free music downloads, and free Kindle books. I have been a Prime member for several years and its well worth it for me BECAUSE I AM A FREQUENT SHOPPER.

Amazon has a robust review system. Many items have hundreds of reviews and Amazon uses a ""verified buyer"" system to help you validate what you're seeing. Its easy to sort and read through their reviews. 

I ALMOST gave Amazon a 4 and not a 5 is because sometimes their prices are way notably higher than other places, even when compensating for the free shipping. Sometimes their prices are less than other smaller boutiques or stores, but the vast majority of the time they are comparable. After looking at the summary below where I gave them five stars in 4 of 5 categories, I figured a 5 would best represent my overall experience.

For me, the value Amazon provides is worth an extra few dollars every now and then. I know they will stand behind my purchases, that customer service will be accessible and of high quality (this is critical to me as a customer experience professional), that I will get my stuff when its promised, and that it will be easy to track my purchases down the line. 

Do beware that other sellers use Amazon to sell. I have done so myself and they have a strong system to enforce quality control. With that said, I am always careful to determine whether I am buying from Amazon, an Amazon re-seller or another entity all together. Some re-sellers have their own return and shipping policies, so be sure to check this out.  I tend to stick with the sellers backed by Amazon's policies, however, on many occasions I have used other re-sellers and have never had a problem.",5,"“hundreds of purchases, most seamless, excellent service, a few glitches” "

I buy clothes all the time through Amazon, and unlike my other review for dresslily - they have Hasselfree returns. During Christmas,  we purchased a planer for a gift and upon arrival saw it was much smaller than what the picture seemed to show.  We laughed,  because we couldn't believe anyone would be able to write plans in a book so small,  and the price was crazy for a book of blank pages so tiny.  So we filed for a return.  Amazon quickly refunded or money,  and told us to keep the tiny little planer.  It was so easy,  and has been everytime I have needed to do a return- which really hasn't been that often. If you have been living under a rock and have never shopped with Amazon -What are you waiting for.  Life is easy with Amazon ' s selection and 2 day shipping.  OH! ...

You have the option of buying books new or used, and they are priced accordingly. They seem to have contacts with quite a few businesses and people with books they are selling, available through Amazon. I would caution you, however, that just because someone is charging only $3.99 for an item,  does not mean that is how much you will end up paying. You will pay the listed amount PLUS how much they charge for THEIR Shipping and Handling Fee. Sometimes if you mailed a small book, it might cost you under $5.00 if you mailed it from the Post Office. For the exact same item, they often charge whatever they feel like charging, which means they could set their Shipping and Handling Charges as $39.95 for the same item. Add their ""Fees"" to what they stated was the price. Instead of the item costing only $3.99 plus tax, you might have to pay over $45.00. Sometimes if the Amazon book price is listed as $20.00, often with FREE Shipping, you can save a lot of money just to buy books ""New"" from Amazon.  Amazon is one of my favorite online buying resources.",5,"“I can't tell you enough great things about Amazon,...” "

All my shipments are quick and I've not had to send anything back. I had a easy time cancelling a subscribe and save (which is automatic shipments). My dogs loved a special treat and it was ONLY available on amazon.com. By finally placing it on subscribe and save I knew I'd have it. My first furbuddy died in February 2013 and my second November 2014, thus I had no need of this special treat shipping again. My new pup is not into treats. Amazon was more than understanding about cancelling any future orders. I just remembered they overbilled me once on these treats and were quick to just cancel the bill and have the vendor fix the site with the incorrect price.

As for pricing, they are not always the lowest price, but if it is a larger purchase, watch Amazon daily as the price tends to change often.  (Add it to your cart, and your cart will notify you of changes.)  One issue I have is with shipping--some packages arrive with the USPS doing the ""last mile"" of delivery, and I do not like the loss of tracking information, especially with the rash of package thefts in our area.

I thought the $99 for the new Prime was too much, but after paying for the shipping on just a few items, I went right back to the Prime.

Their prices can change for the better or worse - typically better. Customer service is great! I never had an issue with them. I have had issues with other things but they fix it right away. Amazon goes above and beyond to keep (most of) their customers happy. Some items offer free returns while some items do not. You usually have to pay for shipping for returns if you simply don't like the product. If there's any issues with the product, you can usually return it for no charge. Their fast shipping pretty much spoils me. When I purchase items from other websites, they usually take at least a week but it feels like forever.",5,“I love Amazon!”

My kids and I had a blast using it to slice and core our apples. Its super fast and easy. Just stand the apple up, put the apple slicer on top of the apple and push down. And waaalllllaaaa, your apples are sliced and de-cored. Brilliant! You will need to push down with a little force, (the handles are sturdy and comfortable to grab on to), and keep in mind the blades are super sharp, so once you get started the apple has no chance. I used a curved paper plate, so I turned my slicer upside down and just poked out the slices and core. Rinsed it off and stored it in the nice bag it came with. How cool is this! This is a must have kitchen gadget. My kids had fun using it to cut their apples, (by the way, I had no arguing over who was getting a bigger slice of apple since this cuts evenly) and I had fun cutting my work in half! If there was anything Id change about this product it would be to include directions. The free garlic peeler that came with this; I have not used yet since I am not sure how to use this product.

I purchased all kinds of stuff - electronics (computer, mouse, keyboard, headphones, webcam, bluray writer, USB flash, external HDD storage..), paper books, cosmetics, toys, shoes, accessories, jewelry and even bigger stuff like travelling luggage. 

I never had any kind of problem, not even once that I would be dissatisfied. Of course there happened to be issues, e.g. the computer mouse stopped working or I didn't receive some item in a period of time (I am sure the guard stole it or the delivery man lost it), and in those cases Amazon is always on the buyer's side. You return it for a reason or ask for refund for not-delivered item. Amazon's A-Z Guarantee always resolves problems in the best way.

The only thing you have to be careful about is the seller you're choosing to buy from. I am very picky and attentive in such matters, probably that's why my risk is at the minimum. Pay attention to the available photos of the product, product description, product location and certainly reviews and seller rating.

And surely you must familiarize yourself with rules of Amazon before you get in the game (e.g. Shipping Address cannot be changed after the item has been marked as Shipped), but that's what you signed for when you were agreeing to Terms and Conditions!",5,“I ordered from Amazon 76 times in the past 4 years”

I only had one semi bad experience on Amazon and it could have been the sellers deceit....I attempted to purchase an old video game but the seller sent me a piece of paper from the case (seriously..?) and when I checked my order again, it still showed that I was purchasing the video game.  Seller issues are sometimes handled by Amazon and although this wasn't entirely the case, Amazon did refund my money.  And yes, I returned the lame video game insert.  

I love Amazon for the free shipping, the ease of purchasing (dangerously easy), the trust that I have that I will always get what I order, and the movies/tv shows (especially since they made that deal and now we get all the HBO shows)!

7489,"I have to share my recent experience with Amazon.com.  I am still in shock and amazed how wonderful their Customer Service is!

A month ago, I placed an order with Amazon.  There were three boxes all shipped by UPS. One of the boxes, UPS delivered to the USPS for final delivery. This was the box that never arrived. I received a text from Amazon when it was delivered.  But, it hadn't.  It is a very long story of how bad USPS was to deal with about this ""lost"" shipment.

A few days later, quite upset with USPS, I emailed Amazon.  This was NOT their fault, nor was it the fault of UPS.  I told them that.  I was just upset I was out quite a bit of money and there was no delivery signature and I had no where else to turn for help.  Within one hour (literally!), I received the nicest email from Amazon Customer Service.  They credited back the money (it was ""in pending"" an hour later on my credit card account!), wanted me to re-order the items and included the links to those items in their email to me!  And, if that wasn't wonderful enough, they offered me free one-day shipping for ""my inconvenience""!  They also informed me that their shipping department would help locate that package with the USPS.

Today, three weeks later, I received another email from Amazon Customer Service.  Their shipping group received that ""delivered"" package and it was marked ""Undeliverable"" by USPS! 

A negative ten points to USPS, and, to Amazon, I am your customer for life!  You didn't have to reimburse me for my loss, but you did!  You were also able to take on the USPS when I was ignored by them.  I just had to share my story about how incredibly wonderful Amazon has treated me.

I am not an Amazon Prime member.  I am not one of their ""regular"" customers.  I may purchase from them a few times a year.  Yet, they treated me as if I was their most prized customer.  THANK YOU, AMAZON!",5,“I have to share my recent experience with Amazon.com”

The commission is pretty high, but i know that my item is going to sell fast and there is some convenience to it. If i ever had a problem, i rely on amazon customer support to fix it.

7584,"I had great experience using this meat thermometer, a magical device about which many people are still unaware. This gadget looks quite simple but its results are outstanding. It can help you to become and cook like a professional chef. Just like the waiter in a restaurant asks, how would you like your meat to be? You can ask a similar question to your guests. Wouldn't that be great? Your guests will be eating a perfectly cooked meat loaf. I use this wonderful gadget while cooking all types of meat, whether it's chicken or whether its beef, you can cook everything perfectly.
The basic structure of the meat thermometer consists of a Stainless steel probe that can measure upto 250 degree Celsius. This is the main role of the meat thermometer which let people like us who are fond of cooking, to cook a perfect steak or a meat loaf. I can easily insert the probe to the core of the meat and check what the exact temperature is inside. This helps me to cook the meat loaf perfectly and make my guests happy. Why this meat thermometer is better than the other ones available in the market. It has a remote receiver with it that works on 433MHz frequency and a range of 100 meters. It means that while my meat is cooking I can roam about and do my others tasks and there's no need to peep in to the BBQ or any other machines in which the meat is cooking.
As soon as the meat is cooked I get an indication because only this meat thermometer is laced with an alarm and a timer. It has 6 meat settings and 4 taste settings which have made my work easier. I can take my meat thermometer to the picnics and nightouts and I can be sure that this wonderful gauge and probe combination can make your meals part a memorable one. I also bought other meat thermometers earlier but I found that their functions were quite limited. One of my friends suggested me this one and found this one with multi-functionality. I bought it from Amazon. The best feature this meat thermometer has is the wide temperature range; it can measure from -10 degree C to 250 degree C (14 to 482 deg F). Believe it or not, this meat thermometer has made my life much easier and faster than before and I recommend this wonderful gadget to every lady who wants to save her time in kitchen and also cook a perfectly cooked meat for her family and friends.",5,"“I had great experience using this meat thermometer,...” "

You can find pretty much any item on Amazon, and you won't have to pay ridiculous retail prices for it. And I must say, whether I shopped with Amazon itself, or with an Amazon seller, i've always had a great shopping experience and received my items on time and in good shape.

And whenever I want to buy something, even in store, I check out its Amazon reviews. I find the reviews to be impartial and they usually give good pros and cons. Check out what people had to say for the Nook, for example. You'll find really insightful reviews that help you make the right purchasing decision.

So, if you haven't shopped on Amazon yet (trust me, i recently met someone who hadn't :), then what are you waiting for? ;) Best site ever. I'll be thrilled when they launch their online grocery site!",5,“Amazon is an absolutely wonderful website”

7613,"Amazon.com is the Internet's most trusted and reliable department store.  It's great not only for purchasing products and product research, but is also an effective place to conduct research on all types of topics.

Started as an online bookstore in Jeff Bezos' Bellevue, WA garage in 1995, when online stores of any kind were rare and novel, Amazon.com has become much more than merely the top place to shop for nearly anything.  Amazon.com has become a full-blown Internet portal to compete with Yahoo!, Microsoft and Google, offering account holders for free in many cases many cloud storage and processing services, as well as spawning or acquiring a diverse set of other, non-flagship online properties.

Many don't know Amazon has owned the popular and indispensable Internet Movie Database (imdb.com) since 1998.  They run alexa.com, providers of information about web traffic.  Amazon Mechanical Turk (mturk.com), wihose slogan ""Artificial Artificial Intelligence"" always gets a light chuckle from me, is a great place to make a little extra cash or find some humans to do tasks online that only humans can do.  Zappos.com is a repackaging of their shoe and shoe-related offerings.  And in 2013 Amazon.com gobbled up goodreads.com, a book lover's social networking site.

I'm sure they're not perfect, but speaking only for myself I have ordered many kinds items here and thee through the years and I have never had a problem.  Most recently I ordered my first 64-bit system in many different pieces and orders through them and all the parts have shown up on time or early and all the parts were what they were supposed to be, as, dealing with a firm as well-known and established as Amazon is, I expected them to be.",5,“Amazon.com is the Internet's most trusted and reliable...”

I've purchased many different categories of items and haven't had a bad experience yet.  I love that if you purchase $25.00 worth of products that say are eligible for Super Saver Shipping you get free shipping!  Just make sure that you check the box that says ""Super Saver Shipping"" at checkout!  I haven't tried Amazon Prime yet though so I can't comment on that program.  

I really enjoy having the choice to purchase some items new or used (music cds and books).  The great part is that some of these used items qualify for Super Saver Shipping which helps to save even more money!  There are buyer choices listed to click on for the prices of new and used items so you can scroll through to see which qualify.  The used listings also list the rating of the item; i.e. Used - Like New, Used - Good, Used - Acceptable.  There are other types but I didn't list them all here.  

They also have seller reviews for private sellers which includes their seller percentage rating.  It's a good idea to click on their profile to get a better idea of how many items they've sold and view some of their feedback to see if they appear to be reputable.

I find that Amazon is my first stop when I'm at the start of the research process for an item.  The user reviews are extremely helpful and I rely on them to help me make decisions on purchasing products whether I buy them on their site or not.  Amazon users!  Keep those product reviews coming, good or bad to help let other shoppers know what we as consumers think of their products!

The only warning I would give is that when purchasing through Amazon sometimes you are buying through another company that is listing their product on Amazon. You can see several companies may be listing the same item and you can chose which you prefer. The biggest problem is that people jump too quickly onto the cheapest price. Remember cheaper isn't always better look at the ratings and know that the reduced price could be because they have bad ratings so the price is to entice you over to them.

I always go with the more reputable option and to be honest the price difference is normally only a few dollars. Not worth the headache of chasing the other company down to get your order!",5,“Been using Amazon for years and have never had a bad...”

Many people have cut back on the luxury items and only focused on obtaining the necessities. Going to the movies with high priced tickets and popcorn was a luxury that many people cut back on.

As we began to embrace these cut backs we put together a list of websites to watch movies and/or tv on to little or no cost. We kept in mind a number of things such as affordability, reliability, clarity, and much more. Amaazon's instant videos are very easy to the navigate and sift through. The sites pros are that the prices for the movies are clearly displayed. They have a wide variety of free videos. It is a trusted and credible website that is not know to give viruses. It has great customer support. The cons is that all of the movies aren't free and the website doesn't have inviting and appealing colors that would make you want to log onto their website.

Great place to buy books, I've even sold a couple of text books there and got more than I could from the school bookstore even with the amzaon fee, I use it a lot to check out reviews before I buy products even if I don't buy them there...just can't say enough about it!

I have had a free prime membership for a year because I order diapers with them and I love that they usually have 20% off diapers in the parenting magazines since their diapers are already pretty cheap compared to most stores.  

During the holidays, an item I ordered was delivered according to UPS but I never received and amazon sent out a new item OVERNIGHT with no questions asked.  Not sure if it's because I order from them a lot or what but I was kind of surprised by their quick response since it was obviously not their fault that UPS delivered to the wrong house.",5,“I love this site” 
7869,"Excellent selections.  Excellent Service.  Amazon has made our providing computer services a whole lot easier over the last few years.  I'd have to honest say that They are cheapest 90 - 95% of the time we price shop.

Better yet, we are PRIME customers.  For only $69.00 (or so) a year, we get free 2nd say shipping or for $3.99 get overnight shipping.  Regardless the size or weight.  We are probably placing 10-15 orders per week, and to be frank, I know they are losing money on us when it comes to the PRIME account.  But they have no limit.

As far a 3rd party purchases, I have on occasion had a problem with the 3rd party vendor.  In every case it only took 1 email to Amazon and I got a refund within hours.

As far as the reviewer complaining about Amazon selling so much more than books ... that really is a silly complaint.  If you are searching, you can specify to ONLY search books.  Come on, if it bothers you that much, then go buy your books at Barnes and Noble ... and pay more.  In our case, about 98% or all purchases are NOT books.

Seriously, what's NOT to like about Amazon.

It can be annoying to browse for certain items, like trying to look for a diary with a day per page but their suggested items are very helpful and I sometimes end up buying more than I wanted, which isn't a bad thing - $25 and free shipping is always great!

7887,"I've been ordering items off Amazon for the past 6 years, and I have yet to have a bad experience with them (knock on wood). Eveything to college textbooks to TVs, it all been hassle-free. Granted there are times when items aren't shipped out as fast as Amazon says they will be, but if it's going to be late, Amazon has always sent me emails explaining it will be late. 

The trick to making the smaller purchases worth it, like one reviewer stated, is to order $25 worth of stuff in a single order to qualify for the free shipping. You have to wait a few extra days most of the time, but if you can put up with the wait, it ends up being a good deal.

My one complaint (annoyance really) about Amazon are the fluctuating prices. I've seen item prices start at a specific amount drop by $50, then jump up by $75, only to drop by $60. All in a single week. My opinion: if you're considering purchasing something large at Amazon, watch the price for a few days before you buy it. Nothing is more annoying than a price dropping $50 a day after you buy the item.

Amazon in my eyes outshines any other site that rivals it because of it's ability to help people sell their stuff in stores within amazon. The checkout process is quick and painless and the shipping process is above average for a website of it's size with super saver shipping to allow for the customer to save on shipping. The one thing I like the most is the ability to buy used over new stuff to save money and if the item is not what you wanted you can return it with out hassle. I give Amazon 4 stars for being one of the leading websites for the shopper in all of us.,5,“Amazon is a website for the masses” 
7930,"Amazon.com can be a great place to shop for a wide variety of products.  Their inventory is rooted from a vast number of suppliers and probably more often than not you're actually dealing with them more-so with amazon being a middle-man.

At least, it seems that way to me.

And so, Amazon.com can be a great place to buy things -- even toys.  However, the prices for such items can be a bit on the high-end depending on the product.   Prices can vary from ""new"" or even ""used"".

Where toys are concerned, the prices can be ludicrous depending on when it was issued.  Toys that were issued yester-year may be on the limited-side and will have their prices inflated.

Sometimes you can surf through the various vendors that a particular product is catered from, sifting through their prices.  Something to be mindful of is that one vendor may appear to be cheaper, but their shipping is higher.

Like ebay, you want to check on the feedback of the seller.  Believe of not, even they can disappoint at times.  It's rare, but I've had it happen.  Sometimes similar looking products can be mixed up and that whole bag.  It's not something to be worried about, but aware of what you're prodding at.

7948,"I LOVE amazon.com, which I can't say for a lot of websites, especially commercial ones where I find it hard entrusting my credit card information!

Basically, Amazon.com is a fun, safe, and easy-to-use place that remains huge and popular, so I always feel assured it's reputable and other people have used it to their satisfaction. This store sells many, many products that anyone can need or want. So far I've bought books, including countless textbooks for when I was in college; music CDs and downloads; movie DVDs (including downloads straight to my computer); at least 3 headphones; special personal products that I couldn't find in stores; and I'm sure more than I can think of right now. The first reason I used this site was its reliability. I learned that they worked as a broker with some of the most dependable third-party online sellers on the planet. That means they do their research on the sellers so I don't have. All I do is look at the sellers' star ratings without having to look to bbb.org.

Second, I used this site because of their consistent offer of the lowest prices that I still cannot match with other sites, no matter how hard I try, (which is a good relief when you have to buy expensive supplies in college!) Also, they have multiple payment options. Sometimes I don't have my credit card handy, so I use the bank account number that they already have stored (and safely stored, too).

Another HUGE highlight of Amazon is the extra information they give on the lower half of the product page that helps the customer make the perfect purchase, such as the customer reviews, discussion areas, and recommendations. I've avoided a lot of bad purchases just by reading Amazon's reviews alone. The special features go further. I have also taken advantage of their Free Super Saver Shipping on qualified products over $25 and at least one of their gift cards. One card I printed out at the last minute when I forgot to buy a real gift! 

As a seller, I've had great success getting rid of unwanted textbooks, music CDs, and a keyboard stand, without paying for a listing like on other sites. I did not make large profits off of all my sales, but that's only because Amazon offers extremely low prices. But I've still sold them to an extremely large pool of eager buyers all over the world. 

Amazon keeps me interested in the product that I'm buying and coming back for more. Sometimes I look on the site just for the product reviews or recommendations. I've stuck with this site for years now and I hope that I won't have to give it up anytime soon.",5,"“I LOVE amazon.com, which I can't say for a lot of websites,....” "

I like how they let other seller offer their products on amazon.com too next to Amazon's own product... this is how every website should be... fair and honest !",5,“No wonder Amazon is the number one shopping website...” 
7950,"I shop amazon for many many things. I'm always amazed at what you can find. The prices are always lower than what you get in stores. Of course, you HAVE TO BE CAREFUL about third party sellers. I see reviews saying they are never shopping at amazon again because of a third party seller ripping them off. RESEARCH THE SELLERS and make sure you have contact information! I, fortunately, have never had a problem, and have bought plenty from third parties. But I'm always careful and hesitant. Amazon as a whole has great product, great prices, and great customer service. Especially from their own selection instead of third party. A buyer always has responsibility. It's the same with any website.
I have refunded things and never had a problem. I've gotten my money back quickly and without delay or problem. 
If you're looking for something cheaper than what the price is in stores, chances are amazon has it. Great deals on books, dvds, blu-rays, and plenty of other things as well.",5,“I shop amazon for many many things”

7954,"What wouldn't I buy on amazon?!  This is the first place I stop before purchasing anything.  In my experience, amazon has pretty decent customer service if you can find the phone number.  There were several times that the item I purchased dropped in price and I was able to get a credit for my next purchase.  I purchased amazon prime this year and I'm hooked.  Most of my packages come in exactly 2 days!  For all the negative reviews of specific amazon sellers, although I haven't had a negative experience, I urge them to try to stick to products which have 'sold by amazon.com' in the description.  Make sure to post a negative review for the seller on amazon, because I believe amazon kicks them off after several bad reviews.",5,“What wouldn't I buy on amazon?!”

7956,"Amazon puts me at ease - Amazon has been a place which I started buying books from years ago, then graduated to music. Since 2007, I've been purchasing photo stuff from them. Today, I recieved a lens which I ordered last week, but the lens for some reason didnt communicate with my Canon XSi, got error messages. This is the first time ever that I had an issue with anything I got from Amazon directly or their vendors. 

I was a bit anxious about what might transpire now that I've received this item and it needs to be replaced. So, I started with their HELP pages for returns or credit, and an online email to them resulted in a reply within an hour stating that a new lens would be sent right away and that if I click on a web page which they gave, I could print out a free UPS shipping label to return the defective part. 

Since this is my first time ever having to deal with Amazon on a return, I have to say, its very impressive to see them respond so quickly and so positively without hassle or long protracted letter writing and phone calls.

My return is repacked ready to be dropped off at a UPS store or drop box, and my replacement lens has been shipped with a tracking number. They sent it at ""2nd Day Air"" with no charge to me. 

That is how businesses should conduct themselves and not make life miserable for a customer who is justified in returning a defective product. 

I am very impressed by Amazon, and if all turns out well as it seems to be, I will coninue to do business with them and will recommend them to others as well.",5,“Amazon puts me at ease”
