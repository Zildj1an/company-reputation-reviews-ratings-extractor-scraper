1,"I had a pre scheduled uber ride on 02/22/2019. I received a notice that the UBER driver, Charles had arrived at my home, but no UBER car outside. I walked the block to locate the UBER driver with no success. Then. UBER charged me for a missed ride. Bad UBER!!!",1,uber.com
2,"They never showed up for the taxis we booked, they cancelled them and then charged me each time Â£6 cancellation fee. My clients were 45 minutes late as a result of me having to keep rebooking taxis with them. As a result I lost a large contract, as well as them trying to continually take payments from my account until my bank stopped all payments. When I complained about this issue I have have had no resolution and they still owe me a significant amount of money. We will never use them ever again. Trust your local taxi firms instead to turn up and not rip you off.",1,uber.com
3,"I'm a frequent uber user and I had no problems until this uber pool decided to introduce the short walk crap. I'm always having issues with the drivers, as I see an address and the driver sees another address. And a cancellation fee? Are you serious? There are many incompetent drivers out there so why do I have to pay $5 fee when they cancel? I'm saying bye to this service and I will make sure all my friends are aware of your games.",1,uber.com
4,"I am no longer a Uber rider anymore. They are admit that they did no wrong and that it could be my banks fault when clearly it's not. They are such screw overs, it's unbelievable... lost 27 dollars. They charged me $13.13 for a ride back to where I had to be at that time. The driver canceled and there was a cancelation fee of $5.00. So, I should've at least been given back $8.13, but I thought it was going to take some time to process. So after that ride was canceled, I had to call for another Uber driver, which cost $14.63 that one went pretty well. So, I checked my bank account when I got to my destination and saw that the money that I owed was already taken for that second trip, which was of course okay. But, the $8.13 was never given back to me. I then check mid-day yesterday and saw that the full amount of $13.13 and 14.63 was refunded to me and there were no pending signs or anything indicating that it wasn't set in stones. I checked my bank account today and saw a drop in the amount of money I originally had in my bank account. The history of the $13.13 refund was no where to be found and saw that the $14.63 was refunded to me TODAY and then taken out of my bank account TODAY. As much as it sounds weird, that is exactly what happened! They should be giving back that $27.76 that they charged me. They never sent a notification saying that they were going to so, and taking money out of my bank account like it's a toy, because it's not.",1,uber.com
5,"When Uber runs over its customers. Buyer betware - Ueber is not all that is seems. At first I liked it. Ninety percent of the drivers are decent hard working honest people. But it's a crap shoot. I'd estimate ten percent are unscroupulous and should you ride with one of them Uber has no customer support. There's no phone whereby you can reach the driver or company. Case in point: Take Bill an apparently affable guy who will offer you a beverage on the way to your destination. Bill drives a Grand Cherokee and all indicators indicate that he is a criminal or accomplice to a crime. When Bill dropped me off at Planet Fitness I immediately noticed I left my bag containing an IPod and Bose headphones in the back seat. About $600 worth of equipment. I tried to wave him down but he wouldn't stop. Since then I have sent over 30 texts to him, the local Ueber office, and the corporate hub in Stamford. I even asked the Stamford police to investigate. As of this moment neither Bill nor Uebr care about larceny and they have no moral compass or desire for customer service. The car will get you from point A to poing B but after that your on your own. Uber won't lift a finger to help. Do you reaally want to take a chance with this company when you have your wallet, or keys, or handbag, or smartphone, or lose engagement ring on your finger? The smart answer is no. Bill is still out there. Lyft is the same as Uber. I'll check later today but smart money says they are much more conscientious than Uber who thinks its customer service is of no importance, even when expensive items disapper in one of their cars.",1,uber.com
6,My rating keeps going down every time I ride. I am a pleasant customer. Either uber app is messed up or something else. Why no promotion's or discounts? I have been using it for past 2 years and no discounts. HuH! avoid.,1,uber.com
7,"Uber charged me twice for the same ride and then told me one of my friends or my family must have used my charge account to book the second ride to the same place on the same day and they even added a tip for the driver of the ride I did not take. Uber's advertisement that you can now CALL Uber for customer service is a bald faced lie, there is no phone number and no customer service by phone whatsoever. Uber's business model is based on lies, dishonesty, and illegal behavior as anyone who follows current news can see.",1,uber.com

10,"It's a bad company and the pay sucks. Uber clams that your in independent contractor but in reality your a total employee to them. Example Uber controls your account, the support line sucks, they are a waste of my time. I highly recommend everyone don't ever work for these thieves. My account is on hold for over a week and half for yearly background check up. I did nothing wrong these $#*!heads are pissing me off. They don't pay anything to the unemployment which means no support for you when they hold you account. Uber is a Nasty DEVIL!",1,uber.com

Choose your merchants wisely!",1,uber.com
12,"I wouldn't even give this ""company"" one star. First of all, their drivers always cancel my pool trips because they don't want to do pool trips and then I have to deal with the cancel fee and the trip money they take. Apart from dealing with this all the time, about a month ago I was out with a friend and my phone wasn't working so my boyfriend called an Uber for me, about a week later we realized that they had taken $150 out of the account because of some cleaning fee. They sent us a picture that looks like someone spilled water on the door and they said that was the reason. So we told them that I didn't do that and that that could be some random picture taken by their driver and they didn't care. They are not giving me my money back. They didn't even send me an invoice detailing the reason why they were taking that money, I had to ask them. So they basically stole my money. Be careful people. This guys don't care about you, they just want your money. I already deleted my account, I'm riding with Lyft from now on, I've never had a problem with them.",1,uber.com
13,"My account was cloned, so I have having money taken out of my account for Uber trips and Uber Eats that I did not make/have. I tried using their Uber_support twitter account, and received the same automated message over and over. I then wrote back, and didn't get a reply. I then replied to my reply, and my issues was apparently taken to the appropriate team. Who then sent me the same automated message. I tried to again explain my concerns, but continued to received the same automated message. The charges still continued to come out of my account. When I messaged them about this, guess what.....THE SAME AUTOMATED MESSAGE. Terrible customer service!! If I could have given 0 stars that's what it would have been.",1,uber.com
14,"I would give Ron, uber driver from Sante Fe negative stars if I could. On Oct. 12, 2018 we requested a uber driver to take us from our hotel to Sante Fe airport at 5:30am.The driver showed up, and intrduced himself as Ron. He seemed nice enough. My wife and I got in back, and proceeded to the airport. As we're driving, my wife and I are making small talk with him(where you from, how long you been an uber driver, and so on. Said he was from NY, and had been driving for uber in Sante Fe for 4 years. He started talking about tips, which I thought was very inappropriate. He said he buys water and hand sanitizer for his customers. I said ya, looks like a wet bar back here(lol). His demeanor quickly changed. He said "" you people are invading my privacy."" HUH! You ""have no bussuiness invading my privacy RIGHT, RIGHT"" (yelling at us) SCARY! We said we're just making small talk as he continued to yell at us. Finally, I told my wife I need to record this. He heard this, pulled over, and told us to get out. It was 5:45am, 40 degrees in an area that was dark no street light or bussinesses miles from our destination.He opened my wives door, and rudely told her to get out. He threw our luggage into the street and drove away. My wife is 65, and has a sling on her arm after a surgery. We didn't know what to do. It was our first uber ride, and I'm pretty sure our last.",1,uber.com
15,"Sorry i have to review Uber Eats on this site, but cannot find any way to write a review on uber.com or ubereats.com Pathetic! Speaking of pathetic, my Eats order was delayed 5 minutes at a time for over an hour, and then the order was cancelled. BY UBER!! WTF?! As the customer, i thought i was the one who could cancel. I've never been fired by a merchant. I spoke with both Mae and Jose (a girl) and they even told me they have had similar experiences as ""customers"" of Uber Eats! Seriously?! when your own employees complain about their employer, things are broken!",1,uber.com
16,"I took an Uber to the hospital but left my expensive cardigan in the car. I contacted the driver immediately from information provided in the app. He confirmed he had the cardigan. He said when he is back in my area he would drop it off. I did not hear back for a while so contacted him again. He said he would drop it off to me but I'd have to pay almost Â£45 for the trip or he ca drop it off at the Uber offices in Canary Wharf. I then asked he drops it off at Canary wharf. I also asked that he let me know the details I will need to collect the item. My fare to the hospital was Â£7 by the way. Anyway, the driver whose uber user name is ""Abobacar"" stopped responding to me. I contacted Uber and they said they had tried to contact him to no avail. So I suggested that they switch his access off to force him to come to the office but they did not respond to that request instead they pretended they could do nothing and that the driver is self employed so there's nothing they can do. I filed a Police report and the Police said they had a duty to resolve the issue on my behalf. I relayed the message to Uber but they declined. A few weeks after, Abobacar contacted them and claimed he was in an accident and that when he got the car back the cardigan was missing. So I asked if his insurance would pay for the missing item, they did not respond to that. The moral of the story is, if you have a problem with an Uber driver Uber will do absolutely nothing to help you resolve it. They appear to have a finders keepers policy. It is disgraceful. I still use Uber but will switch to a competitor as soon as I get a chance to find one. Also, I will send an invoice to Uber as advised by the police. I will follow up with feedback at a later date. Beware of ""ABOBACAR"" the Uber driver!",1,uber.com
17,"Uber Support in USA is basically bunch of incompetent idiots. They are polite, and that is only positive thing one can say. But they have no clue about anything, totally useless and waste of time.  My experience: I was having problem with uploading documents and updating account. (I uploaded documents, but it was not getting approved even though everything was in order). I called Uber support 1-800-593-7069 -  First time I called, they reviewed documents, told me everything is fine and it will be approved within 2 hours - Next day I called again (as it was not approved) , they reviewed documents, told me everything is fine and it will be approved within 24 hours - It was not approved so I called third day, now they told me they can not approve it and I need to go to Greenlight hub in Toronto, to submit documents there , do (again) background check (even though nowhere on web site was asking for it)  -  I did go to Greenlight hub in Toronto 9 days ago. They were fast, professional took my documents, updated it, did a background check and said it will be 5 days to get results but after that it is all good and I should be able to continue driving with no problem -  (because you can not phone to Greenlight hub in Toronto) I called Uber support today hoping to be able to verify simple thing : Did they get results of background hack and if everything is okay. Incompetent loser on the other side took a time to ""check"" and then said background check is okay but he kept repeating like a parrot "" we are in process of reviewing and it might take 7-15 business days"" . What are they reviewing he was not able to explain.  Conclusion: calling Uber support is total waste of time, they are useless bunch of morons",1,uber.com
18,A promotion was offered in my area to sign up as a driver for uber 200 dollars extra if 100 rides were completed in a month... I completed 100 rides in 10 daysbut never recieved my bonus...

20,"They have little to no customer service. They have no actual person that you can speak to. They make it almost impossible.

21,"Car number plate: GFI4CZK This may not reflect the whole of UBER, however, as my first and subsequentially last UBER ride, I think its safe to say this driver was enough to turn me against using it ever again. First, he tried to overcharge my us for our luggage (literally 4 shopping bags), despite it fitting with an excess of room, then he refused to take us when we refused to pay the overcharged amount. Rude and horrible experience which reflects poorly on the whole company. Would recommend UBER to start sufficiently interviewing their drivers so we, as customers, do not have to put up with such disgusting manners which utterly ruined my day. It may be amazing in the US but in the UK you are graced with the most shocking drivers who have no concept of customer service.  If you use UBER and get this number plate, then save yourself the bother and find another car.",1,uber.com
22,"While visiting Nashville for a concert on August 25th, I scheduled an Uber ride at the quoted rate (iPhone app) of $21.xx. We traveled from 5th avenue, not far from Bridgestone Arena to the Gaylord Hotel. Upon arrival, I tipped the driver in cash, and we exited the vehicle. A few seconds later, I received a notification that I had been charged $79.72! Uber informed me that there was a ""surge charge"" (which I had never heard of) and that it is applicable, essentially when there are very few drivers available, relative to the number of riders needing rides. Supposedly, the rider is notified of the surge charge before accepting or rejecting the ride, but I wasn't. I was simply told ""$21.xx"", then charged $79.72.",1,uber.com

The first time they tried to say it was just an ""authorization"" if it is just an ""authorization"" WHY ARE THE FUNDS COMING OUT OF MY ACCOUNT?! This time, they haven't even replied yet.

30,"It has been over THREE weeks now and I have been told several different times by the Uber support team members that someone from their insurance adjuster's office will contact me within 2-3 business days. This has yet to happen. My shoulder is still in severe pain and I do not have insurance to have it looked at. They just keep ignoring me. ORIGINAL MESSAGE TO UBER SUPPORT "" Hello, I was picked up yesterday (06/27/2018) at 12:04 in front of the *** in Colorado Springs, CO. I wanted to bring to your attention something that happened concerning this ride. The driver was great and got me to my job interview on time! However, when he picked me up, I had my backpack and duffel bag with me because I didn't have time to take it to my storage unit first. Well, he drove a **** which is a very large truck. As I approached the truck he rolled down the window and said that I can just put my stuff in the back of the truck. So I walked around to the passenger side and proceeded to do so. The duffel back was extremely heavy and I had to lift it up to my head and lean over holding it up just to get it into the back of the truck. Lowering the duffel bag in, I got an extremely sharp pain in my left shoulder like something tore--it knocked the air out of me. I squeezed my shoulder and tried to catch my breath. Then I placed my backpack into the back of the truck and got inside and we left. I was running late to my job interview so that was my only concern at that moment. I think the driver noticed what happened because once he dropped me off, he quickly jumped out of the truck and replied: ""here, let me get that bag for you."" Anyways, I thought it was just a minor injury and that it would be fine by the next morning. Sadly, that is not the case. I was up most of the night because I couldn't sleep on my left side at all and anytime that I turned on my side the pain woke me up. I can no longer lift my left arm above my head or reach for anything without screaming in pain. Because of this, I am terrified that this is going to interfere with any possible job duties, if hired, and/or prevent me from passing any physicals should any job require one. I am writing you this because I just can't stop worrying how this is going to affect me. I'm homeless and I need to work and it terrifies me that this is going to prevent that from happening. "" This is the same blanket email that I get from Uber every time I ask them why no one is contacting me: ""...an insurance adjuster will contact you in 2-3 business days to discuss the details and claims process... Thank you for your patients."" Now, it has been nearly a month and the pain is only getting worse. Uber just keeps blowing me off hoping that I will just go away. Well, if this pain would go away then so would I!",1,uber.com
31,"DON'T EVER USE UBER!!!! They don't hold any of their drivers accountable for their actions and they are dismissive and unprofessional when you try to contact them to resolve an issue or complaint! I had an uber driver damage my BMW in a hit and run and uber did NOTHING to resolve the issue. They couldn't even apologize on her behalf! I had a description of the driver, her SUV, video footage from the hotel, witness statements, pictures of her car before she fled and they still can't compensate me in any way, let alone apologize! I mentioned that I had to seek medical attention and they don't show any sympathy or concern for my well-being! If this driver didn't have something to hide (i.e. drunk, drugs, weapons in the car etc) then why would she run knowing there were cameras at the hotel and multiple staff who saw her and told she was wrong and she saw me taking a pic of her SUV!? What's even more ridiculous is they don't consider their drivers as their ""employees""!  Read this for yourself ""Driver-partners are considered as independent contractors and not employees. This technically means that driver partners are not employed by Uber Technologies, Inc or one of its respective company subsidiaries. Also, please be advised that the Incident response team is the sole entity in charge of handling all accidents and property damage claims. All claims that we handle are processed based on facts, reason, and logic. This being said, some customers that are emotionally invested in the situation can take this as a lack of empathy.

There was an option to ""Skip this Step"" so I did. I never got a screen telling me my total or asking me if I agreed to book it or not. Just that the car was on its way. The car that arrived was a huge SUV that could probably seat at least 8 people (I was alone and had one small piece of luggage and a backpack), and when I looked at the receipt later, I saw that they charged me $150 for this unnecessarily huge vehicle.

38,My friend spent her 21st birthday clubbing and by the end of the night she was puking. Our Uber driver came to pick us up knowing we had a night of partying and a sick friend. On our drive home he stopped to let her puke. However she did puke on the outside and made a small mess in the car. After our trip I cleaned up everything inside it car as quick as I could. Then a week later we were charged with $150 for cleaning along with the charge of the trip for a very very minimal amount of puke on the seat belt and the outside of the car. We gladly would have paid 50 dollars for clean up however no matter what way we spun it definitely didnt cost 150 dollars to clean a car.

This ruined my daughters Prom, we had to ask a neighbor if they would mind taking them to the Prom. I find this to be so unprofessional. They ended up getting to the Prom about 1 1/2 hour late, missed meeting up with some of their friends to take group pictures.

I will never use UBER again - every time I tried to add my home address, it would find it on the map and then when I would try and add it to my favorites, it kept adding a different address with the same street name in Toronto. I live north of Ottawa 4.5 hours away!!!!!!!! but that wasn't clear from their app because on the list of favorites it only shows the street name and not the town. When I first got in the Uber car, the guy went WOW , you want a drive from here to Toronto... that's 4.5 hrs. He had to manually enter the address in his system. then when I selected a 15% tip at the end of the trip, it calculated it on a fair for the original 4.5 hour trip. the $62 flashed by and I said wait a minute..It can't be that much?? He should me that the fair was $14 on his system and Uber only adds 20% so it will be less than $20. I said are you sure? He said yes. I felt dumb because it was only the second time I had used Uber so got out. After he left, I double checked my phone and saw that yes the fair was $20 but a tip of $62 was added even though I chose the 15% tip option. It must have calculated it on the original 4.5 hour fair. Now they will only give me a credit on my Uber account and NOT a refund on my card. On top of that his car was old and rattled although he was nice enough. the whole experience was bad.

77,"I received e-mails from Uber asking me why I do not take Uber anymore. There is no way to reply to - they only SEND emails, they DO NOT ACCEPT e-mails. 1. AUTOMATED customer service is the biggest problem of Uber. That is the first reason for which I stopped taking Uber. I tried to call Uber when in need. I found with difficulty a number on the web. I called it and a stupid message said: ""Don't bother leaving a message, there are 20,000 messages in this mailbox"". Whoever left that message was a major $#*!, Probably Travis Kalanick or one of those cocky bastards that Uber has plenty of. 2. Uber VERY POOR customer service has cost me $ 650. In May 2016 I forgot my new iPhone ($650) in the Uber and there was NO WAY to retrieve it - there is NO Uber phone customer service where one can talk to a live person and explain the problem. That's a big flaw. I called Uber automated customer service from a hotel and never received an answer. I e-mailed multiple times, I left feedback over the Uber website. I received a response only TWO DAYS afterwards. Of course, TWO DAYS afterwards my iPhone was long gone. That is why Uber poor customer service has cost me $ 650. Uber has not offered me any compensation for that - and THE SAME THING can happen again.  3. The cars are often dirty. I initially switched from taxis to Uber because I cannot stand taxis that are dirty and smell of food because the driver eats in there. However over time the Uber has started being just as bad. There is no quality control of car. I have had dirty Uber cars, or banged up Uber cars or drivers that couldn't follow a GPS and took much longer than they should have. The dirtiness is by far the biggest problems. In contrast, Lyft has CLEAN cars. It enforces cleanliness. 4. I do not care about the negative press that Uber has had. However, I do care very much about: - the car being CLEAN, with NO FOOD SMELL - the driver that knows how to drive and follow a GPS. - your having an ACTUAL customer service. It is impossible to e-mail Uer - though uber DOES send email to you.  Until Uber solves these problems, I will no longer take Uber cars.

85,"I have been a loyal user of Uber and it has always been my go-to means of getting from point A-B. But today, I've officially withdrawn and deleted their app. Heres why: Two nights ago, I've ordered a cab for my girlfriend to get home after a huge argument around the time of 3 a.m. Keep in mind her phone died at the time. Her destination was from Manhattan to Brooklyn. The next day, she had told me she was dissatisfied with a pool customer who gave her an attitude and told my girlfriend to ""shut up"" after talking to the driver named Raja. She was tremendously upset to begin with and it caused her to get off the car a few blocks later, which took her to the 1 train. We are super easy going people and we have discovered the driver Raja, has NEVER ended the trip at the time she was dropped off- which was only 5 blocks later and had fully taken advantaged of the circumstances and drove an empty passenge car to her destination in Brooklyn. I did not fully realize this until it was too late - so I had rated him 5 stars before I got the chance to report him. Again we were in an argument so we didn't not talk until a day later. First of all she and I were not drunk at all. And I have reached out to uber and they have refused to refund me for the amount of $27. Although the money is not the issue but the dishonest driver. I will be going to Lyft from now on. I do not regret my decision. Also I notified uber and told them the details and these illiterate workers reviewing my complaint do not even respond to the problem but are confusing that I want a refund because the fare amount itself is wrong. I regret to say that Uber hires lousy drivers that take advantage of customers at 3am. and if they had looked into my transaction profile, I already spend quite a lot for cabs, theres no reason for me to go beyond for 27$ unless it was the truth",1,uber.com

89,"I will and always have admitted, it's not about loyalty but business. I supported uber in the past because they were getting the job done better than the cab companies. And in a sense they are still more efficient than the dying breed of the cab industry. However there are and will continue to be more rideshare business. Look what Napster did to the music industry and look where Napster is now?  Uber has gone down hill for me as this whole rating thing has gotten out of hand. I am on time for my driver, respectful (treating them the way I want to be treated), and despite not liking the tipping I still do it. I don't like the rating as it's pointless. If I give the driver a bad rating legitimately they will and have rated me poorly. Anything less than a 5/5 for a driver is ""wrong"". So the passenger gets bullied into giving them a perfect score. Then there is this tipping which I have been in the service industry and support it but UBER was all about the no tipping and now if you don't tip enough or worse on time, the driver rates you poorly. Personally, I don't care if a drive likes me or not but when my rating can impact me getting a ride, this is where the problem is. Some examples I dealt with is I had a driver in Montreal who didn't speak English and I did the best I could to communicate in French and so my rating goes down. In Phoenix, my driver was soliciting his private driver business and when I couldn't use his same thing. And most recently in Seattle one driver was so depressing talking about how she has no friends and that she doesn't know Seattle well. I had to end up using my own gps using international Data and yet now I get a bad review. I was scared to give this lady a 4/5 yet alone worse. And I have gained other example. I have supported UBER coming to Calgary and Edmonton, even when they were booted out temporarily. Now that I live near Vancouver, I was supporting them coming there as well. Now, I'm starting to change my mind. My point is now I'm considering going with other options including the awkward hailing of a cab! Regardless, ride sharing will continue to grow, the question is, will UBER be a part of this or eventually not exist like Napster, being just another company that started a trend? FYI they make it hard for you to contact them with complaints unless you say you were in an accident.",1,uber.com
90,"My son booked me an Uber to take me to the station to catch a train to the airport. When I got in the driver started going at about one mile an hour and drove up loads of little side roads, going round in circles in completely the wrong direction and wasting a good 15 minutes. When I told him I had a train and flight to catch he suddenly said he was looking for other customers because it was a shared ride. I rang my son who said it definitely wasn't shared and to tell the driver to get a move on. He refused to. I asked could he then change it to unshared and charge the extra and he said no. I asked him to call his superior and he said there was nobody there to call. I explained that if I missed the one train an hour I'd miss my flight and there wasn't another one for seven days. Effectively I'd lose my whole holiday. He shrugged and carried on at one mile an hour. There was nothing I could do and even if I'd got out of his car he'd taken me down such quiet roads there was no chance of finding another cab. This was 3am in the morning and eventually after much screaming on my part he gave up looking for sharers - but I made it to the station with two minutes to spare and had to to try and run up numerous platform steps with two pieces of heavy luggage.

The trip started on my account but the drivers account was not updated. navigation kept directing the driver to my pick up point. finally after taking a full circle and wasting my time he called up customer service. the executive directed him to cancel my ongoing trip and ask me to book another assuring that the same cab will be assigned. the driver cancelled and when i booked again i was assigned a ride 20 min away. the driver asked me to get off on the street amidst a downpour. when i refused to get off away from my pick up point, while it was raining and demanded to talk to customer service again, the driver called up the office again but refused to let me speak. customer service executive told him to tell me that i am not being charged for the trip so get off. I have never seen such behavior in my life. the moment you undertake the responsibility of a trip, you are taking responsibility for our time, safety and good service delivery and in return take payment from us. you cannot waste our time, compromise our safety and then put us through discomfort and finally say 'ok we won't charge you this time'. looks like uber is no better than a bunch of scoundrels with no work ethics or standards.",1,uber.com

It's just ridiculous. Glad all the Sr. leaders of the company resigned or were fired. Hopefully it changes the culture, but I doubt it, all the customer service reps are nasty ass offshore peeps that don't care about anything but their ""ticket resolution"" numbers.",1,uber.com

103,"For all there data, which is impressive, they have no idea or are just plain heartless, that taxis drive 19.1 mph. Which translates to $13.62 per hour. The same # all the other drivers mention. I am giving it up and I work mostly in the Hamptons, NY, where they raise the rate 60-70% to $22.31 per hour. People have no problem paying more ant the Hamptons rate should be the BASE rate. Basically this app sucks. I agree with a previous review that said you make pennies. Consider this, you drive 12 min to pickup, do a 5 min fare, and collect $3.67. BTW, you have no idea where you are going. So now you are 5 min further out of your way. Stay on the N. Fork (LI) and do garbage fares for $13/hr or drive to the S. Fork with nothing? Nobody tips, 8% of people. Sure it's in the app, but I could not find it for my fare in their phone. Sure you work the ""Surge"" 1.8X, wow, now you make $20 and hour and get a red light ticket/pulled over because you don't know where you are. Not to mention, you never work a surge for an hour because it disappears as you approach, they know you are coming. Therefore to make money, you turn off the app....no you don't make money or work that hour for a surge. BTW there are 1000 ubers around you at all times, watching the ants on the consumer app drives you nuts. Lyft shows you were they are at any location: another form of torture as it confirms your good spot is taken up by 23 Lyfts (which is about 60% of the Uber fleet). 3 Long hauls to NYC for a ""Bro price"" which not only includes gas, but lunch too: 2:35 hours to make $82, or 1:05 to make $80 when picked up in the Hamptons. I complained about the 82 fare, Uber said it was Kosher: sure I dropped at LaGuardia AND MIDTOWN in rush hour, no worries. Sat night I earned $296 in the Hamptons, minus gas in 10 hours. I KNOW THE HAMPTONS and have driven taxis since '99 part time. This is what a good driver gets for driving 300 miles. Every night I drive is 250-300 miles. 1000's of miles add up. Uber will get you out of a financial jam, and I will use it on MONGO nights: Concerts/Labor day, but it sucks and they have no problem having it suck for the driver, evidenced by the fares. That's all I got...oh yeah, premium/select drivers do 10% premium fares (30% of their profit), but do 90% of the base x fare. So they make....$18 per hour to pay for their Mercedes:) or grind it into dust. XL Fares are few and far in between, unlike gas stations for my Yukon. My car was a Charger 25 mpg+. NO Money in it. As the last fare said, give this up...and wait tables. I did get $210 for the puker in my car from S.Hampton, same care I put my kids in.......delete the app is what I should do.",1,uber.com

If an incident happens and you try to get information they automatically assume you are guilty. I was recently sexually harrased by one of my customers while driving I noticed Uber of the situation and they brushed if off basically saying it was my fault and I should have not interacted with the customer. The immediately deactivated my account without giving me any notification and then stated I was under investigation I called the company and all I got was the run around someone will get back to me.

It willl not allow a promotion code to be accepted. Communication thru the app is rigid and tortuous and the usual 800 number in the charges description won't allow any incoming calls only refers you back to their app which is worthless. And to top it all the second driver's conduct and dress code was second rate to put it mildly. Thank goodness for Lyft which I have been using all along without any problems whatsoever.

This isn't fair- please check driver's phone or how he did it. And he didn't show me that he completed the trip and Once I got out of the car he did something on his phone. Same time I thought that something was wrong . now I can't trust Uber at all. They charged me four times the fare I was supposed to pay and they didn't even confirmed me .I was shocked to see the email of 401Rs. That's ridiculous.

111,"First and foremost, in India there is no customer care service from UBER. There is just a help tab through which we can raise a complaint and that will be solved after 24hrs (taking their sweet time to respond). If a customer is in a deep trouble there is nobody to help. That pathetic ""HELP"" doesn't help actually. There were multiple issues I have faced with UBER. But, today it was disgusting. I got ill because of the $#*!ty freshener used in the cab. Apart from that driver had stopped the car in the middle, ended the trip and told me to get down at the unknown place because I was ill. And I was helpless because UBER has only ""HELP"" tab which doesn't work at all at the time of need. He denied to take me to the destination as he had some other work. when I insisted him he told I'll take you to the X place (where he had some work) and then I'll drop you to the destination. He forced me get down. I had to taxi from that place to my destination (Thanks to God I found a taxi over there), by the way I was charged for this trip which was equivalent to trip charge. Who is going to help in this. This is not the end yet. As the driver had ended the trip I was wrongly charged (more than what it is at time of booking) whose fault it was?? Driver was rude & abusive - UBER has ""HELP"" tab for your security. I have raised many requests on UBER ""HELP"" till now no help. One more important thing ""TIME"", nobody cares. Because of abrupt ending of the trip I reached my destination very late. Who is responsible?? This is not the first time I was wrongly charged, it has become usual.

121,"I had just arrived from the airport for my trip and was super excited to begin my vacation. However, my friend and I called for an Uber...which I highly regret now...that totally switched my happy mood into pure frustration and put me into the worst mood possible... My friend had took my phone to call for an Uber. The Uber driver was very poor at communicating his destination. After waiting around for a bit, we told him we were at the gate that he told us to be waiting for him after running there in a hurry. He was very short and rude in the manner in which he communicated. Once I told him we were in arrivals, he told us that he said to be departures and cancelled the ride, and Uber had to audacity to charge me for NO service!  In the normal world, when people arrive at a destination from a flight, they get picked up in ""arrivals"". I tried to contact Uber, but apparently they do not have a real phone line to call customer support. Trying to get my money back was such a pain and ruined the whole start of my trip. All I wanted was my money back, and I probably would have been fine and a little irritated about the experience but probably would of still continued to use Uber if they had simply refunded me....However, they would only give me ""Uber credit"" to use on my next trip and still charged my card. I told them to remove the charge from my card, but they said that was ""against their policy"".  I have talked with a few others that have similar situations happen to them, and they were able to get full refunds for their charged cancellation...but I don't know why refunding my card in particular was against their policy. Seems as if the company picks and chooses who they want to refund...which wouldn't qualify as a ""policy"".  I guess they would prefer to lose a customer to a competitor than refund a simple $5 cancellation. That simple $5 costs them close to $200 in lost revenue just for that weekend with all of us using Lyft and other transportation services instead. My first Lyft ride was really great, the driver had even given us complimentary waters and protein bars and his car seats were actually cool massage chairs! Back to the point, Uber is not a good company...there are sooo many things that are wrong with them aside from stealing money from customers. They prefer employees that are greedy and will do anything at all costs to get ahead.

128,"I use Uber in China, Australia, India and UK and have found them to be reasonable up until now. I took an Uber in Brisbane recently and the driver was terrible. My female companion complained to the driver about his erratic unsafe driving in general, his ignoring of the navigator, ignoring of directions. Uber driver, knowing he would get a one star rating, then complained about us both making 'racist' remarks. I have no idea of what nationality the driver was, it was not even on my radar. My companion sits on University Boards and other Government agencies and is listed in top women business leaders, I also am on similar boards, travel extensively through Asia, Europe and India, we both have no racist comments to make, but we are immediately, according to Uber, guilty. Uber suspends account without discussion with me and then after only sending condescending patronizing emails 'about their community' as they are now also the new warrior and standard setter of community political correctness and protector of multiculturalism, supposedly 'unblocks' my account but it will not work. Despite trying several times to contact them to resolve, emails are answered, one of our team will be in touch, still waiting. Uber's arrogance knows no bounds, they answer to no one but themselves, they are not only condescending in their attitude, they make public claims which they do not back up.  As they have to answer to know one except their own falsely manufactured 'community' which standards are set by a mutli-national based on profits, not moral or a code of conduct that has checks and balances denying a process for right of reasonable reply nor natural justice to their passengers. Their complaint service is purposefully designed to avoid human contact so they can make their morally one sided incoherent biased judgement in complete isolation and then make unfounded derogatory unable to be replied to judgments that if I knew who it was I would complain to the HRC. As they have no responsibility to local authority nor reasonable codes of contact and conduct, do not expect a fair go from Uber and do your best to out them as a self serving corporate usurer of community standards for their own profit motive while making false claims against real people of high standing in real communities, expose them for the hypocrites they are.

131,"I spent over an hour of my personal time seeking the lowest fare to the airport following meetings in Grand Rapids, MI. I'm a government employee, and every dollar counts. Out of over 30 options reviewed, UBER was by far the cheapest at $16 from downtown. Next best was $20, and then the others hovered around $35-45. Google revealed the secret technique on how to preorder a 5:15am Uber the night before. Out of the shower I spy a circa 5:15am. text that, due to SURGE PRICING, my 5:25am fare would now be 3.5x what we had agreed to the previous evening, and I had 5 minutes (already spent in the shower) I could cancel without being charged a fee. The soonest cab ($40 fare) was 20 minutes away that I couldn't spare at this point. My $16 deal now cost $51. Cancelling Uber at this point would mean a missed flight, lost connections and expensive misery. There was nothing to do but pay whatever they asked. Sort of like breaking down in the middle of nowhere with the only mechanic being the crooked Sheriff's brother. Well played Uber! Well played! I can't help but think this is a frequently used well-planned scenario or else they would have made me aware of this surge thing the night before being a possibility. Had they done so, I would have used a stable priced cab service. I shall never use Uber again. They not only screwed me, but all the transportation providers that were cheaper than $50.

I arrived at Manchester, UK airport around 10:30 pm and used the app to contact a driver. The app showed the driver was 3-5 minutes away but I waited 20 minutes before receiving a message that the ride was cancelled. Part of the problem was the waiting area was not clearly indicated and local police were not allowing cars to park so it wasn't easy to be met. However, I didn't receive a call and when I tried calling I didn't get an answer.  I didn't give up and tried twice more since by midnight there were fewer cars but it didn't help. On one of the ride requests I cancelled within 5 minutes. Now back at home I see that Uber charged me $5 US for each cancelled ride, even the one I legitimately cancelled.

I did this using the Uber app. Anyhow two days later I've received an email from Uber and I couldn't believe what they wrote to me.""Your account has been permanently suspended"". So they have suspended my account permanently for sending a complaint via their App. Can anybody believe this? Well after seeing what United Airlines did to one of it's customers nothing should shock us anymore! But all I want to say here is.. we all need to always look for and use alternatives. These big companies need to have as much competition as possible otherwise they will grow arrogant and start treating their customers like trash.",1,uber.com

Because I did not want to store a card number that was attached to my account or use a credit card that has thousands of dollars available to use I purchased a my vanilla visa debit card. I talked to my vanilla and ask them if this would be a card I could use with uber. They assured me of the cards available this card would be the one to use. I tried several times to set up the uber account using this card and they would not take it. Not only that but the customer service people totally suck at their job. Basically I was told to bad so sad - and at no time did anyone investigate if there was a reason why you can not use this type of card. they just said sometimes they just don't work use a credit card. This type of card is used by many to receive direct deposit of payroll instead of having a checking account. One would think that uber would do some investigation to find out why there is a problem. So if you want to try and protect yourself by using this type of card don't expect uber to try and help figure it out. Worst service I've ever received.

I had to get a cab which to the train from my place 20$ where the whole urber ride was 13$ then round trip ticket 16$ then another 16 more for cab from train to appt back to train.

First Uber does not have a lost item link of their website home page or App. They also demand full rude detail, drivers name, date of trip, cost of trip, time of trip and pickup and drop off locations.

The charge too much for a short distance it is almost safer and faster to get a cab simce they have a stupid map that does not show the driver where should he meet the person who requested tge ride.

198,"Uber for me is so buggy that I can simply not use it. I can not get my head around how a billion dollar company can not build a working app or website.  Bug (design flaw) 1: you need to request permission through support to use the mobile website as a rider. Bug 2: right now, the entire help.uber.com website is down. For hours. What?! Bug 3: once you've been granted ""permission"" to use the mobile web-interface for rides, there is no way to change your phone number. There's an ""edit"" button for the phone number on the non-mobile website, but this then tells you to go to the app (which you can't use, that's why you're using the mobile site, durrrr). Bug 4 (design flaw): once you've signed up with Uber there is no easy online way to delete your Uber account. I've looked into this and you actually need to contact support (the same support who's webpage is completely down right now) and write them an email saying you want your account deleted. Really?! In 2017?  They're a billion dollar company but their website and software is worse than that written by a startup full of 12 year olds in their moms basement. I feel sorry for any talented coders working under Uber's obviously out of control ""manage""ment.",1,uber.com

When I emailed the help line, I got an email back saying this: ""we understand that you had a question about requesting an exception to our requirement for a valid State driver's license. I'm afraid that we are currently unable to allow exceptions to this requirement. We know that Active Duty Service Members may relocate frequently. While many local regulations recognize this, these terms do not necessarily apply beyond personal driving."" There is nothing wrong with my license, I am not asking for an exemption. My license is valid.  On top of that I had to jump through hoops to get my account reset because when I drunkenly set it up the first time I put in the wrong email.

203,"This review is not just about the airport pick up, but in general for people who wish to know how to travel. The best and only taxi company that I would recommend is Blue Bird, they are great! They always use the meter and the drivers are professional The other taxi companies (dark blue, purple, grey colour taxis, not the light blue - blue bird taxis) are all rip offs! Be careful, they are scammers and rude 99% of the time. Ok now onto Uber, it can be great and it can be not so great, I would say 75% of the time it is good, but if you get one of these drivers look out - Booked a Uber ride at 6.09pm with driver ""I Dewa Made Satrya"" to pick up from Nikki Beach Club, after waiting at the front of the club for 10 mins it was clear he was not coming as his vehicle which was 1km away was not moving in our direction, but I was surprised when the app changed to being on the journey, a few minutes later it finished but I was charge 15,000 rah (of course you waste time and write to uber the they refund it, but why should loyal passengers need to go through such crap when it is clearly not their fault?) I then booked Uber again at 6.19pm, the same driver ""I Dewa Made Satrya"" accepted the booking but this time, he messages me on WhatsApp to tell me unless i pay cash he is not coming, so I try to change the payment method to cash but this is not allowed on the Uber app, so when I tell the driver this he says unless I pay him cash he will not come!! He then asked me to cancel, but luckily it is within the 5 min BS time limit so I am not charged a cancellation fee this time (even though again it is not my fault!) I advised the driver ""I Dewa Made Satrya"" that the service is terrible, he told me he does not care and when I said I would report this service to Uber he said ""I do not fear"", clearly Uber does not care for passenger service and is happy to hire anyone in Bali as a driver, as I would never employee someone with such an attitude, especially when now 18 hours later he just sent me another offence message to my phone ""You Emang Top"" Anyway avoid the driver ""I Dewa Made Satrya""with phone number +62 821 4407 1347 I then attempted to make another booking, this time it was picked up by driver ""Nyoman"", this booking was at now 6.29pm, this driver was 8 minutes away and started driving to my location, so I was thinking great finally have a driver, he was within about 3 minutes away and then I noticed he kept going passed the turn off and when I contacted him he said he is not coming, I could see on the app he was like 3 mins away, then 6 mins, 9 min, 12 min and clearly not coming to Nusa Dua but driving to Ulawatu, this driver just ignored all contact from me via message/phone, just keep driving and I guess waiting for me to cancel, which I finally did, clearly another driver that does not care for passenger service Please avoid ""Nyoman"" driver and his number is +62 812 3786 5029, he clearly does not care and should not be allowed to drive for Uber. Ok so finally made another booking with Uber, it is now 6.40pm, the guy turns up, very nice driver, but as I got into the car and sat down my daughter was just getting into the car and the driver starts to drive off, without her being in the car, the door was still open, my daughter then hit the road and was left on the street, this was clearly an accident but careless driving from Uber, I will not write his name, as he was nice, but clearly not careful. Anyway basically after about 4 bookings, waiting 40 minutes, writing to uber for refund for my 15,000 Rph, we made it home to the villa in seminyak. Honestly i love Uber, use it all over the world, however, I think in some cities like China (especially Beijing), Bali and Sydney the server now is terrible and the prices are on the increase so a taxi can be about the same!!!!

204,Why is it if they take money out of your account for the Uber rides that they have to take additional money which they say it's an authorization hold but they do not put it back for at least eight days and this is money that I cannot access and another thing if you have an Uber gift card they still want to put monies from the ride from your checking account on hold when it is confirmed that they will get paid by the Uber gift card. I have for three weeks been trying to resolve this problem on two separate situations and the customer service is horrible. Isn't it illegal for them to keep a hold on your money even after they get paid for the services of an Uber driver taking you to your destination. And why does it take so long for it to drop off from your checking account they should confirm you have the money then debit your account for the Uber ride and then that's it.

205,"My first experience with uber was absolutely horrible. A driver by the name of Wylder picked up myself and a friend and we were under the impression this was a safe, comfortable and convenient way to get to our location. It was not. The car (ford focus) was in horrible shape, the seats were tore up and covered in nasty stains. The vehicle smelled like cigarette smoke so bad I could hardly breath, and the driver was very unprofessional. He didn't use GPS and asked if we minded if he picked up a 3rd passenger on our way, we accepted since there was room, but then Wylder drove around for 30+ min looking for this other potential ""client"". He finally drove back to the location that he picked us up at and said ""I am suppose to be looking for a girl named Brittany""... umm, That would be me! He didn't seem to know what he was doing one bit. I felt very unsafe with his driving ability as he was all over the road and made sharp sudden turns in the wrong direction on several occasions.

222,"We called an Uber to head to the San Jose airport as we often do. Our first driver showed up and asked us where we were going and we said San Jose airport. Immediately he said he is ""going to have to pass"" since he wants to get home soon. He didn't want to take us that far. I find this appalling - the airport is a 18 miles, 20 minute ride away. If he didn't want to accept passengers then why did he accept our ride? We wasted 8 minutes Waiting for him for nothing.  We then called another Uber and she came after 5 minutes. She also asked us where we were going and when we told her the airport she said she had to pass because she didn't have proper authorization to make trips to the airport. Needless to say we were pretty pissed at this point but decided third time's a charm.  The third driver was 5 minutes away. We called him right then and there and specifically asked him if the airport as a destination was going to be a problem. He said ""I think it's ok"". Then a couple minutes later we got a cancellation notice. That is THREE DRIVERS in a row that refused to give us a ride based on our destination. It's not like we were asking to go 100 miles away. SJC is the closest airport to the Fremont area and there was no traffic at this time of day.  We ended up using Lyft and even with a 75% prime time charge, we knew we would get reliable service and a driver that was courteous and would take is to where we needed to go. And that is exactly what happened. Our Lyft got us there swiftly and with no issues or complaining about the destination. Uber, you have LOST this customer. I find this appalling and completely unprofessional. One cancellation I can maybe understand and brush off as a specific driver issue. 3 in a row means there is something systemic going on and that your customer service model is broken.

230,I have recently been using uber in Panama central America it has turned into a nightmare experience not only with drivers but also with Uber Support personal. one driver charged me 10 dollars for a fare that has been costing me only 3dollars I made a complaint and instead of supporting me they blocked me from something the driver said about me. He was not the person on the profile also and obviously just a friend of the taxi Uber Driver. I found the app malfunctioned so many times that it caused distress to me. The drivers were so rude that they never answered calls or texts. One taxi driver went to wrong place and did not respond to me I waited for an hour for an arrival but he never turned up. The Uber Support personal are also rude and don't listen to your complaint properly I was actually blocked from using uber because of a driver telling lies about me. I have never been treated so awfully by a taxi service in my entire life.,1,uber.com
231,I have been charged multiple times now for rides I have not taken. And every time I try to resolve the issue I'm never able to get a hold of anybody and nobody contacts me back. It is more of a scam then a service,1,uber.com

233,I use UBER frequently but this last time I was accused by a White driver that her property was stolen from her car. UBER contacted me to tell me my account had been canceled. I tried to contact UBER but they never replied back.,1,uber.com
234,"Uber ripped me off! Applied ""surge charge"" of 2.2x the fare but there was no prior notification of this in the app. I was not informed and did not grant permission for this. The app only showed a fare estimate of Â£7-9. I got home to find that a taxi journey that ALWAYS costs me around Â£7-9 had cost Â£22.50, already charged to my card and I had no means of recourse in the app. I had to go onto their website to file a ""report a serious issue with you driver"" case to get to a human and they didn't read anything of what I had written - just robotic copy and paste answers! I threatened to take it further and finally got the surge charge refunded but they said it would be a one-time gesture only, so this could happen again and I'd simply be screwed. They made out that they were doing me a massive favour and I was just lying about not being notified of the surge fare. The next day (today), bizarrely I got an email through: ""Hi xxxx, To ensure your security, we have reset your password. To log into Uber, you will need to choose a new password."" Then when I try to reset this I get the following: ""SOMETHING WENT WRONG. There has been an error, and we are currently looking into it."" However others can log into their accounts using this same computer/same IP. I then checked the app and it was not accessible to me either, so they have killed my account it seems because I demanded my money back. It's fine by me because there wasn't going to be a next time anyway, but what a crooked, horrible company! Avoid!",1,uber.com

237,"Really Disgusting! This is the condition of National Capital Region, the biggest frustration people facing here is conveyance and moreover traffic. Nobody is hell bothered about 9-10 hours of jobs extending to 12, 13, 14, 15 hours and so on. A person going to office or market thinks to book Uber/ Ola, the first question the driver asks is DROP KAHA KA HAI- i.e. Where is your drop location. Whereas, its clearly mentioned in Ubers rule book that the driver is not suppose to ask the drop location, not a big deal the rules are as fake as the company is. After waiting for 10-15 minutes, either the driver switches his mobile off, or standing at one position he will say that I am not able to track your location or even he will just sit over it and cancel the trip after 15 min with no intimation. This is not something that happens once or twice a week, this is something that happens twice/ thrice a day. Then for all the cancelled trips they will deduct 80/- (per trip), now if a person doesnt have the time to write them the incidence happened, they will not even return the money back. Even after my last complain to uber, I attached the screenshots and sent them, these people apologized and gave me vouchers to close the matter and said that this will not happen again. But what next, everytime I should write them such detailed mail so that they pay attention to this, they dont even have a customer care. Moreover the driver has the guts to say that JAO KAR DO COMPLAIN or Okay, Jisse kehna hai kaho. Because what worst, just that they will not get the days incentives, nothing more then that. Everybody is just into money printing business, and who is the sufferer, just the common man. Frustrated person, at last when goes to an auto wala so either he will be on strike or he asks for money as per his choice, because there are no rules. Nobody is there to check. Why is the common man working so much, just to get frustrated and depressed, for he is helpless for so many things and at last he should be happy that he has money to get admitted in a branded hospital. Anybody in India can strike for any non sense thing demanded, what should a common man do. Leave all his work and strike for the thousand things that he has to face because of wrong people into business. What is the government doing. Meru and mango are out of business because of uber and ola. If this will be the case, the day is not far off that even uber and ola will be out of business.",1,uber.com

I have never run into what happened to me this morning with a ride charge of $68.97 US in New York. When I requested a ride I was told the fair was approx $18 from my hotel to LGA Airport. A surcharge screen then came up which advised me a 2.3 surcharge would apply to this rate. I didn't understand it and read it as an additional 2.3%. Now I am advised that it means actually an additional 2.3 rate. Even at that 2.3 rate $18x2.3=$41 not $68.97. When I received the uber receipt after the fact I was charged $68.97. I would have never agreed to this. A normal cab ride was $40. I feel violated and cheated by Uber. This system is not set up right and is very confusing for the customer.

Second, anytime you write them for any reason, you receive a canned response that shows your original email was neither read nor comprehended by a human. Then they won't adjust fares when you've been shorted until you've sent at least five or six emails.  Finally, they'll relent, usually. You'll get multiple responses that are canned and look like dialogue from Valley Of The Dolls.  The people who get in your car are sometimes smelly and your car will smell the next day. Also, UBER is a terrible corporate citizen. .85 cents a mile/.75 cents for UBER Pool plus .13 per minute means that when you deduct .575 cents a mile while riders are in the car and .575 cents per mile to get to the rider, you'll LOSE MONEY ON EACH AND EVER RIDE! This means a full time UBER Driver will never pay a dime in taxes, qualify for Social Security or have any money in life. All full time UBER drivers will end up a burden to the government while their cars have been polluting the environment.

Gave me a low score saying a rider said my vehicle didn't meet their standard of cleanliness, this was not true because I am constantly cleaning my vehicle and passengers are always ccomplementing me on. How fresh my vehicles smells, after passengers are in and out of your vehicle you will realistically have some sand in the floor, there is no way to logically and safely vacuum your car out between the hours of 10pm and 4am that's makes no sense which is what they tried to suggest to clean the car after each fare. How?? If u get trips back to back when do you clean of course if someone vomits you're going to clean that mess up... But to top it off when they said the car wasn't clean they took the opportunity to throw in There saying remember your PERSONAL HYGIENE as well, which was not even the comment.. I was personally offended and have not driven sense.. I am a clean person and just because my car was not emuculate enough for one rider shouldn't have turned into the opportunity to insult me... I know it was an automated response, but those two responses need to be separated from each other because they are two separate issues...",1,uber.com

I wait for 15 mins she did not cancel the trip. until she cancel the trip I can not able to request for another driver.. because she accepted that she can not able to pickup me, then the right thing is she must cancel the trip.. but not even its happened in this case.. so she has done these many mistakes1) she don't have idea of area where she is going to pick up 2) though I'm giving her clear directions she did not found me 3) she accepted that she can not able to pick up me after my almost half an hour request.. but still she did not cancel the trip.. 4) because of her unprofessional behavior she charged me cancellation fee.. she wasted my precious time.. my request to the management is don't give permission to the such kind of unprofessional and unexperinced drivers to drive the uber.. because customers finally get bad openion and worest experiences with the UBER",1,uber.com

I got dropped off by the first guy, before I could even put my seatbelt on (all of a sudden had to take his wife to work) So I call another Uber (gives me a 2.5 times rate.... with no information on what the heck the rate is, NO OTHER OPTION - that or no UBER, and every time you search another one.. the rate gets higher and higher....)

286,I'm in New York and trying to catch a cab to the airport. It is pouring down rain and the taxis are busy. I decided that I would try UBER. The app kept timing out on my iPhone then it came up and said UBER Pool. I'm thinking OK I will share a ride and save some money. LaGuardia is only 7.5 miles away and it usually about $35 for a cab fare. It took about 15 minutes but I was willing to wait to I didn't miss my flight  I had a very nice driver and a nice car but he couldn't tell me how much. I was the only passenger so I thought OK I got lucky and no one else is going to the airport since it said UBER Pool. I had no other choices anyway. I have a computer training business so I am very savvy with technology. I arrived at the airport and he said it would compute the fee but he couldn't tell me how much because the app had also put in JFK and not LaGuardia which is not what I chose. Maybe another potential customer not sure. I got the receipt and was charge $179 for the short trip. When I contacted UBER they said since it was busy they could charge me 3.6 times the normal fair. That is really taking advantage of your customers. I don't think my customers would be happy if I told them since they scheduled their training on a very busy day that my rate would be 3 or 4 times more than normal. This is price gouging. I will NEVER EVER use UBER again.,1,uber.com

On the second night out: After receiving a ride downtown on the hotel shuttle, we had dinner and went out exploring the nightlife. Then we order Uber and the app said they were 10 minutes away, no problem. As we followed the drivers progress at about 5 minute out, he called to confirm our location and said hed be there shortly. A few minutes later his location was off and we did not see him on the app. We called back his number and he said he is going to take another fare and we need to find a different ride.

297,"It's been 2 years that we are using uber, but the kind of issues we have faced in past 2 months have totally washed away the past 2 years of good experience. I'll explain the major episodes- 1. Maruti Ritz- Me and my husband were travelling from sector 57 gurgaon and sec 14 gurgaon, my husband had to get down at huda city which was midway. There are 3 ways for this route, when we asked him to take the huda route he said i can't do this otherwise I'll be in loss, I'll move according to the navigation. We told him that this concept is for car pool, but he continuously kept on saying that you don't know, i am the employee i know. He continuously kept on howling ""mai apki wajah se apna nuksan thode na karaunga"". After damn frustration we asked him to call the customer care and ask, even after knowing the fact, what he again misbehaved and said that ""hum aisa isliye karte hain taki ap baad me ye na kaho k galat raste pe le gye navigation k hisab se"". He was not silent for a min till 3/4th the way. This is highly unacceptable. 2. We both had to travel from gurgaon to delhi, it was sunday eve not too much traffic also. We booked uber thrice. The first driver 6:08 pm when we called him after 5 min he said that he cant go to delhi.. in car pool its not possible. Second driver 6:14 pm, we called him within 2 min, he also asked where u hv to go, i disconnected the phn. He again called to ask the destination, i didn't tell. He said ok, he was jst 5 min away, we kept on waiting for 10 min, no response,.when we called to check, he switched off his phn. Then also we waited and kept on calling for 15 min then finally he cancelled the trip. Third driver 6:39 pm- he too was just 5 min away , for half an hour he kept on saying that i m searching whereas he was not. At last we asked him to reach rail vihar the nearest landmark, its clearly seen in the map, finally he replied "" madam mujhe search karna nahi ata"". Then i shouted and said that i am going to make a complain, he was at rail vihar within a min, bt we had already cancelled the trip. We were late by 1 and a half hour, moreover we were damn frustrated. Finally then i booked uber from my phn and we got the cab. 3. Today in the morning, i made a request for own car from sec 57 to 14 gurgaon. A driver mahinder, hundai accent accepted the request and said that its in pool and he is going to dwarka delhi. The rider he was having was also saying that i didn't opted for pool. He asked me to cancel, so i did. I was booking it for office, in hurry. I again sent a request and again he only accepted and when i called him, he replied i have to take this request otherwise ""meri ye trip waste ho jayegi"" i don't know how. I said i havent opted for car pool, I'll be late for office how does it matters to me k apki trip waste ho jayegi. So what he replied was, he actually shouted that ""to mujhe kya farq padta hai k apko late ho raha hai"". I have actually referred uber to many of my knowns, i now feel like writing these reviews everywhere. This is just not acceptable. These are only the major issues that i hv mentioned, and it actually doesn't matter if u cut their day's incentive when we are facing so many issues with so many drivers. They take advantage of your 6 trip incentive method and it will deteriorate uber's image, u should make it km based incentive method Uber is working only becoz of customers.

304,"Recently, the Uber rates were lowered to a rate that significantly beats the rate to the standard yellow taxis in the city (NYC). Yet Uber finds a way to always scam the customer with ridiculous markups for ""busy"" times, or ""in demand"" areas, etc. Mind you, we're not talking about a measly 50 cent or so surcharge, they actually double the estimate rate on many occasions. One day without paying attention you might end up having to pay $80 for what you've taken at a rate $40 on several occasions only because there were quite a few people requesting other drivers in that area at once. Seriously??  The support is a complete joke. At least when I call a CC or my bank support, although I'm getting someone from Thailand or Singapore, someone actually picks up the phone. Uber doesn't even have a number! This is a company valued in the billions. Again...Seriously?? After you send the email for a charge dispute, they are very polite in telling you ""NO, our calculations are correct at present rider rates."" -Um NO, they're not if the more expensive rate setting alternative is cheaper. Folks, don't fall for the ""trend"" of using Uber because many others are. Trend setters will wait on line for 3hrs to get a muffin because so and so celebrity gets their pastries there. Yea I know...really stupid. So don't be one of those. Plenty of alternative car services in this big city that'll actually pick you up with a SET rate to give you before they even come.

They gave us zero peace of mind with their security systems with credit card information, basically we got the sense that there is NO security and they have NO sense of urgency when it comes to fraudulent credit card use.

308,"Uber, a company valued at 61 billion dollars. Uber is very popular with their riders. The reason uber is so loved by their riders is because a uber ride is about 1/3rd the price of a taxi. A uber rider can pay a minimum of $4.80 for a ride. A taxi would charge around $10.00 for the same ride.. A uber driver will average 10 minutes to go pick up a rider and take the rider to their destination and drop them off. Uber driver ends the trip and uber instantly displays how much the driver is paid, $2.40 for the trip. The trip will take around 30 minutes of your time. Now the driver has to pay for their gas, insurance, wear and tear on their vehicle. After the driver figures in the expenses, he or she is left with a profit of zero!! I have drove for uber part time for 2 years plus. In the beginning I easily made $350.00 a week. Now I average $75.00 a week and drive twice the miles to make that. Uber has not sent my 2015 1099's to report the income to the IRS. When you email uber about a problem, you will receive a robot answer. Uber does not care about their drivers. Uber only cares about increasing their $61 billion dollar value to $81 billion. I am a retired man and my advice to anyone who is considering driving for uber is......DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!! You will be better off flipping burgers at McDonalds.",1,uber.com
309,"UberPOOL is a total scam and as a matter of fact, I think the algorithm is totally off in many cases. UberPOOL would charge me more than a UberX for exactly the same route during the same time of a week and the only difference is POOL wasted me twice the time for picking up the second passenger from THE AIRPORT, where we had to drive in and wait and pick up the other passenger from one of the terminals. I tried contacting customer service FIVE TIMES because it made no sense to me at all and I doubt whether any of the customer support people had any sense how the product actually works or even how to read at all, because none of them ever answered my question and instead just said very random and useless things to me. Dear Uber, please at least spend some money training your people because they made your company look very stupid and unprofessional.

310,I was with family coming back home after shopping. We called uber the first time ever. The driver probably was drunk. He took totally a wrong route and when we said it's wrong he said he has to follow the directions which were shown on his uber device. He just kept driving and suddenly we found our selves on highway. I got worried and ask him to call some one he said he can't do that. He was driving so rough and just kept going on the highway. We asked him to just stop and let us go but he said he can't coz he won't get paid then. At last we have to tell him that if he doesn't stop we will call 911. He just suddenly applied the breaks and we escaped the accident by mere inches. Finally he let us got off whrn we said we will pay him in cash and we realized we were in some different city. We took a taxi and came home. Uber charged us the extra fare and the trip cost us 130 $ what would have been just 12-15$. The worst and scariest experience of my life.

We saw the car pass the location once and I said, ""We're in trouble already."" The driver came around the block. Pulled up. We had a lot of bags. He didn't lift a finger to help. After loading the trunk I got in the rear passenger side door. While sitting there waiting for my partner to get in the other door I saw him put the car into Drive. I almost said something thinking to myself this guy wouldn't start going before everyone was in the car. WRONG. HE STARTED ROLLING. LUCKILY MY PARTNER, WHO COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED, WAS NOT. He stopped the car. I said, 'We're out of here.' Once again, surprise, surprise he didn't help us take anything out. UBER IS DANGEROUS. THEIR DRIVERS ARE NOT PROFESSIONAL.

326,"When I started driving UBER, on the surface it looked good. It became very obvious, very faster than obvious, what UBER is really about, NOT: ""Delivering Quality Rides""! UBER is to deliver cheap, fast transportation, on the costs of its drivers, by allowing every dumb*** to rate the professionalism of Drivers. And what is that? Putting up with a rider's: - dumb comments - insults - arrogance - unfair demands - demand to break traffic rules - impatience and then still feed the rider with free sweets, drinks and accept to receive a low rating because you didn't look like the rider would have wished you look like, etc., Very professional, UBER.

331,"My wallet was stolen out of an uber last night with my social security card inside and this was the message I sent over 4 hours ago and have yet to recieve a response. I seriously question the legitimacy of this company and strongly advise people not to use the app. I have been a big fan for almost two years but I truly believe there is an underlying issue with this company. Any other customer support system would be much more attentive to the matter and have consideration to help their customers with their best interest in mind.  To Uber customer support: I received an unusual phone call from your company this afternoon that made me so uncomfortable that I had to hang up. The man on the phone had a hard time speaking clear English and said that he had contacted the driver but failed to Answer any questions pertaining to the wallet, even when asked directly. The phone call seemed like it was coming from over seas. Unless it was a mock phone call, it has made me begin to question the legitimacy of your company. I have spoken with a lawyer, the police, an investigator, and the attorney general's office. Further action on this matter will be addressed within the next few days because your customer service has failed to make the slightest advancement in helping me. I have been in contact with you for the past 8 hours and have yet to receive the smallest details about my driver, such as his last name, despite the fact that your employee has committed a felony against one of your customers. I am extremely disappointed and will continue to inform everyone I know of this situation and the how unprofessionally it has been handled.",1,uber.com

335,"If you are contemplating driving for Uber in NJ, think again....maybe 3x. Ask around. All I know from my experience as a driver for three months with 500 trips under my belt and a 4.8 rating........be very very circumspect before leasing a car. What they do is rope you in as a driver with decent pay for two weeks....then wham.....they cut the fares in half. Let me ask you as a logical human being......can a driver who has usually a car payment of at least $600 per month...plus insurance.....(unless the ins. co finds out you drive for Uber and then presto....drops you like a rusty safe in the river) plus gas, and wear and tear on the car driver 10-15 minutes for $3....well that is the fare they pay. Also if you happen to drive to Manhattan......and they take out $20 for toll and charge the customer.....and then only pay you $8-15 on top of that to drop off the customer before you have to drive through traffic to get back into NJ to accept another fare which usually takes at least an hour....do you think that is a good usage of time and good pay? You see what Uber is doing is trying to show Wall Street (Watch ""The Big Short""- very appropo for Uber) the huge rider base. The problem is that the drivers are dropping out like flies because they can not afford to drive. I know as I have picked up many ex drivers recounting the same experience. Wall St......which incidentally I used to work for years ago for almost two decades.....is about to have a rude awakening when they see the market valuation Uber claims of $63 bill. -even though they lost over $467 mill in 2015-from a confidential source yours truly picked up devulged-is nothing more than specious and a ""house of cards"". Now Uber's PR will tell you how wonderful it is to slash fares all in order to be more busy for the drivers but don't believe a word they say. It is because they are burning through drivers faster than the INDIE speedway all in order to keep riders happy. Good luck people in your decision but know that you had better do your homework before you get involved in such an exploitive outfit. BE DAMN CAREFUL.",1,uber.com

353,These uber drivers have no experience and who knows if the driver is on drugs or selling drugs in his car. Government is actually making it easier for public to easily access drugs.  Taxi drivers are more reliable because they go through proper training! Taxi drivers have commercial insurance and their cars are inspected by county officers whereas uber doesn't even have enough customer service representatives.  What would government do if one of these uber drivers rape or kill somebody or kidnap one of their clients for ransom and who knows if it's the same driver and these drivers don't even have to go through any kind of training.  This uber put lot of taxi drivers out of work! i don't think it's fair because this uber service is just extra money for some greedy people.

It's not just infuriating, it is beyond unsafe to have these untrained, unregulated, unruly drivers be allowed to engage in such a profession and endanger the lives of others.

Then he cancelled the ride without my consent, and had the nerve to charge me a $10 fee! Why should I pay for no service, especially the driver was the one who cancelled, not me! He was a no-show and I ended up walking few blocks to catch a cab and late for a meeting, after wasted close to half an hour waiting! The worse thing is, there isn't a customer service number to call. I emailed Uber support and they took a while to respond. I was offer a ride credit but I demanded a refund, as I had no intention to use them again. I filed disputes with both PayPal and my credit card, then all of a sudden Uber freezed my account. They have multiple agents contacting me and asked for photo ID and credit card copy...why would I do that? It's fraud waiting to happen, and can't be legal!

393,"I need to warn all of you Uber drivers about Ubers $1,000 00 deductible through their insurance coverage. I was on my way to pick up a passenger when I was hit by another vehicle. Right away, I reported it to Uber in the San Francisco office. A staff member insisted I contact my insurance company and report it to them. I insisted this was not appropriate since I was on my way to a pick-up a Uber rider. After much-to-do, I finally contacted my insurance company and they informed me I have no coverage at the time since I was picking up a Uber passenger. Afterwards, I went back to the Uber office at which time the Uber rep. informed me that I had a $1,000.00 deductible through Uber's insurance. The upshot is that I was lucky the other ddriver had insurance. Since it was urgent I get back on the road and I knew Uber's staff would not get me back on the road for several weeks, I decided to take the issue in hand myself and contacted the other driver's insurance company to get the repairs done.  I hope Uber drivers are able to unionize in the Bay Area. With a union backing Uber drivers, we won't be denied customer tips, and employee support for such things as insurance coverage with no deductible while on Uber time, better wages for the wear and tear on our cars, mileage reimbursment for travel time back to the original customer pick-up if we can't get a fare back to the original pick up or within 6 miles of origiinal pick up.

When she cancelled her original request they charged her a $5 fee & when she put in another request while sitting in my car it gave her a different driver so she had to keep cancelling those drivers while being charged a cancellation fee until the uber app gave her my car as the right driver.

My only regret is that I cannot do more than register my BBB complaint, plaster my situation on social media, and stop using their service. What they are doing is illegal. Yes, it was only $5. But, they do not have a right to take $5 out of my pocket while not delivering any service to me. Again, THEIR DRIVER CANCELLED! Is this a new business model for them? Have their drivers cancel and charge the customers money so they make money without having to spend any time delivering the service? Incredible.

399,"I've been driving for Uber in the Midwest for eight months. My average hourly income after gas is about $7/hr. On short trips, Uber takes about 50 percent of the fare. In my city, that means I pocket $2.35 a ride. The fifty percent comes from $1.80 Safe Ride charge and then 20% of what remains. You can expect 2-3 trips an hour. Longer trips are more profitable percentage wise, but not much. During surge pricing 3X and up you can do ok, but surge times are limited and you can only expect a few surge rides a night. Last night was very average for me. Six hours, 100 miles, $40. Two surge rides, but only 1.8X. I'm sure some of the larger markets are better, longer average trips, more surge, etc, but not really worth the time in a city smaller than Dallas, Houston, etc. The Uber concept is great for riders, drivers and mostly Uber. I really enjoy driving for them. I put this out there so any prospective driver knows what to expect.

My Uber Driver exited off the fwy on one of the busiest streets, during the busiest times on a Friday... I requested to be dropped off, not inside the Forum Parking Lot but in the street since I only had 10 minutes to walk across the parking lot, go through security, and find my seats...

So I had a few problems and some customers are not fair weather they are having a bad day or not feeling well or just disgusted with life itself. Uber should really try to communicate with there partners and see if they can help a driver and hear what they say about the passenger. I own a 2001 2 door Acura and I had to purchase a newer vehicle to drive and so the passengers were comfortable my way of providing good service. I did my best and that was not good enough because of how customers rated us and there comments. The sad part was that I rated almost everybody with a 5 star ratting.

There were also ample drivers available He raised his surge until someone accepted. There was no disclosures or an idea that he was charging $250. It is not clear what surge charge is  It only states 5.9x. 5.9x of what.  When you take a ride twelve hours earlier for $30 no one would expect to pay $250 for the same ride.

Surge charging to 2 or 3+ times the normal rate, app crashes, poor drivers, and above all, weak and unhelpful customer service. Now any d bag with a license can be a driver. Some of the drivers even pedal coke and weed thru Uber. Other drivers hit on girls and try to get dates. We had a driver pick us up in his pajamas once. Another driver had a tire blow out and told us there was nothing he could do about it and we basically paid double for the trip since we had to order another uber. This is no longer a company that is in control. Uber use to be great. They use to be the Nordstrom of transportation. Now, you might get the first car you click, or maybe the app will crash. Maybe the driver will wait 10 minutes then call you and cancel the ride because he's stuck in traffic. Once you get the car, cross your fingers for a cool knowledgeable driver but 9 times outta 10 the driver is out of their area and they have no idea where they are. So use gps, but it doesn't help when gps takes you the ""shortest"" and most traffic ridden route. After your trip, hopefully you get charged the correct amount... Or maybe the driver will contact uber and say your trip was longer than it actually was and they will charge you more, which I hear is happening more often now. At least taxi drivers have to work out your transaction on the spot and you know you won't be charged more at a later time. Taxi drivers are also usually driving as a career, supporting their family, barely scraping by.

510,"I booked a ride from Radisson blu Tonk road to Nahargarh fort in Jaipur in India. While booking the ride, both pick up and drop points were specified. Even when we hopped in the cab, we told the driver specifically that we need a drop to nahargarh fort. However, when we reached amber road just at the bottom point to Nahargarg and jaigarh fort (both on same way) the driver stopped and said this is the last point. He refused to drop us to the fort (any nearby fort). He asked us to get down at a point where there was absolutely no other transport service. It was scorching hot and disturbing. He did not move from that place. He said officially, this is the last point and we are not permitted to go beyond this point. A local auto fellow came and said he can give us a ride. We kept requesting the driver to drop us till the fort but he said we are not allowed to go beyond this point. He said beyond this point he can take personally and asked us to pay him Rs. 300 just to drop us till the nahargarh fort gate. We repeatedly told him to drop us to the fort gate but he refused and said either we should get down here (point which was 9kms before the fort gate) or pay him 300 and go. He also asked us to decide fast as the waiting meter is running and we are being charged for it. We were left with no choice but to get down in the middle of no where. We also did it because of anger and disappointment. Luckily, we found the auto guy whom we anyways had to pay Rs.500. We felt cheated and harassed. This is absolutely wrong work ethics and I am extremely disappointed with uber service because of today's experience.  I would also like to bring to your notice that the invoice that I have been sent, I have been charged Rs.200 entry fee for amber fort which I never went to. It seems the uber app is still not able to track and locate its vehicles pick and drop locations.

Little did I know that one of their drivers would scam me and Uber condones this behavior. My friend she lives in North Miami and we were going to South Beach. I ordered an Uber (Uber X showed up) for pick-up at approximately 9pm. North Miami to South Beach was $18.39. No problem with this fare.Got out of the Infinity SUV and we were on our way.Fast forward to two days later when I receive an email from Uber saying they made a fare adjustment. An adjustment in the amount of $175 for a cleaning fee. The driver filed an incident report with photos included stating I vomited in his vehicle. Photos that have no time or date stamps. There was no incident, his report is false. I have a witness who will attest that no incident occurred. I'm still disputing the charge in the amount of $175.

556,"Firstly there is the service. One day you might get a ride with someone who speaks the same language as you and is driving a clean vehicle that isn't dented, rusting or doesn't stink like the 9th circle of hell inside but that will be a RARE day if you ever do. Secondly, If you find yourself outside of their preferred pick up areas, you are not going to get a ride or you will wait longer than you wold have for a taxi or legal rideshare. Third, THERE IS NO INSURANCE. Uber is falsely advertising that they actually have insurance, their TOS page invalidates any and all coverage for you once you get in the vehicle. Fourth, their surge pricing scam is obviously NOT about a lack of supply or demand or they wouldn't be dropping the surge price once a few of their drivers have picked up people at THREE times the normal rate in the same area. It is a method of keeping their vehicles in one area so Uber can collect more fees from their drivers.

564,"This is a follow up to my previous review. In Dallas Uber has further increased their cut of the total take while reducing the cost of a ride. Now Uber charges 80 cents per ride, a dollar and 70 cents for their fee per ride which they take off the top and 20 percent of what is left. Thus a minimum ride (a ride under 4 miles) will attract an Uber charge of $5. The driver gets a gross of 2 dollars and 60 cents while Uber takes 2 dollars and 40 cents. If you are unlucky enough to give a ride to an SMU student, the would order you to take them to a fast food place usually a mile or one and a half away. They make you go through the drive through. If it is whatasaburger be sure you will spend anywhere between five to ten minutes waiting in line with your car running. Afterwards they eat in the car, spill drinks, food, leave trash, and jump out of your car after you drive them back with out tipping. Guess how much is your gross? It is a wopping 2 dollars and 60 cents. I used to get so worked up about it, and I am not usually able to hide my feeling about it such that I usually get a 1 star rating from those students. Somebody would say if you hate it so much why not quit. I will tell you why. I joined Uber 2 years ago. At that time my second wife had just died of multiple sclerosis. I still had two teenagers and an 11 year old at home. I had to find something that would be flexible. At that time Uber was advertising $35 dollars an hour for Uber X. If you really do the math you will realise that even if it was true, it is not much. Because the amount was merely gross. And the hourly mentioned was driving hours after you have picked up a client. It does not include the time spent in your car running the engine and waiting for Uber call. Neither does it include distances driven to pick up passengers. If the client cancells after you get there then it does not count. So I decided that Uber black was the way to go. You make fewer rides and much more money. So I contacted Uber. Asked about car requirements. With their approval I took 48, 000 dollar loan to buy a car. When I tried to register it as Uber black I could not. I sent an email and h ot a reply encouraging me to register it as Uber X and then open another email and register it as Uber black. I tried to do that but it was all a lie. A year later somebody at Uber finally told me that they stopped registering Uber black in the same month that I was asking them if it was okay to buy my car to use as Uber black. To cut the long story short I had to run the car as Uber black. Later Uber came up with Uber Select and they let me register and for a while it was better. Uber sellect cost about twice the cost of Uber X. I switched to only Uber Select. Pretty soon Uber ordered all Uber Select to also do X or be turned off. Then t hey systematically began to kill off Uber Select business by always surging the price of Uber select. The alternative is to flip burgers, but it will not pay for my 900 dollar a month car loan. So I am forced to spend a gazillion hours (at least twelve) to be able to earn anything between 100 and 200 dollars gross per day. Thete that is why am still doing it until I find an alternative. What irks me most is the fact that everbody blames the drivers. The press make Uber drivers the villain. They do not know the city, they are not curteous, they are dishonest, etc. But who advocates for them? Who sincerely wonders how they make ends meet? What about the American tradition of tips? Why should it not apply to Uber drivers? Some will say why do they do it if it is so bad? I have told you my reason. But now let us look at it broadly. Maslow's hierarchy of needs? It suggests that a human has 5 needs that must be satisfied in a hierarchical order begining from the lowest to the highest. In order to satisfy these needs humans do what they must. However when one lower need is satisfied the next in hierarchy becomes a need. A very hungry man will even for to work for food. That does not mean that he is willing to work gor food only. As soon as he is full he will want other things like clothes, shoes, housing, etc. A person pressed to a corner would work for Uber no matter how low his take. Uber knows that that is why there was a time they would pay up to 800 dollars to get you convince friend or family to work for Uber. Now they pay 300 dollars. So when you get some one not knowing the city do not just give him a bad rating. Be gracious. It is only a gracious person that will give dignity and not take it away. That poor guy is trying his best to follow his American dream not knowing that he/she is a mere hapless pawn in the hands of the great shark called uber who pleases and woes her customers by using her drivers as mere fodder. I have much more to say but am afraid this is becoming too long. However I cannot resist wondering what holds us together as a nation. Our military are known for leaving no one behind. Why would we close our eyes to the plight of fellow Americans? Not long ago Apple was being taken to task for making their phones in China and paying very low wages why do we let Uber mistreat so many our country men and we keep quiet? It is cheap yes but would you sell your family for cheap stuff? Are we truely a Nation or have we gone back to the land of France before revolution? Are we gone back to creating bourgeoisie and the peasants classes all in the name of cheapness and convenience? Thanks for reading. Okonkwo",1,uber.com

567,"I was an Uber driver in Raleigh,NC for 2 months a couple months after the launch just to check out what all the hype was about. First and foremost, driving for Uber is like working for about $10/hr(maybe) when you do the math. Uber charges riders in Raleigh $1.20 per mile. They pay their drivers 80percent of that or .96/mile. That is a mathmatical fact.As a driver,when you pick-up a passenger and drive them to their destination, you have to drive back to the hot pick-up area to get another fare.That's a fact. Raleigh is not New York City where you can pick up a rider,drive them across the city, and pick up another fare 5 blocks away. In Raleigh, you pick-up a rider, drive them 10 miles away,and then drive back the same 10 miles to get another fare(typically in downtown or local concerts etc). I did it and I know. I even camped out at the airport for 2 weeks from 7AM-10AM when 35 flights typically come in from big Uber markets. Very few calls to drive and I positioned myself so that I would be the first to be called because of an area I know about very close to the terminals. Back to the nasty math that Uber hates to talk about.Your .96/mile is now half that or .48/mile,because you have to drive back to pick-up another passenger. Gas in an efficient car is .15/per mile that you drive. Bro, now you are down to making .33/mile. Hardly what I call a good job part-time or otherwise considering you are wearing out your car driving people around. No BS what I have just told you here.Just the facts.1/16/2015 UPDATE!!!! Uber has now dropped their rider fees to .75/mile in Raleigh!! Amazing. Take everything I stated above regarding the money you can make at Uber as a driver and reduce it by over half now. They have added a bogus hourly guarantee(with conditions that are not within your ability to control)and have the gall to state that they are looking out for the drivers. Most drivers are actually losing money driving for Uber now,when they factor in gas and car expenses,nevermind making any money.People....You need to have your heads examined if you continue driving for Uber.

582,"It sure can be a great experience for riders, but not so for drivers. Uber advertises $18-35 an hour while driving for Uber, but it's not true at all. I drove for 6 hours last night and I made like $90, and I was busy. See, while one can get a lot of riders, many just want to hop a few blocks away, which is not worth it for the driver at all. The fare will be just about $3.20 or so, or $5.50? Taking into account that maybe I drove more than a few blocks to pick up that rider just to take him/her 5 blocks away? Minimum flat fee should be at least $6 to make it worth picking them up. I actually have a rider whose fee was $3.20. But the driver has no way to know in advance these things, otherwise I won't pick up that person. Let's do the math, last night I made 90 - %20 to uber = 72, now 72 - 17gas = 55. Now 55 - 10 a day for car lease = 45 Now $45/ 6 hours shift = $7.5 which is less than minimum wage. Sure there are nights or days when you get a bit more, but that still be around $12/hour, other days average pay might be $15/hour or so, but no where near $35 an hour. In addition, if my car goes over the mileage limit from the lease I will pay 15 cents a mile and driving for Uber my car WILL go over the limit.

584,"Uber has several problems that make it a poor experience for consumers IMHO based on my own experiences: 1) Their drivers are not well-trained or carefully selected. As a result, some drivers don't know where they are going and are just bad drivers who would never be hired by a taxi company (which in my book is pretty bad). So your trip could take twice as long as it should, which means if you're late it's very hard to depend on Uber.  2) It costs a lot. Some fares depending on how slow your driver is could be twice as much as normal cab. They also use ""surge pricing"" which can increase the price of your fare.  3) Uber customer service has a bad attitude. Sort of like ""you're wrong, this is why we're right"". I'm not saying their customer service is worse than cab companies, but I am saying my experience with Uber customer service was poor.  So in summation, Uber is a good idea, poorly executed.

HOWEVER, in Nov and Dec of 2017 my account was hacked and fraudulent rides were clocked in in LONDON and PARIS while I was in the USA. First time it was 4 rides; last time it was 9 rides and it all added up quickly. Two of my CC were used in the process, necessitating my CC Company to shut down one of my main credit cards... what a hassle to deal with all that. Customer Service (once you got it) was great as they did reverse charges (so the only folks out of the money I would assume would be the drivers, unless Uber picked up the Fraud Tab). But Uber did charge me a ''fee'' for reversing charges, so I did not walk away completely un-bruised. I promptly SHUT DOWN my account and will find another Ride-Share service that is more secure. Uber has got some issues to work out... their CULTURE as recent news reports allude to but also a BETTER way (faster and easier) to alert corporate about big problems with the app and web site and FRAUD, etc. The system as it is now is elusive and painstakingly complex. 4 Stars for the SERVICE & Riders; 1 Star for the Hacking = 2 stars total as my review/ranking.

590,"Recently use UBER to and from NY La Guardia Airport from my home in Riverdale, NY. The fare was $17.00 higher on the return trip than going to the airport. When I complained to UBEr, I was told that 'surge pricing"" applied to my return trip. Surge pricing is in effect during periods of high demand, high or heavy traffic,or bad weather. None of these conditions applied. In fact, we asked the driver upon pick up if it was particularly busy, and he confirmed clearly, it was not; in fact he said it was extremely LIGHT. There was absolutely no traffic on the trip from the airport to my home.  Conversely, on the trip TO the airport three days earlier, when my fare was $17.00 LOWER, the driver said traffic was extremely heavy and she took an alternate route to save time.  I firmly belive UBER also uses their ""SURGE PRICING"" as a means to increase revenue during normally quiet times, forcing customers to pay higher fares in order to make up for fewer rides requested. I find this very disturbing and unethical. Finally, in UBER's response to my complaint, I was told that the fare was displayed before I accepted the ride.

In my experience drivers refuse to contact their customers, they lack any ounce of hospitably, Ive seen cabs on my map literally pass right by me, are too lazy to find me or even make a U-turn. Despite the address I input some drivers will get lazy and drop me off at the wrong spot or a block away from my stop. Some drivers are either to old, lazy or stupid to know how GPS works, which cause locations errors most driver do not want to make up for, for a lot of errors drivers make I ""the customer"" have to compensate for. Uber's refund system is a joke! If a driver cancel a trip the cancel fee comes out of my pocket! And when I report it they give me credit (not an issue) but I want my real money they toke back! Their rating system is adorably useless, because regardless how many one stars a driver gets whats the point if you can't report the driver on their $#*!ty service or better, make a complaint, I've seen drivers that treat me like crap with five or four stars!?. I'm from NY and a lot of drivers are not American therefore theres a big broken English barrier, try explaining a location to someone who doesn't understand you or vice versa.

Example when your driver arrives and doesn't see you, they don't try to drive again to see if they find the passenger, they cancel and get $10 or $5 not fair at all. Okay so this Friday I went to an event in downtown and I decided to take uber home because I was tired thinking this would be a good idea. First driver passes by me I am waving and he cancels I get charged $10. I should of just taken the bus but I order a second one, he sees me right away and he drives. Well I wasn't drunk just super buzzed.. I notice this guy is taking a diffrent route like way off and he got off far from where my address was and was driving so slow but I don't say anything. Until the next day when I see my receipt not only did my heart stopped seeing how much I got charged 194 dollars plus the ten from the other driver, I was soo angry and the time on the receipt said 2:00 to 5:00 am so this guy didn't turn off his uber, he probably thought she's drunk she won't notice..well I was trying to fight for this because what this guy is a scam like I get it we all need money but too step this low to get money is not correct. Soo after a few messages with uber there only going to give me $100 back but I am still going getting charged $86 like wtf that's still too much and after being super angry and what that driver did I don't want too pay anything..I don't think I'll be using uber anymore shady money hungry people.",2,uber.com

After waiting for 12' to arrive, the first Uber driver that accepted my request came to 3 blocks of my building and cancelled. The second one also cancelled after a few minutes and so did a third one. Now I was out of time so I called a Taxi cab company and hired a regular cab. No more Uber to the Aiport at LAX for me. I read other postings and what happens seems to be that the driver do not make enough money and they also work for other services like Lift. They accept a fare and if before they pick you up a better fare appears on the other service, they cancel the pick up and there you are, back to square one.

617,"I have seen both sides to the Uber Coin and trained people in customer service. In this regard the Uber APP which if you accept as a driver or rider, are now a slave too and the APP is flawed for both parties, without any personal interaction, which is a major flaw in relation to Customer Service.  I can give you loads of stories of when the APP has failed for many different reasons and Uber taking no responsibility for a flawed APP especially on an android phone. You work your butt off under Uber to ends meet and Uber takes 20% of all fares before tax, so surging is required so they get more money not the driver.  As this is an arrangement between three different parties with no mediator, your ethic or values will determine if this will become so called great company based on customer service or not, the current situation for drivers and the demands put these private drivers under to have access to the APP are difficult, yet your response even with new drivers to the industry, will get a go or not, if you give them a low rating like 4 out of 5. Anything lower than a 4 from a client get ready for a meeting with Uber, so just remember if you are in a bad mood don't give driver a low rating for your mood swing they will loose their jobs. So all around Uber wins, and rider or driver being the foot fodder for Uber.

So, rather than make the rider wait I will begin the trip. But this means that the navigation system won't initiate to give directions. And, just as frequently, the app doesn't recognize that you have arrived at the destination so you can end the trip. Uber's answer is to employ a small army of workers to make adjustments to the ride beginning/ending and the associated fare after the fact. When I first started with Uber (only two months ago), the app worked well (80% of the time). Now, the above noted glitches occur 90% of the time.

Case #1: The driver charged me 100% more of the initial fare. He reported we were more than 4 riders. Not true. We were just my husband and I. After many claims from my part Uber eventually refunded me. Case #2: The driver reported that we changed the destination address. Not true. He charged 100% more of the initial fare. Uber never refunded me. Case #3: The driver charged me 100% more of the initial fare. She reported that I didn't provide the correct destination address. I explained to her that it must have been a system glitch. I was late for the appointment with my doctor because of that. She reported me to Uber as if I made racial discrimination remarks. NOT TRUE. I contacted Uber and demanded a meeting with the driver to clarify that offensive report. Uber never was able to sustain the driver's claim and eventually they opted to ignore my messages.

These two designations are poles apart. Ofcourse sharing is always time consuming. I do agree   But that should also be properly connected in the same route or beyond one destination or may extend to the bye lanes. Definitely that cannot be coupled with this type of two different directions , that too in this hyderabad traffic in the peak hours.

The Uber company is completely unethical towards it's drivers. When I started 2.5 months ago, I was all gung-ho but also paid very close attention to payment amounts from each ride trip - gas/mileage + hours worked - the 20% Uber cut. It only took one week to realize that I would have to really be aware of demographics, time of day or night, population density, where the out of control drinking was most concentrated, what areas attracted the most police, speed limits, pavement conditions, areas to avoid due to distance travelled just to pick up the rider...well you see where I am going with this. Efficiency had to be top of the list!  For two months I was able to just break a little above even IF I drove for 10 Hour shifts on Thursdays thru to Saturdays into the wee hours of Sunday.   Oh sure "" You can set your own hours"", not really folks because the brunt of your business will be on Friday, Saturday slowing to a trickle on Sundays after the brunch bunch is done drinking their Mimosas!   Last night I thought of a new slogan for Uber:  ""Don't drive drunk, ride drunk with Uber."" !!!  That is what you will be doing, is driving drunk people especially from about 11:30 on into the night.   I won't drive much past midnight anymore, due to vomiting dunk obnoxious binge drinkers. It is an ugly experience. Trust me on this. One male passenger had to be literally carried by his two buddies down a flight of stairs, he was out cold from extreme drinking. He was military and was in good physical condition but couldn't stay conscious. Yep that might of been a good time for me to refuse the ride. But noooo I stupidly let that crew into my SUV. :( fortunately no one threw up in my vehicle ... Almost though, it was close! Nice, real pleasant, NOT!  Are you getting the reality of what can happen if you drive too late Into the night? Your precious vehicle could very easily get vomited on, maybe even some will get on you as well!   When I started Uber had a promotion giving the riders an automatic 25% off their ride fee, corporate made up the difference to the driver. That made it feasible, if you were really efficient, it was possible to actually make a bit of profit. As of the beginning or August 2014, Uber changes the rider Deduction to 20% for the summer, BUT does not make up the difference to the driver. That means a total of a 40% reduction of rider payments for the driver. 20/80 initial split for driver/Uber, then another bit of 20%!!!! Now I made $4.00 to $6.00 dollars barely in the last 36 hours, Thurs, Fri and Saturday. That includes $140 in gas, not to mention mileage, oil change and DIY car washes. Windex and paper towels.  Under the present 40% deduction , 20% of which was arbitrarily forced upon the drivers and not covered by corporate, you might as well shoot yourself in the foot.

669,"I've been driving and riding with Uber for 3 months and I have completed about 500 trips. Overall, my experience has been very good. I don't like Uber's rating system...which allows angry, depressed, and drunk people an opportunity to rate you poorly. The pay is crappy. Net of expenses I might make minimum wage. My last trip was 3.2 miles, 10 minutes. I made 5.18. I have done 5 trips in Boise, been online 5.5 hrs. and made 23.48. (Tues) That's it. That's the downside. The upside is that I work when I want with no micro manager looking over me. 95% of the passengers are excellent, decent people. It's always the 5% that cause all of the problems. Vaping, sneaking drinks in the car, screaming and yelling. I had a kid call me a cracker. So there's always that. I read a lot of the reviews on this page. Some ring true, some I think are complete BS. The passengers I talk to (virtually all of them) love Uber. One guy told me he cannot afford to own a car- he simply Ubers everywhere and saves the expense. He uses Uber 40 times a month which costs him 200-250 or about half the cost of a car, insurance, gas, and oil.  There is nothing wrong with Uber. It's just another capitalistic, greedy corporation which is going to try and sweep every last crumb off the table.

673,"Many people like me will have spent big money to buy a late model car and work with Uber. People will have borrowed money from their credit cards or taken Personal loans or bought a car on finance to have a reasonable car to work with Uber. But in many cases with a single complain or bad rating they will put the driver off the system. some of these complains could be invalid/unfair or just that a rider is in bad mood. I have faced one such incident where I have avoided taking a right turn on a no right turn sign and the rider has made a big story about it and I have been taken offline without being given a chance of telling my side of the story.

674,"I drive for Uber in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I keep my car clean, inside and out, and often receive compliments on cleanliness. Uber drivers cannot be called from a time of more than 15 minutes from the pick up point, unless there is no other driver in the area. I have been called at 16 minutes without surge pricing. Speaking about pricing, in the Milwaukee area, the minimum charge is currently $5.25 (Uber X), of which the driver receives $3.20. The rate is based on $1.20/mile and $0.20/ minute (Uber X). Passengers often call Uber X when they should be calling an XL, but are rarely turned away. This does not give them a right to complain on that part. Customers are given estimates of the cost, as long as they put in the destination, and are notified if it is surging. They are allowed to cancel at any time, even after I arrive, without penalty. Fares can vary based on route taken, construction delays, accidents, and other traffic delays. I end the trip immediately, as per Uber policy, when I mess up on the route, get stuck in traffic, or if the customer gets upset because of the trip. The customer is my number one priority, and I treat every passenger the way I would want them to treat me. The large part of my ridership is intoxicated college students, and they often get rowdy in my car. It takes alot of patience, which gets trying, to keep professional. If this doesn't sound like a job for you, please, don't apply to drive. I agree that there are problems with Uber, most freqently is due to GPS location with dropped pins. I suggest to manually enter your location of pick up and drop off, and contact your driver as soon as you get a conformation and verify your location. I notify all my passengers, when I arrive, of the address I am at to confirm my location is where they want me. For passengers, if you are expecting an Uber to arrive, please be ready, look for a message, and respond promptly. Drivers are paid per completed trip, not per hour, and do not make money sitting and waiting. Which is why I only wait 5 minutes after I arrive, unless the customer contacts me, responds to my message, or asks me to wait. I often get into a surging area, for pick up, and have to wait for a customer who never shows or cancels after I have been waiting. This is upsetting because I could be out picking up an actual person who needs my service. Drivers do not know where your destination is until he starts the trip, so we cannot decline to take you anywhere until we have already started the trip, after which we are committed to following through because the app does not allow us to cancel a trip in progress. I have never turned away a customer based on destination, nor for them needing my trunk space. I have picked up customers from grocery stores and helped them with their groceries, even carried them inside for them. I have picked up people for the airport and loaded and unloaded their luggage, and wished them a safe trip! In Milwaukee, Uber does not have privileges to pick up at Mitchell International Airport, or at least Uber X's. I often make trips from the downtown area to Waukesha, New Berlin, Greenfield, Grafton, Oak Creek, and Pewaukee. These fares are typically between $13 to $26 on non-surge rates. Those trips are between 15 and 25 minutes one way. My take on these trips average out to about a dollar per mile and Uber takes the rest.",4,uber.com
675,Here are issues not all know the average pay for a driver who drives 600 miles a week is less then you think works out to be $400.00 a week after taxes insurance fuel net is $85.00 a week Break down the price for a trip of 4 miles safe ride fee $1.75 to uber provides nothing for the driver trip is $4.00-$1.75-20%= $2.40 to the driver so stop complaining and start hearing.

682,"Overall, I have enjoyed Uber as a passenger. Unfortunately though, I recently had a bad experience with a driver and the customer service was worse. I'm a loyal customer (having taken 28 trips for $900 in just 30 days) and was quite offended at how they handled this. Overall, I love Uber but I am sincerely disappointed about how they handled my complaint. On October 14, 2014, I requested Uber at 7 a.m. The driver FLEW past my house and I tried to call them twice to ask them to turn around and come back as they just parked at the end of the block. The driver didn't answer so I walked a block and a half to get my Uber. When I got into the car, I was overpowered by the scent of BO and/or some other offensive odor. I don't think the driver had it but the car was full of the smell. ugh, I walked a block and a half for this pleasure . . .  We then started our trip. By the time we hit the Steelyard curve on 176, she was chatting away at me (not bad in and of itself EXCEPT . . .) and looking at me while she spoke. I looked ahead at the line of brake lights ahead of us and shrieked! We came within INCHES of rear-ending the car ahead of us! YIKES! After that, she drove 50 mph on the highway for the duration of our smelly trip. I contacted uber that afternoon and the first guy said ""sorry about your experience"" and that was it . . . The second person said ""we'll talk to grace and I'll look into it"" but I heard nothing further. The third person said and this is a direct quote from her email: Sorry to hear that! We'll be sure to follow up with Grace to check in and share this concern. Again, thank you for taking the time to write in, I've added $10 credit to your account for the trouble. While it doesn't make up for the experience we hope this will allow you to have a better one in the future. Yeah, Amber - you're right, it doesn't make up for the experience. Bad enough you don't even have a loyalty/frequent rider program but after your credit, I still paid $25+ for that ride? They don't have a phone number either so you can't call anyone to complain.

696,"For myself Uber has been a pleasant surprise. After reading through a hundred plus reviews and watching a few YouTube related videos(hysterical). I found myself uncertain if I wanted to join the Uber Brigade. The reviews seemed for the most part, to be negative. Not enough pay, a lot of down time etc. For myself, Everytime I flip on the Uber app it's non stop, until I stop. However I live in Toronto and I only use it part time. I have a full time gig. If I work Uber its 2 to 4 hrs a night Monday to Thursday at ""rush hour"".Friday I go 5pm until 10pm and start back up at 2-2:30am and work for a few more hours. Saturday repeat and Sunday is always busy up until 4pm. The rate varies for me but I base it by the day. It's been as low as $18 an hour and as high as $35 an hr. I don't always work the best times but I'm still averaging $21 an hr. After my first month. If you work the right times you can make $25-35 an hour, for me a perfect effortless part time job. The people are great. I always offer water and candy. Anyway if you're reading this and contemplating just check it out what do you have to lose. Here's my reference number you'll receive a minimum $50 incentive after your first 10 rides. Or at least that's what my incentive was.

No one is stopping you to go else where but majority of you will run back to uber!  Uber shoud kick out rider with anything less than 4.00 stars because i have seen plenty of rubbish rates riders.

You will get to keep most of your money earned. I think the app works fine, would like to know where passenger is going before I take fare, but that's ok. I like the fact that I can drive when I want. I think most of these reviews are from taxi companies trying to take them out of business. No one ever is going to charge 300. for a 12 mile cab ride. You all are idiots. Uber is a great idea that I wish I would have thought of. Uber requires your car to be 2005 or newer. I'm sure there's a few Uber drivers that suck, but that is to be expected.

724,"Just started using Uber during a trip to Seattle this Summer. During that trip, had a chance to use Uber about a dozen different times. Then a half dozen trips in Portland, Oregon. Just got back from a trip to New York, where I used Uber extensively, as well as a few rides on a ""Yellow"" cab. In every case, Uber was extremely convenient. The vehicles were always on the new side, clean and comfortable. The drivers were prompt, helpful (provided us with walking directions, information on places to check out, and warnings about areas that were ""sketchy,"" etc). Because your ride is paid for automatically via the app, there is never any fumbling with cash, credit card reader systems, etc. Just get to your destination and go. The iPhone app is a breeze to set up and use. It allows you to chose the type and size of vehicle you need, lets you know how long you will have to wait for your ride, and gives real-time location updates on the Uber you have requested. It also gives you the name and customer ratings of your driver before you book the ride, notifies you as soon as your Uber arrives to pick you up, and allows you to contact your driver via cell if there are any issues. You are always asked to rate your last driver before you can book a new ride, which assures that Uber has extensive customer feedback, but can slow things down a bit if you are trying to book your next ride in a hurry. Our experience using ""Yellow"" cabs in many cities has not been great. By and large, have always experienced long wait times when booking a cab by phone. The standard seems to be ""your cab will be there in 15 to 45 minutes."" Usually, this works out to be 30 minutes plus. Have also had issues with cabbies not wanting to do business with me when my ride is only a couple of miles or less. In one case, had a cabbie whose car wouldn't start until AFTER we had gotten out of his car and jumped into another cab. The cabs always seem to be ""vintage"" - at least five years old - poorly maintained and on the gritty side. Our last experience with a cab ride was from La Guardia to New York's financial district. It was like the Long Beach Grand Prix meets destruction derby. Lots of jackrabbit starts, swerving in and out of traffic at high speed, slamming on brakes - all in a car that hadn't seen new shock absorbers in about a decade. My wife and I were both motion sick, but were too freaked out by our fast and furious driver to try fixing our eyes on the horizon. All-in-all, I am sold on Uber. Highly recommend it, and personally will never use a ""cab"" again unless I am forced to.",5,uber.com

727,"I have driven for UBER in Kansas City for over 1 year. I have also assisted with the regulatory process by testifying in Jefferson City State House and have participated in a number of Uber charitable/community events in KC. The greater Kansas City Missouri and Kansas metropolitan area people just LOVE riding with Uber and truly appreciate the higher level of service and safety that Uber delivers over the archaic taxi services. Uber is also a very good company that treats its drivers with great respect. The Uber app for Driver Partners is simply amazing and has evolved to include trip details, earning summaries and great rewards that rival many US Fortune 100's offerings. As to earnings, Uber provides a real opportunity for drivers to make good money doing a highly rewarding job on a full-time or part-time basis. At first, Uber will enter a market with a much lower price than the taxi services to help boost the customer base but they are also smart enough to know that price increases are also necessary to reflect the higher level of service that Uber delivers while still providing personal transportation at lower prices than taxis. With the latest revolution in Kansas and Missouri Taxi Code to solidly position Uber in Kansas City for the longterm, drivers should expect to make hourly rates in excess of $30 per hour due to increased demand. It's great to see that Uber, and Uber Riders, has elevated the job of driving for personal transportation to an attractive opportunity for students, single parents, single-mothers, veterans, ex-taxi drivers and anyone who wants to sup,went their income or make a good salary on a full-time basis. THANK YOU UBER FOR PROVIDING OPPORTUNITY FOR MANY IN KANSAS CITY AND FOR MAKING PEOPLE HAPPY!!!",5,uber.com
728,"Heres the way to look at Uber from a different perspective. I live in Newport Beach California, I get up about 5:00 am and hit the road. Trips to the airport are common this time of the morning. LAX trips at least 5 times a week. Before 9:00 am i have made around 50.00 Take a break until I feel like it. Drive mid to late afternoon in by 8:30 pm I just made 120.00 I average 700.00 a week x 4 equals 2800.00 Nice little addition to my V.A. disability. You have to run this as a business. You dont drive you dont get paid period end of story. If you have problems with the navigation how about changing what your using. Waze is awesome with the Uber app. I don't see how anyone can consider this as being an employee. I work when I want to. I take off for vacation when I want to. No one is in charge of me to tell me when to drive or where to drive. And for those of you who complain about the maintenance on your car. Well, You should be keeping the maintenance on it any way. No wonder most of you got engine trouble. Using your car while working is a huge tax advantage. Oh insurance.... You are required by law to have that any way. A little extra coverage may be required but to me its worth it.  Some drivers have bad experiences with driving for Uber. If you drive in a bad area guess what you gonna get bad riders. But alas! You have control of who gets in your car. Boot em out. Say thanks but no thanks and go on about our business. I drive in a very good area and in business areas. On occasion i get a really stupid jerk wagon. Guess what? He no ride with me. Stop complaining if you peeps cant run a business and figure this Uber thing out. I m sure Chuck E Cheese has a spot for you behind the Pizza counter.",5,uber.com

738,"I have been a long time rider with LYFT but that is OVER. I had a driver pick me up a couple days ago in Buffalo, NY. As usual, I took the back seat. I was preoccupied with something on my phone and did not realize the driver had an ""unauthorized third party"" - a female companion - who was riding along in the car until we were a couple blocks into the ride and after the driver had deviated from the route, driving through several unfamiliar side neighborhoods as a ""short cut"".  I reported this incident to Lyft and requested a refund (or credit) for *this* ride. The refund was requested because the driver VIOLATED LYFTs contract with me - their customer.  Per LYFT's grossly substandard (seriously - it's hot garbage) customer service department - I ""should have"" canceled the ride in the middle of a trip and exited the vehicle *in a strange neighborhood* and then called a new LYFT to take me where I wanted to go --  Seems legit - it totally makes sense that I should not only put myself at additional risk by escalating a situation with a driver who CLEARLY HAS NO REGARD FOR THE RULES AND PROTOCOLS OF HIS JOB - but also I should pay 2 base fees for their ill-trained driver breaking their contract. LYFT's outsourced ""Quezon City"" customer service team has not only lost this company MY business as a longtime rider but also ensured that the app was uninstalled by the 3 OTHER RIDERS in my household who also previously used their service.",1,lyft.com
739,"I normally never write a bad review but, his time I need to. The location of my home was never a problem for previous drivers. Recently the drivers have not been able to find my house. It might be a G.P.S. Issue. I watched the progress map as the driver passed my house. I contacted the driver, to tell her my exact location. She began yelling at me and wouldn't stop. I didn't take the ride. I hope I don't get charged another cancellation fee after that abuse. About two months ago I scheduled a ride by error. I immediately called the driver to cancel, but I was charged a cancellation fee anyway. Some of the drivers are very rude, you never know what you're in for. I would not take Lyft if I were you. The service is unreliable. My experience with customer service is so-so. I requested a call back and their system called me and put me on hold blasting the most irritating music ever. The first person I spoke with was attentive and apologetic. He transferred me over to the billing department for a refund on the previous ride. I spoke with a truly snippy brat and she, of course, patronized me and denied me a refund. Lyft was a good service at first. I don't know what's happened. If you can get another ride, you should do so.",1,lyft.com
740,"this is a scam and the app won't even let you register. good thing, too, because most people report sheisty dealings with the payments, etc.",1,lyft.com
741,"lyft just cut the pay again ..... Doesn't Recommend Negative Outlook Disapproves of CEO DONT DO IT ....  A 150 car payment cost over 1000 a month plus you are on a different pay platform so you will starve..  what a joke way less than wage I can't really set my own hours, because I have to work very early in the morning and very late at night to get enough rides to earn any money. Not many rides are requested in the middle of the afternoon. Many passengers don't tip, and often I earn below minimum wage. The pay to drivers is way too low. Lyft takes a cut off the top, and then splits what is left with the driver. Lyft used to take 20 percent of what's left. Now they take more - 25 percent. The bonus Lyft pays toward the cost of the rental car has decreased several times. The minimum number of rides a driver must complete to get the rental cost bonus has gone up and up - to the point where it is almost unattainable. The cost of the rental car keeps going up - now $230 per week. Sometimes the app malfunctions, causing me to miss rides. Lyft aggressively recruits drivers to the point a Lyft driver is on every corner. So much driver competition means sometimes I get one ride per hour, and the average pay per ride is $4. If I drove around trying to get a ride instead of parking, I might have spent $3 on gas. If I park too long, Lyft kicks me off the app, and I have to move my car to log in again. The people who are happy working for Lyft are those who work in corporate offices. They probably get paid well. I work about 30-45 hours per week, and I take home about $500-800 per month. That's after paying about $720 per month for the rental car (after bonuses are credited). And that's before I pay taxes on my money earned. That's not a living wage. Lyft tells passengers the driver gets all the tip money when the passenger tips through the app. That's true - Lyft doesn't take any of it, but the driver has to pay taxes on it. Cash tips, though rare, are better. Sometimes I get home after a 9 hour shift of driving on busy freeways, and in downtown traffic, turning left and right, watching traffic lights, watching my GPS, avoiding pedestrians, concerning myself with my passenger's music and indoor temperature, holding a conversation, making sure my passengers aren't late for work, or don't miss their flights, and get home from the party safely, and I clean my car of the donut sprinkles they ate in my back seat and the dog hair they had on their shoes and the snot they wiped on the door handle, and I lay down and feel as if I'm still moving, and I feel very used, under appreciated, and underpaid. Five stars doesn't support me and my daughter. Show Less Advice to Management Pay your drivers more. Quit double-dipping in drivers pay by taking a cut off the top, and then taking 25 percent before paying drivers. Do one or the other, not both. Pay drivers 80 percent commission, instead of 75 percent - you can afford it. Stop recruiting so many drivers. Not enough passengers exist for the number of drivers you have. My deductible on auto insurance for your rental car is $2,500. Find better insurance for your drivers. Educate passengers about how little drivers earn, and why passengers need to tip a driver who has provided good service. Even fifty cents is better than nothing. Some passengers can't afford to tip, I understand.... but almost every passenger can afford fifty cents or twenty five cents. Even that would add up. If Lyft would pay drivers more, tips wouldn't be such a big deal, and drivers could rest assured they would earn a decent living that week. More advice to management... reduce the cost of rental cars. When the new year comes, and the car is one year older - reduce the rental fee. Give drivers the choice of a new car at a higher rate, or a 4 year old car at a lower rate. Lower the minimum number of rides required to receive a rental bonus. Show drivers where the passenger is going before the driver accepts the ride. If I have to pick up my daughter in an hour and a half, I can't take a 2+ hour ride to the airport. So you say, ""then don't drive, log out."" I can't log out two hours before I need to get off work every day. I wouldn't earn any money that way. Also, quit cancelling rides when you think a driver isn't moving toward their passenger. Sometimes a driver is headed in the wrong direction when the ride is requested, or they are in the left turn lane when the new ride request requires a right turn. The driver needs to find a safe place to turn around. Same goes for passengers cancelling rides. Sometimes your driver needs to turn around. Sometimes a u-turn is unsafe or illegal. Sometimes a railroad track is between the driver and the passenger, and the driver needs to go to where a road crosses the track. Passengers (and the app) need to have some patience. Lyft needs to educate passengers about this. Drivers know they are being used and abused until the day self-driving cars are on the road, and drivers will be cast aside. That's a crappy feeling - that we have helped to build a mega company and will be disposed of. That's a crappy reputation you are building. You claim to be lifting people up by allowing them the opportunity to be a driver on your platform, but you are not. If you really wanted to Lyft them up, you could bonus them shares of stock or vesting in company ownership. That would change the whole game. Right now - the way it is - drivers are getting the shaft, and corporate people are becoming uber rich. Lyft's business model is terrible for the drivers. Just like most other large corporations, you are stepping on the little guys to get where you are going. Look at Chobani Yogurt's business model. The workers got a stake in the company. The company actually cares about the workers who made them what they are. The workers actually care about the company. It's a win-win. Lyft should take note, and appreciate the people who helped them reach and exceed their goals.",1,lyft.com
742,"I used to like Lyft because it wasn't Uber. However, their new Shared Ride feature has forced me to remove my profile. I had to go to work and my father, who uses a walker, needed to go to his doctor. I dropped him off at his doctor's office and went my way to work. An hour later, I was contacted that his appointment was over. So, I got a shared Lyft ride for my father to get him home. Several minutes later, I got a notification from the Lyft app that the I was charged a $5 no show fee. I contacted my father and he told me that he was trying to get to the Lyft car driven by Moises with a Toyota Corolla with a partial license plate of 7SUA who drove by really fast and waited at the end of the block. A reminder that my father uses a walker. Apparently, you have to be at the car within a minute or else lose your ride. My father cannot walk that fast and you expect him to walk to the car within a minute where it would take him five to get to the car? I did not get a call from Moises asking me where my father was. I was so upset that this guy does not have any customer service skills that I left work angrily and drove to my father's location as fast as possible before something bad happens to him. That was it for me. If Lyft and that driver wanted to make quick money without the responsibility of actually providing the service I had ask for, I say for everyone of you to delete your accounts and no longer use their service and don't get a ride from Moises either. Don't let something like this happen to you or your loved one so you can be taken advantage of or even worse, something bad happens to you or your loved one using their service.",1,lyft.com

747,"I have ridden over 60 rides with Lyft services. All have been average to great experiences with the exception of my last ride. The last occasion I rode with Lyft I left an item in one of their drivers vehicles , and realized within a 5 minutes time span that I had left it. I contacted the driver back while walking into my office and he didn't answer. Throughout the day he proceeded to ignore my calls and messages. I finally reached him later that night and he explained that he didn't see or didn't find it in his vehicle. This was very hard to believe considering I was sitting in the front, it was left in the front seat, and it was bright silver and pink. He advised me to contact the Lyft Help support which advised there was pretty much nothing they could do because basically it was my fault I left it in the drivers car. Although it wasn't my fault the driver decided to keep it and ignore me the rest of the day. Its whatever I guess I will take it as a loss because to Lyft , it was MY FAULT that I had a dishonest driver. If my driver would have just answered my calls instead of deciding he wanted to keep my wallet than there wouldn't have been an issue. Then again Lyfts current policy does absolutely nothing to infringe punishment or justice for individuals who decide to keep lost items. So basically if I was my driver, I would have kept it as well because I knew nothing would have happened to me. There is absolutely no form of deterrence present in their policy.  Altogether with what was lost in the wallet and the cost of my last ride, I payed $213 out of pocket for that 10 minute ride , one in which I have regretted every day since then. Lyft needs to review their policy on lost or stolen items, or maybe just need to employ more honest individuals. Either way I will never be requesting or referring their services to anyone else.",1,lyft.com

They did not even bother to ask everyone of recent passengers to confrim or simply call and talk to her....they simply shut her down and her her account on the spot over a fake report  Of course I immediately knew that this was a lie, because she would never ever do such a thing and the fact that she could not stop crying while telling me what happened, made me so very angry that I decided to write this review and my first hand experience with this ungrateful, disloyal and mismanaged company that treats their biggest assets like garbage. USING THESE POOR PEOPLE THAT RISK THEIR LIVES ON A DAILY BASIS TO MAKE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR THIS COMPANY, WHILE THEY GET PEANUTS TO BARELY PAY THEIR BILLS AND DISCARD THEM LIKE TRASH AND MAKE NO EFFORT TO PROTECT THEM AGAINST THIS KIND OF ABUSE They did not even bothered to read any of the raving reviews that describe her as one of the best and the safest driver in Los Angeles. They would have quickly realized that not only what was reported was FAKE, but completely against her characteristics and her driving history...OTHERWISE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE SUCH AN IMMACULATE DRIVING RECORD AFTER ALMOST 10 YEARS OF DRIVING IN THIS TOWN she does not even have one parking ticket, LET ALONE A DUI...AS IT WAS CLAIMED so whomever that made that false report must have been either one of those rejected $#*!s that hit on a pretty young female driver every chance they get and could not take NO FOR AN ANSWER! or maybe an insecure girlfriend finding her BF drooling like a Dog the minute they get in that car, because She is a million times prettier and charming that them....but whatever the reason, IT WAS ABSOLUTELY OBVIOUS THAT THIS WAS A TOTAL BOGUS REPORT!

UP $#*!! WE DON'T $#*!ING LIVE IN SAUDI ARABIA, AND PEOPLE ARE NOT ASSUMED GUILTY BEFORE PROVEN INNOCENT, BUT OUR CONSTITUTION SIMPLY SAYS:  In the United States, a person is considered innocent until proven guilty.

And for this very reason, I promised to make an example out of her case for all the innocent drivers that have been falsely accused and abused by this company.

After being hung up on by someone who claims to be a supervisor. I took a look at my bank account and found that Lyft tried to authorize $15.00 from not only one account, but two accounts even though there is nearly $80.00 in gift card credit sitting on my Lyft app. One my personal accounts declined (thank God) and the other accounts placed the authorization and reversed it soon afterward. I soon found out from a representative who calls herself Carolyn that Lyft authorizes $15.00 even though you have credit because its set up that way in the system. She said its in the terms of service. So I will be contacting the BBB and making a complaint. My ride history doesnt show records of this charge and no alert to this policy was given.

765,"Here are explanations for all your problems with LYFT SCHEDULED PICKUP service: Questions: Have you had problems with getting a Lyft driver to accept your Lyft Schedule Pickup service? Have you had problems with no drivers picking you up, or cancelling our pick up service? Answers: I was told by customer service at Lyft that your pickup location is automatically assigned by the Lyft computer system to the nearest Active Online Lyft Driver at the time of your pickup time and location. If the nearest Lyft driver is nearby (e.g. 3 mins away), you most likely will not have a problem. BUT, if the ""nearest"" Active Online Lyft Driver is 20 or 30 minutes away, the Lyft computer system defaults to assigning your Scheduled pickup ride to that far away Active Online Lyft Driver. What will likely happen is that Lyft Driver will cancel your pickup. Why? The economics of the Lyft ride is unprofitable to the Lyft Driver. Example: It is not profitable for a Lyft driver to drive 30 minutes and 15 miles in heavy city traffic to accept a Lyft Scheduled Pickup fare that is a 5 mile service ride that will take 10 minutes. Why would a Lyft Driver (who is trying to make a profit) accept a 5 mile service ride, but drive 15 miles to the Lyft Schedule pickup location? Most Lyft drivers want to make money, thus this example is NOT profitable. This is why LYFT customers experience these problems with Lyft Schedule Pickup service. Why am I writing this review on sitejabber? Because the Lyft Customer Service Representative I spoke to (Roger), refuses to listen or comprehend that the Lyft Company has an opportunity to FIX these problems. When I spoke to the Lyft 3rd party customer service rep, I suggested that these fundamental flaws in this Lyft Scheduled Pickup service need to be investigated so that they can improve the service. BUT, the response I received from the 3rd party Lyft customer service rep (named Roger) was ""you don't need to use this service if you don't like it."" And he said ""this problem happens to everyone"" which is why you don't have to use this Scheduled Pickup service. The 3rd Party Lyft customer service representative FAILS to see that this is an enterprise and strategic issue that is causing major dissatisfaction to both LYFT RIDERS (Customers) and LYFT DRIVERS (service providers). If Lyft does not solve this fundamental problem that frequently or occasionally occurs (example - assigning pick up rides to drivers 15 miles away, but the fare is only a 5 mile service ride) the ECONOMICS to Lyft Drivers will continually cause dissatisfaction to Lyft Scheduled Pick up customers.    A Lyft Customer Service representative told me all of this. This Lyft Scheduled Pickup service is relatively new. They have not fixed the kinks out of the service. Also - For all of you having problems when you text, chat, or talk to Lyft Customer Service reps about all of your Lyft ride service problems.... The people you talk on the phone are NOT actual Lyft employees. They are ""partners"" to Lyft. What this means is Lyft outsourced the telephone customer service to a 3rd party. This 3rd party company does not seem to care about you the Lyft Customer. They don't appear to be welled trained about Lyft either.",1,lyft.com

767,"In NY, the drivers never ever pick you up where you request. You have to find out where they stop and hope you can get to where THEY decide to pick you up before they leave and have to pay a $10 no show fee. LYFT should be charged with fraud.

Driver was super and the ride to the winery was perfect. Later in the evening I logged into my app to order a ride home and was very surprised to find that I was now ""not in their service area"". Lyft provided the 8.5 mile ride one way - but was unable to get me back home. I set up an Uber account and got home via Uber. To compensate me for the inconvenience, Lyft offered 2 $5.00 credits for separate rides. The credits expire in one month. This doesn't help me at all and I asked them to cancel my account. It took 3 emails to get them to agree to deactivate my account. Not a fan of Lyft.",1,lyft.com

I noticed immediately and went into track mode to contact Inran the driver.

This was at 3:07pm, it is now 12:35AM and still no answer from LYFT or Imran, I keep calling them to get updates and nothing yet, I also asked to speak to a Manager and they said the Manager will call me back and hasn't done so either. This is unacceptable and POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. I know LYFT is cheaper than UBER and that's why I went with your company, but as of today and the inconvenience and anxiety that I am going through I will be reconsidering LYFT. This is a work phone and it may cost me my job.

The instructions say click on clock on the app BUT there is NO clock to click and NO reason why. I have exhausted every possible method of trying to figure this out and have zero results. You would think a company that is in direct competition would be able to tell a customer why the app is not behaving as described.

NOW the hold is $25. So today I get to the store 1 mile away and my card declines in the store, for my 3 items.

779,"This car company has the worst and most dangerous drivers. I am a tourist from India and was in a Lyft car in LA. The driver made a wrong turn and slammed into another car. My shoulder was severely injured.This was on 9/1.I got an email from them saying that they were sorry and asked me how I was.I told them that I was in severe pain and had to visit the UCLA emergency room and Urgent care in Venice and sent them the medical bills.Some people from Lyft,their insurance company,the driver's insurance company etc were in touch with me for a few days after the accident. Since I had no insurance,I have had to pay all medical expenses myself.I have spent several thousand dollars on medical expenses on what was supposed to be a vacation.Besides this I have had an MRI taken(cost $600).I have a severely torn rotator cuff and may have to have a surgery. This is mid-Oct and I have heard nothing from them even though I have tried calling them several times.The last time I called they said it could be the other driver's fault and I should contact him and his insurance company. What a joke! It's mid Oct and they are still denying that it was their driver's fault! I have Bliss, Uber and Lyft apps on my phone.Why is it that I only get emails from Lyft telling me to become one of their drivers and I can make a few hundred a week doing so? It's because they hire unqualified, cheap and dangerous drivers who can drive their passengers to their grave. Dont use Lyft if you value your life. Pay a little more and use one of the others.I have had a very painful and expensive lesson with Lyft.I will never use it again and would advise anyone who values their health never to do so as well.

How can you have drivers and even customer service representatives that cannot help you and cannot be trusted.? I will not give any more money to these horrible people. Not even the supervisor has been help.  Lyft support was the most difficult support care Ive ever had to contact or speak to. My issue was not resolved in anyway.

790,Lyft is a scam they cheat drivers out of their money when you drive to passengers location to pick them up than passenger cancels on you when you are almost there the driver wastes their gas and time and does not get money compensated . They claim you make at least $20 dollars an hour if not more you don't you have to drive 12 hours to make maybe a $100 bucks take out gas wear and tear on car $70 . Passengers make messes in your car and most of them don't tip . Passengers put drivers in a safety risk by not having a photo on their profile account and letting others use their account instead of themselves so who knows if some convict got out of jail and stole their stuff and uses account. They do background check on drivers but not passengers drivers have not idea if passengers have mental health issues just got out of jail for murder nothing they don't care about the safety of the drivers. They deactivate drivers all the time for a comment in box by passengers so anyone can make up a story and put poor drivers out on the streets for false claims even after they see you have a great driving record and clean background checkI strongly don't recommend driving for Lyft,1,lyft.com

I immediately called the company to dispute this charge as it should not cost $50 to clean a small amount of sugar off of a seat. The operator on the phone agreed with me that it was a high charge for the circumstance and filed a report so that it can be investigated. But, 3 days later I received an email saying they will not be refunding my money as they felt the charge was accurate.

796,"I recently signed up to drive for lyft, I rented a car from their express offer which allows me to rent a car from Hertz on a weekly basis. What we had originally agreed to was I would drive from Friday the 18th, to Friday the 25th, and if I made X amount of rides I wouldn't be charged a rental fee. They changed their policy so all drivers have to make the rides from Monday to Monday. Because I did not drive that week, it was impossible for me to make the 75 rides from Friday to Sunday and they are now attempting to charge my bank card 89.17 for the prorated week. I have tried multiple times to contact them about this and they will not reply back as all communications are done through email.  Further more, I went to pick someone up at the airport and was fined 200$ for not having a LYFT sticker on my vehicle. I also contacted them about this as they expected me to drive without the sticker which they said they were mailing that I never received. I have told them to pick their vehicle up in many emails which I am more than happy to provide.  I have about 50$ in earnings that I was supposed to receive today which it appears I am not getting. They will not contact nor help resolve these issues with me at all, not to mention the stress of the entire communication being handled via email. which I feel is a disservice to the drivers as it allows them to blow off whom they choose.  It is impossible for anyone to make 74 rides over a weekend as I did not feel comfortable driving without the LYFT sticker. On Monday I decided to start driving without the sticker against my better judgment as I now have a 200$ fine from the airport I cannot afford to pay. Especially with all the charges they are trying to get me to pay.  I was not aware of the airport policy for ride share drivers as none of the videos they have give any real information about airport policy in terms of where to park and how to get there.  These are unfair practices that take advantage of people who are self motivated and desire to be their own boss in charge of their own schedule. I feel taken for granted, used, and railroaded as this is very deceitful what they are doing.

Lyft does not hold up to there end of the deal.",1,lyft.com
808,"I have used Uber and Lyft until this past year. In my opinion, Uber is a far better option. Its always cheaper (although often not by much). In my area there are dozens of drivers available within minutes with Uber while Lyft, having fewer drivers takes at least 15 minutes to arrive. The Uber drivers have nicer cars, Lyft is a toss up. Most are nice, many are notand you have no choice about your ride until it arrives. Twice I have gotten stuck with Lyft cars that wreak of cigarette smoke and dozens of times my driver does not speak ANY English. I live in Texas!!! Furthermore, Lyft drivers have dropped my ride because they cant find mewhich means I have a new driver and start my wait all over again. Thats frustrating, to say the least. Lastly, Lyft is constantly sending me offers. I mean, daily until I adjusted my mail settings. The offers sound good, but they rarely are what they seem. Customer Service is terrible. The Lyft drivers expect a tip on top of pay.",1,lyft.com
809,Lyft stole my rental deposit my tips and my wages from driving don't drive for them you'll just end up paying almost a thousand dollars and the express pay doesn't work at all they wont pay you anything and dont even try to contact lyft support they'll just lie to you over and over and give you the run around,1,lyft.com
810,So I sign up for Lyft with my friends code referral complete 500 rides and get 2000 dollars looks like I'm not gettting that at all cause they made some $#*!ty blame saying that I touch someone's leg which is such a lied cause all passengers sit in the back they do this for you not to get bonus they knew that I was close to hit the 500 rides so they screw me and shot down my app so I don't accept any rides I been email them no response what so ever this people don't care they just want their money,1,lyft.com
811,So they lure you into buying a promo pass at $4.99 but failed to tell you that you cannot use it unless you're in a certain area. Once I bought the pass I had access to a map that shows the exact coverage area that was not available before I purchased the pass. When I emailed them asking for a refund they told me no...  I guess Lyft needs the money that they cannot support their customers I replied back to the customer service lady that I will be deleting the app and canceling my account and posting reviews on social media. Please avoid this company as I also have Uber and never have any customer service issues with refunds or correct clarification to disputes .,1,lyft.com
812,"A rider scheduled 2 drop off's. When I arrive at the 1st drop off the rider wanted me to cancel the 2nd drop, so i canceled. Cncelling the 2nd drop off also canceled the 1st drop off. Therefore I didn't get paid for either trip. I emailed lyft several times about this error and I was told that I would get paid the following week. Never recieved my pay as of today, a month later. I received an email stating that trip was included in a bonus, that I never saw. Giving me BS is what they did. Lyft will rip u off if u don pay attention to your earnings. I will never drive for Lyft again.",1,lyft.com

815,"Please do NOT use Lyft!!! I usually use Uber but my brother arranged for my ride this time and used Lyft. It was late, maybe around 2am on Saturday 6/24. I had left my vehicle at the restaurant we had eaten dinner at and needed a ride home from his house in Parker, Colorado, to my home in Littleton. It was about a 20 minute ride, I was alone in the backseat of the driver's car. The car ride was fine and everything seemed normal...A few days after that $150 in ""damages"" was deducted from my brother's account. We were so confused as to why, so he tried getting ahold of Lyft immediately...of course there was absolutely NO way to get ahold of someone on the phone so he had to email them and wait a few days for the response...the Lyft driver claimed that I threw up in the backseat of her car, so they charged $150 clean up fee!!!! I was and still am just blown away by what a fraud this lady is! I absolutely did NOT vomit in her vehicle!! This con artist even submitted some bogus pictures!! Lyft did not contact us or even notify us about her claim. They just took it upon themselves to deduct $150 from my brother account!!! They didn't even investigate it! Lyft along with their driver are a bunch of crooks!!! Please, please be careful when using this company! Take pictures of the area you sit before and after your ride! I'm filing a claim against them and that specific driver. I have photos that were taken of me prior to the ride and photos of when I arrived home... In the same clothes...not a hair out of place. What scam artists!!! I just didn't understand why she would do this...then it dawned on me...I had left my purse in my vehicle. I assumed my brother tipped her when he paid for the ride. I called my brother to see if he tipped her and unfortunately he didn't and assumed I would. Which is absolutely terrible and I would never let any service provider go without a tip!! But now it makes complete sense and shows her motive behind her claim. Still no excuse to rip off your customer!!",1,lyft.com
816,I started driving with Lyft with a feeling of optimism and now I wish I never had. First of all the pay is not very good at all after you calculate gas and wear tear and taxes. Honestly I think I'd do better at most entry level jobs.They try to lure you into different areas with higher pay percentages but when you arrive in them they either take away the increased percentage or you get a ride just outside of this area. But aside from the pathetic pay the worst thing about Lyft is the absolutely horrible support they offer for their drivers. They consistently take days to reply and even then they usually don't do anything to resolve this issue. Seriously the worst experience I've ever had with any company ever. Don't believe me? Download the app and try to contact them. Then delete the app and forget any notions you ever had of driving for them . You can thank me later,1,lyft.com
817,"Because most drivers are not well informed and educated on what it costs to drive every mile, they think that they are making money and continue to devaluate their cars while driving all those miles that don't compensate for all the related expenses. This is a dangerous job that deserves to be paid accordingly. When you are always looking for an address, you are not so attentive to all the dangers of the road. Yet, Lyft and Uber pay little money: about $3.25 for about 20 or 30 minutes of driving. I did some rides that paid $6.00 and took about 50 minutes. Their incentives are very deceiving because they require driving during very heavy traffic hours and not very ideal situations. You need to maintain 90% acceptance which is hard given that often you would have to accept rides that take you very far away, from where you would need to drive back empty, absorbing all the cost. On top of this, Lyft has not customer service. It takes days to get any answers and they are often not helpful. They have no physical locations to go to get problems resolved. I was robbed by a passenger and got absolutely on help from them. They did not cooperate with the police to identify the suspect which they knew. If Uber is bad, Lyft is much worse. They also use more deceiving practices than Uber. They make you think that you are getting paid a certain amount when in reality that is what they are collecting from the passenger. You don't have access to each ride record on line that you can use to document events during the ride or submit a complain/request. Stop driving for Lyft or Uber if you are doing it. Any other job is much better because you make some money.",1,lyft.com

821,I took a $6 rise and they charged me $15 twice.. I called and asked about the charges and they told me it's them just check to see if I have enough for the ride. But really? So you charge $15 twice for it? And they said I would have to wait 3-5 business days for it to refund in my account now let's say I was in a emergency and I needed that money. How are you going to tell me I have to wait a certain amount of days to get money that I already earned? They help themselves to your bank account I'm very displeased.. and as for safety. They let an Lyft drive pick me up in a whole different car that was not register for Lyft and there was also another person in the car which made e feel extra uncomfortable. Lyft is just terrible I will no longer be continuing business with them. I will now use Uber although it's a bit more complicating and expensive I'll take that over someone charging my card to whatever amount they want.,1,lyft.com

Why will you send a driver to drive 20 or more minutes to pike up a rider knowing hopefully we'll the rider is just going a mile or less? And when the drive cancel you want to deactivate the driver. If still don't get it how lyft called her driver independent contractors and still can deactivate drivers for cancellation. If drivers are independent contractor, they should be able to decide if to accept or cancel a rider. Lyft is awful and that is why they can't keep drivers.

830,"If you are a New upcoming Driver, lyft will hook you up with awesome rides.. They entice new drivers with making money fast and giving them a pleasant experience. **NOTE** Once you are hooked and engaging in working more hours. Lyft will gradually Lower your rides per hour and will also make it impossible for you to hit the bonus.. ""YES"" LYFT controls how much you make per hour.. When you look at your Dashboard to opt in to weekly power bonus. It gives you zones and times you could make 20% or even 30% more driving these hours.. **NOTE** If you are getting close to getting your bonus LYFT will stop you from achieving your goal by taking the power bonus feature off your app so you won't be able to access it.. When you see your map of where high demand is and you are actually there.. Best believe that lyft will get you a request far away from the high demand zone and hook you up with a ride that will take you further out so you won't achieve making more money for that hour.. A Driver will typically make 19 to 17 an hour after LYFT takes their fees.. . No matter how good your strategies are to make more money they would slow your request down.. EXAMPLE if you are making $180 dollars in 5 hours that's $36 an hour.. Guess what? Lyft doesn't want you to make that much an hour so they will lower your hour income by giving you smaller rides that would be 10-15 minutes long,.. paying you an average of $3-4 dollars for that ride to having no request for the next 20-30 minutes.. Have you ever wonder why there is no request coming in, in your area,.. where the map shows it's super pink in high demand? That's only because lyft knows your making more money then what they allow per hour and they are giving the request to those that either just started their shift or has seniority over you and gives them the rides.. LYFT also has friends and relatives that works for the company giving them always the first dibs on awesome rides.. Have you ever wonder why you get a request in and within seconds to a minute it shows on your screen passenger cancelled request!?? Rarely passengers do cancel but in other times the passenger is taking a longer trip paying extra $$$ money and lyft takes the passenger away from you showing you on your end that they cancelled on your app when in reality they haven't cancelled and clientele is given to those special drivers they have working out on the field in that same area.. MANY customers have also said that they like how LYFT has the feature for tipping their drivers when a ride is completed .. Guess what?? LYFT doesn't always report the exact tip amount to drivers of what passengers give to their drivers. They show their drivers a smaller amount to none for that ride. They say that tips are 100% for drivers. When in reality the drivers don't get exactly what the customer pays out. Another thing LYFT says to their drivers that the amount shown on their screen after each ride has completed is the amount they charged each passenger.. That's totally misleading.. LYFT reports on your app a different smaller amount of what they have already taken out for that passenger ride embezzling extra money without the Driver noticing that the amount shown on their screen has already been modified.. **NOTE** LYFT claims that they only take out their 20-25% off their drivers when they want to cash out. WRONG!.! LYFT has already taken out a percentage for each ride and slaps their driver with their 20-25% on top what they have already taken out per ride.. EVER WONDER how LYFT can offer a higher bonus to NEW and CURRENT DRIVERS? Simple... they simply take extra money from their drivers how I mention above and puts it back in their pocket ""IF"" they hit the bonus.. Its not really a bonus. It's the DRIVERS own money that LYFT took out without the driver noticing, of what they took off each trip, and makes it seem that they are a generous company to their hard working employees.. For those that have notice and are COMPLAINING!! LYFT will lower your Rate & income request up to 60% . And what you use to make in 8-12 hours. Best believe LYFT will give you $#*!ty rides to 1 or 2 rides per hour and the drivers would work same hours to have barely $100 made for that day.. LYFT controls who you get wheather it's a 5.0 customer to a 4.0 passenger.. How this could be addressed is, drivers should unite and do a class action Law suit against LYFT so they know not to be greedy and be liars to those hard working Americans who are only working to pay bills and feed their love ones.",1,lyft.com

832,I have had so much trouble with this company and random charges it's unfortunate. Driver service is so much better than uber but I would recommend uber over this company solely for the fact that they've now charged my card TEN times with zero authorization. If this is a systematic issue that's unfortunate as I've reached out to multiple Lyft associates to get the issue resolved. It's been two weeks since I've brought it to someone's attention (multiple times) at Lyft & no they haven't resolved it. But they surely have managed to charge my card two more times since. It's almost like it doesn't matter at all to them. 0 points for Lyft & genuinely caring about customer service.

There is no way to file a dispute on their website. Called their toll free number, it told me to go to the site.

835,"I was approved to drive with Lyft at the end of Feb. this yr. I was only driving for 4 days then I ended up in he hospital to ave emergency. I even emailed them to let them know what was gong on. Then after i was cleared from my doctor I only was able to drive for 1 day & i ended up back in the hospital because of complacations from the surgery. I let them know that also. I even emailed them and asked if they could give me an extension for my drivers bonus because of due to the emergency surgery. They responded by telling me that I never entered a drivers promo code. I even sent them the copy of the code I used when I applied. I was only 20 rides away from getting my bonus. They even approved my new car. 2 days after they approved my new car I received an email from them telling me that i would not be able to drive due to some safety issue. That's all they told me. I emailed them back & I wanted to know what the problem was. They responded by telling me my rating was to low & a passenger said that I refused to get out of my car when I was asked to. Well the problem with that is at no time durning those 5 days that I drove I never had a passenger that was disabled that need assistance. I always got out of my car if my passenger had luggage, I personally put their luggage in the trunk of my car & I removed it when I dropped them off at their destination. The thing is the passenger doesn't always rate the driver right after their ride sometimes it takes them 3 to 4 days later to rate their ride. So they do get the drivers mixed up. Lyft does not give yo any type of training they only give you a platform to work off of. So you will fail right away. They said that they were investigating the issue. The problem with that they never even talk to me about the issue. They also stopped me from driving before I got my total hours in for my driving bonus. I'm not the only one they have done this to about the driving bonus. I have spoken to other people that work or have worked for Lyft and they never received their driver bonus either. How can a company let you go only after 5 days of being a driver without really investigating both sides of the issue. My ratings were not low enough to let me go. They never give you any training at all. They do not stand behind their word. Plus their are other problems. I had riders that I picked up that said I was only picking up 1 person & sometimes ended up being up to 4 total & I had no way to add the 3 extra people to the ride. I have emailed them everyday for almost a month since they said I cold not drive because of the issue & they have never responded back to any of my emails. Just to let you know the riders tat did rate me gave me 5 stars. example 7 out of 10 gave me a perfect score on everything & 5 stars. You do not want to work for them. Plus they add people to your ride without giving you the chance to accept it or to refuse it. Some of my passengers had to be at an appt. at a certain time & I could not accept the ride that they wanted me to pick up. That is not fair to the passenger you have in your car at the time since they have an appt. they have to get to by a certain time. If you were a passenger and you had an appt. at a certain time would you want to be late or on time? Lyft never even gives you a chance to work.

847,"A letter to Lyft Good morning, As a concerned Mother of a minor child, I believe strongly your system needs to be addressed. My 17 year old son was able to create an account reflecting he was over the age of 18. Are your passengers not required to show proof of their identification upon pick up? My second concern involves the actual pick up from my home. Two people stood in the yard flailing their arms and shouting for the driver to stop. The passenger side door of the vehicle was opened at the time. I find it hard to believe he could not hear or see us. It is a no outlet street with a speed limit of 25mph. He pulled away in rapid fashion and was down the street like a shot. I find it hard to believe he was going 25mph on our street or the connecting residential road. Perhaps he was afraid of what the situation may become. However, he made an already difficult situation harder to resolve. My final concern with your service proves most disconcerting. When I contacted your business for help needing the dropoff location, I was told this could not be disclosed. Given I am the parent of a minor who was leaving without permission and unbeknownst to his family, you need a system in place to aid the parent or legal guardian rather than abetting a minor child who happens to have a debit card and a job. While our personal situation was reconciled, it was through no help of your organization. The legal ramifications of the 'what-ifs' for your company given your current system could prove costly for you and harmful for the minor. Regardless of whether the child was being placed or placing themselves in a dangerous situation, Lyft needs to revisit the systems in place in order to posture yourself as an advocate rather than adversary to this type of scenario.

848,"This company gets a poor rating in every level. Bad drivers, Thief drivers and company! Ordered a lyft and got a text that the driver would be there in a minute. If i was not outside in a minute it would leave and charge me. Literally gives no chance to get to find the car in a busy area. They dont call you, nothing.. just drive away. Second and most important, i left a phone in the car and as soon as i realized it i call the number and the phone was switched off. I contacted customer service and it took them 3 days to get back to me because they said they driver had not responded! This was unacceptable. And of course, the driver finally gets back and says he knows nothing. I was able to pin the phone to an address and they refuse to backtrack and see who could have it.. because it probably is the same driver!! THIEF!!!!! Lyft customer service woundnt give me any info without a subpoena. Basically encouraging and protecting their theifs.",1,lyft.com

Also after emailing them to tell them what happened I got a response ""we are sorry you were experiencing problems with your app here's $5 credit"" first off a driver not showing up after conformation and reminder has nothing to do with my app it's the driver's incompetence and shove your $5 where the sun doesn't shine!",1,lyft.com

I never knew of any promo codes, and I also wrote an email within days of my hire asking what promotions I would be available for. They are denying me my bonus based on a BS technicality, plain and simple. Plus, it is hard to find riders altogether, regardless of time or day. My last week I logged 33 hours and made $375.52.

I can't afford to have money in my accounts on hold for no good reason. I paid my bill and the charges they process should be what people owe.

We have deleted all payment methods off her account and the issue was still not fixed. I contacted Lyft customer support to try to solve this. They basically told me I should fix the issue with my girlfriend and they would block her account until we ""sorted things out"" I told them this was an awful solution as I just needed them to check why her account was charging my card and to fix it, one would think it should be an easy fix, but apparently Lyft staff is set on being morons. One week after being told I was basically $#*! out of luck they stopped replying to my emails altogether, I tried calling them but after being on hold for 2 hours I gave up. My girlfriend used Lyft on a daily basis but after this experience we're moving on to Uber and never looking back. I didn't even want my money back for what is over $200 in charges. I just wanted this fixed, but Lyft clearly doesn't give a rat's ass about their consumers.",1,lyft.com
855,"Lyft is refusing to honor the $750 signup bonus. The reason I chose Lyft over Uber is because they were offering this bonus for DC drivers. I googled Lyft and saw that they were offering it. I then decided to download the app and start the signup process. I signed up and got on the road only to later be told that I needed to input a code when signing up and that they will not input it for me. Lyft did not properly advertise this bonus or any bonus for that matter. Lyft doesn't say you need to input the code. What happens to many people is that they do their research (like I did), see the benefits and then proceed to download the app or apply to be a driver through the app they already have downloaded. In my case at least, it was reasonable to assume that the bonus was for all DC drivers who signed up (given what you can see on Lyft's website) and consequently I signed up in DC. Later I was told that I needed to input the code when signing up and that they will not be honoring the signup bonus.

I had no problems taking my dog in the car. The drivers are always so nice saying my dog is so cute and they never seen anything like him. And pet him. BUT today on 1/26/17 I decided to take my dog to the park. I opened up the app & the driver was on the way. I was waiting for almost 10 mins then he cancelled my ride. Then another driver got called he was on his way already. He came & picked up my small dog! (I always put my dog on my lap btw) he asked if it it was a service dog & im like no. & very very rudely he didn't want to take me & said ""nahh I'm not gonna take you "" in the most rude & disgusting tone ever. He didn't even said sorry. He drove off very quickly. I couldn't believe it. This wasted almost an hour of my time. I always thought lyft was pet friendly till this happened. He was very very mean.

860,"My first experience with Lyft was deeply upsetting and disappointing. I realized I only had one glove as soon as my daughter and I closed the car door on a Friday evening in Brooklyn. She chased the driver down the street but was unable to flag him down. I immediately went to the app but was unable to do anything except rate and tip the driver, which I did (5 stars, $5) immediately so that I could get to the screen where I could contact him about my glove. I learned I was unable to call him; when I tried to submit the lost item form, it wouldnt go through. So I had to go back to customer support and do it there. While I got email confirmation, I did not get a call from the driver until Saturday afternoon. He was rude on the phone, stated he did not have my glove, and only after my pleading with him several times did he agree to look once more and then call me back. He did not call me back. I sent Lyft customer support screen shots showing when the driver called me and showing that he only called once. I attached a copy of the receipt for the gloves ($65 + tax), which were bought the night before the trip when I learned how cold it was going to be. After several rounds of back and forth, customer support remained adamant that they would not do one thing to rectify the problem. Im in utter disbelief at how this situation with a first-time customer was handled and that there was no effort to correct the cascade of problems that occurred that night, from the drivers unacceptable delay in response (which, had this delay not occurred, the whole problem would not have happened) to the app (which had a broken link) to the drivers rudeness and lack of a promised follow-up phone call, to the customer service response (which was to offer me absolutely nothingnot the replacement cost of the item, which isnt even that much compared to a lost phone, for example; not a refund for the ride; not even a credit toward a future ride). Im someone who really loves writing positive reviews for great experiences with businesses; it makes me feel good. This whole experience made me feel bad.

862,"To all of the complaints from people who applied to Drive for Lyft & Uber, You are LUCKY you didn't get hired! Lyft is so not worth it! Yes, you can get a car through their leasing program but you will not make any money!! Take it from a year and a half driver of these companies! I am actually going through a nightmare right now with Lyft's leased car! My personal car a week prior to New Years Eve lost its brakes. This forced me to lease a Lyft vehicle until my car was repaired. Three days before New Years Eve, my personal was fixed. I contacted Lyft to give them back their car. They wouldn't respond to my email. I wanted to give them back their car and have them take the Express Driver Rental platform off and put the regular driver platform back on where I am making my bonuses and express pay again. When a driver is leasing a Lyft car, Lyft puts a hold on your pay. You will not get any bonuses, you can not Express pay yourself where you would get your money with in a few minutes. Lyft will charge you 200 dollars. Plus the tax fees. Plus the Lyft fees, and require you to drive a minimum of 75 pickups which they control. It's a scam and it is not worth it! Lyft refused to take the car back before New Years Eve leaving me without being able to earn money. I ended up jumping on the Uber app and didn't make hardly anything! Lyft New that if I was stuck with the car that I would have to pay for it. I haven't signed on with them for a week. I haven't touched their car in over a week. And they tell me it doesn't matter because I still have the car even though it was them that refused to take the car back. It's a money making scam leaving you in debt with a company that is suppose to provide a pay check! I gave a year in a half of my life to them. Ran two brand new cars into the hole. One car is only 9 months old and looks like it's 3 years old!! I started out with 1 mile on the car and as of today it has 30,000 miles on the odometer! I am a 5.0 star rated driver with over 5234 passengers serviced for Lyft. All I have to show for my hard work and dedication to this company is two cars run into the ground, more debt and unable to pay those debts then when I first started with them. Customers who have no respect or regard for the drivers property and feel they are deserving of only paying $5 fees but want a $80,000 car and a silver spoon to eat a pint of gold! Lyft is in trouble! They have been trying to sell their company to Apple, Uber, Google, and others who have turned them down and away!

Today however was my boiling point when a Lyft driver not only submitted a false claim against me stating I had damaged her car, but also had the nerve to charge 50$ to my card for it. Luckily I called fraud and had my card turned off before they could take the money out. Lyft first took out a 27$ damage fee charge when this driver falsely claimed that I had not strapped my 18 month old into a car seat. This false claim came two hours after she had dropped me off and I immediately called Lyft and sent pictures, in which my 27$ was refunded albeit with a ridiculous warning on how Lyft is a family friendly service and car safety. Four hours later, I received a damage vehicle bill from this exact driver who I had complained out for 50$ along with pictures of what appeared to be a staged damage back seat full of littered trash bags, crumpled up paper towels, a box of arm and hammer and a pack of plastic cups. At first, I had believed that the complaint was about how my infant son had thrown up on me and himself and how I had cleaned up what little spot there was on the back seat using a car wipe given to me by the driver. But no, apparently this picture that was so obviously staged by the driver I'm guessing for my earlier complain was what was being issued. Even when I told the representative that I had a witness who was with me in the back seat when this happened who could back up my story, Lyft representatives still stated that they had to go by what the driver said had happened in her records (which was taken four hours after dropping me off at my destination) and by her pictures (which was taken also by that same time due to the time stamp). I disabled my account and blocked Lyft from making anymore charges.

I've asked three different times for the information of these three different transactions and they will not give me the information I have requested.

It would be more comforting to know if this was just a random hack or if it was someone I know considering my card is still in my possession.

I called several locations and was told I needed to come in to speak to a rep from the company. I could get no further information.  When I arrived at the downtown Hertz agency. As soon as I approached the door someone informed me that Lyft was done for the day and had been since 12 noon. This was a surprise to me since I had called around 2 o'clock and was told to come in. They informed me that only about 12 cars a day would be rented and that you needed to come in everyday at around 6am to have a chance at getting a car even though the lyft staff doesn't arrive until 11am.

872,"After taking a Lyft ride, I was sent an email the following day that said our driver specifically identified me as the requesting passenger for a ride during which damage was incurred. They sent two pictures of the interior back seat as proof of damage. However, in reviewing the pictures, I can't identify what ""damage"" they say occurred and they state a fee for damage is $150? The email further says from the time our ride ended to the time Lyft was notified of damage was 4 seconds? So the driver dropped us off and filed a damage complaint with Lyft in 4 seconds flat... Also, after extracting the data from the provided photos, I discovered that they were taken the night following our ride (nearly 22 hours after our ride ended). Nobody in the vehicle damaged his car, so obviously I disputed the claim.  I informed Lyft of the photos being taken a day after our ride ended and supplied them with the extracted data info. I also asked for specific information on what damage was being alleged. Lyft sent a series of generic emails without answering any questions or acknowledging the photos were taken well after our ride ended. They said they had ""anecdotal"" evidence and ""reserves the right (but is not obligated) to verify or otherwise require documentation of damages prior to processing a damage fee."" So basically what I gather from this, is that Lyft does not need proof nor cares if there is proof to substantiate a claim of damage. If your driver doesn't care for you or just needs some extra cash, they (driver) simply says you damaged their vehicle and you get railroaded with a fraudulent charge. If I, or my group, damages a drivers vehicle, I'll gladly pay up and apologize. There was no damage done by our group nor is there ANY proof to show our group damaged his vehicle.  When you sign up for Lyft carefully review the ""damage fee"" section of their terms. As indicated above, it basically says you agree to pay a fee of up to $250 - Lyft ""in its sole discretion"" determines the amount to be charged and does not need to verify or require documentation of damage. Needless to say, they definitely lost me as a customer and I will warn any friends or family to avoid Lyft!!

During the initial conversation, then at the actual turn. At the turn I told him to take, he almost drove past it. This dude slowed down approaching GREEN lights, waiting for them to turn yellow and stop. Basically every single chance he had to make it longer, he used.  Then, we get to my gate. He acts like he's never had to enter a gate. Pulled way far away from the keypad, slowly drove back and forth, to get to it, instead of getting out like he should have.  Asked the code, kept saying it back incorrectly. Every exchange between us he raised his voice, things escalated in volume quickly in our dialogue.  FINALLY we got in. I said, stop here and let me out. He stopped. The door was locked, and he would not unlock the door to let me out. No conversation. Then he drives around even more until HE decided he would let me out. That MF.

I suggest, my friends, to avoid this company. Hi Eliani, Thank you for your response. All charges on the Lyft platform are non-refundable, as outlined in our Terms of Service and Help Center.

893,One driver name Angelo his a thief he pick me up at work trop me at home that is only 10 miles what he did he change the whole address so he can over charge my account from $7.75 to $23.77 that's a lot lyft customer service very poor,1,lyft.com
894,So my cc has a $50 hold because 2 Lyft drivers failed to pick me up on my vacation. I requested one driver and he couldn't find my villa so he claimed to drive to my vacation villa but I was outside the whole time waiting and no driver showed up. The other driver just failed completely and didnt even try to find my villa he stared 8 minutes away and proceeded to go further and further away. Plus they never answered the phone calls so I couldn't give them specific directions because I am staying in a resort. So now I have a $50 hold on my cc and I won't see that money till after my vacation. Good job Lyft for failing. This would of never happened with uber. Oh wait it didn't those drivers were able to communicate and find my villa without a problem. So stay away from Lyft they'll hold your money even if it is their fault.,1,lyft.com
895,"I applied to become a driver with Lyft in Rocklin, CA and completed my appointment with my mentor. She was nice and took my picture and then said all that was left was the background check that would take anywhere from 2 days to 2 weeks. Not even 24 hours later, I got an email saying my application was denied. When I contacted my mentor I could not reach her and was told by Lyft that the mentor appointment is the ""make or break moment"" and they would not reverse their decision. They also said they could not disclose why it was denied nor could they connect me to a live representative due to safety for drivers and passengers. I will not be recommending Lyft to drivers or passengers and see the process as a complete waste of time.",1,lyft.com

Had to cancel card and get new account. CC theft complaints seem common for both companies. Drivers are allowed to drive for both companies at the same time.

I couldn't even check to see if a car was available until I had entered my card number, there was nobody available. I never even requested a car, because nobody was available yet they are holding my $25.

904,"I would not recommend this service for the following reasons; Lyft automatically place a $25 hold on your account upon signing up. That hold will tie up your funds for about 7 days. subsequently they place the $25 hold on your account whenever you login to the app rather you request a ride or not. Again the hold will tie up your funds for about 7 days. When you have an issue with their service and use the ""help"" options you will get a general automated response and that's it. No one will call you no one will respond via email. So they essentially take your money and don't respond to your request for review of the charges. I downloaded the app and once I found out about the holds I deleted the app. Months later I started to get emails urging me to use a free ride before it expired. On the last day for the free ride to expire, they posted charges to my card totaling $75.. When I requested a review and refund...crickets!!!

909,"Summary: Use all their first-time rider coupons and then go with UBER!!! I've been using Lyft for three weeks now (mainly to get to work during the cold weather) and I'm sad to report that everyday has been an ordeal using Lyft!!! Uber is soooo much better and the drivers seem more knowledgeable in terms of street smarts and navigation. Here is a summary of the problems I've encountered with LYFT: 1) Drivers, while nice, are not great drivers and cannot navigate (even with a GPS). I had one driver turn from a middle lane and otherwise drive awfully, one driver who didn't even know where SE was and another driver who didn't even know what the difference was between car pool and single passenger service (I HAD TO EXPLAIN IT TO HIM!) 2) Car pool sucks! I tried car pool and first, it takes 10 minutes for them to pick you up and then they drove (in my case, about 4-5 miles out of my way in the opposite direction) to pick up the other person (who was late!!!) and then drops her off in (I'm going to SE - could she be even further out of my way?!??). Then the driver doesn't know how to use the Lyft app and ends up driving us back to the office building in Georgetown (where the other girl got off) as our ""next stop."" When I told him that my address was in SE, he didn't know how to use his own GPS. He kept turning on PA Avenue rather than K Street. We ended looped around the same block THREE TIMES (during rush hour traffic, pedestrians and lights adding over 15 minutes to my trip) before he finally listened to me that he was making the wrong turn each time! My otherwise 15 minute commute to work took over 55 minutes!!! 3) One morning, the driver's ETA was ""2 minutes."" Well AFTER 8 MINUTES, I could see on my app that the driver NEVER MOVED the car and NO PROGRESS was made to come to my home. YET the app still said she was ""2 minutes away."" I cancelled my ride because at this point I was late to work and they had the audacity to charge me a $5 cancellation fee when their own software could have told them that their driver NEVER moved her car to even try and pick me up! 4) The way they apply credits towards rides is a total rip off. In short, I had a few credits on my account. One $10 credit expiring tomorrow and one $20 credit (for referring a friend to Lyft - BIG MISTAKE) that expired a month from now. Well the geniuses at Lyft and their app, used my $20 credit this morning for a $12 trip instead of applying the $10 credit that EXPIRES TOMORROW even though there is nothing in their policies explaining the logic and method for applying credit.  After multiple backs and forth with Lyft, telling them that their app was faulty, irrational and defies commonsense, they refuse to return my $20 credit. Basically, now I'm stuck with a credit that expires in less than 14 hours while they wasted my $20 credit for a $12 trip (so I lose $8 in credit). STUPID!!!! I HATE LYFT!!!!!! I hope this sub-par company is finished off by UBER!",1,lyft.com
910,"The driver failed to show up, then Lyft texted me that I had missed the ride, but because it was a ""free ride,"" Lyft would not charge me! IDIOTS! How does this horrible company survive?

911,"I used Lyft 3 times. The first 2 times were fine. The third time, last night January 8, 2016, I requested a lift at 1pm after a dinner party on my way home from the airport. From a popular restaurant in a city of over 100,000 population, the fastest response time was 15 minutes. However, the first driver who accepted my request, Jennifer, never showed after 15 minutes and would not respond to calls or texts. The second driver, Darin, did the same thing. So, the restaurant closed and I was left out in the wind and rain. I found an overhang but the wind was so bad I still got drenched. After nearly an hour of no-shows, I called a conventional taxi. Had they just replied ""no drivers available"" I would not have nearly frozen. Here is where i gets really bad: the next day I tried to delete my account and credit card and there is no way to do that. It's been over 6 hours since I contacted support via email with no response. To add insult to injury 11 hours later a driver responded and said ""I'm on my way"" when I hit the cancel ride button I soon got a $5 cancellation receipt....11 hours after I requested the ride??? Consumers should know that while this service may be okay during working/peak hours, however Lyft is totally unreliable in situations such as emergencies or to avoid driving after drinking...situations when you really need a ride. Who accepts a fair then just leaves the customer standing in the rain without the courtesy of a text??? Evidently this is a common thing with Lyft. I would not recommend this service to anyone.

Well about 7 minutes later I closed my tab thinking the driver would be there soon. WRONG I opened the app again to see how far away the driver was and it still said 13 minutes. So I continued to wait and wait and WAIT for about 30-45 minutes. Finally I canceled the ride and requested a new one, right away that driver declined me. I request ANOTHER ride and waited 5 minutes before canceling that ride. Anytime my debit card is used without being swiped (bills automatically being taken out things of that nature) I'm notified that it is being used and I got an email that lyft charged me $25. I googled to see if they had a customer service number, called it, and the number is a machine telling you to file a complaint online. Can we say how convenient that is for them that they don't actually have to hear people complain. So I did that and got an email back saying that they took a look at my account and I'm not being charged and gave me a credit to use for a ride and told me that the time they give is an estimate. Which I understand but if the drive is going to be over 30 minutes late from the ""estimated time"" they should contact you and let you know. Low and behold I check my account the next day my account is pending a $25 charge from lyft. All of this trying to get a free ride (up to $5) was NOT worth it.

928,"I tried Lyft for 45 days in Boston and I found most of their marketing promises of bonuses, referral payouts to be misleading and buried in a mountain of fine prints. Getting 8 to 10 dollars for rides is not worth doing. There is low demand in the service is the suburbs and even in the Boston Downtown area you will find yourself driving in circles and riders canceling last minute.  I did not like driving for Lyft for couple of reasons: 1- They refused to deliver the sign up bonus they promised when I signed up, even though I met all the requirements and their pretext was I did not use a referral code from another driver which was easy for me to do but did not want to reward a random driver who did not referral me to Lyft. There are plenty of people who list their codes online. Lyft failed to make that clear during the sign-up. 2- While I loved the application, Lyft has a low demand in the area and you will be driving for hours fishing for riders, they won't give you an exact location of the demand. Instead, a whole city may go red but you won't know where the riders are until you are within a small distance of them. While the application has the option for tips, your riders won't tip no matter how nice you are to them. So to drive in Boston area and deal with traffic, stop and go and riders not tipping, you will be driving for gas money and nothing else. This ride-sharing idea will not make you a lot of money if you live in Boston MA, because of the cost of living. It will be nice if Lyft delivered on their bonuses but often this is the case of the horse and the carrot. They lure you in with these bonuses just to find out that they are impossible to get or have a ton of fine prints behind them.

I advised him to wait until I could check them out. Today I went to the site. https://www.lyft.com/drive/helparticle.1227562. I found no customer service number at all on this site.

I then asked the representative about why there is no customer service for lyft if there was a problem with any payments that may not be made or if someone cancelled payment for a ride they received? She advised me that it all would be have to be done via e-mail. I looked up some reviews on the level of customer satisfaction. Here is one of them. We took Lyft from Venice Beach to Studio City LA. The ride there cost us $17 with Uber. The ride back with Lyft cost us $45. The driver pretended like he didn't know the area to wrack up the bill.

Not only did the first driver yell at me that I must have done something wrong, but that I was supposed to find this Mobil station and meet him there. When I told him that he'd have to come and get me, he said he didn't know what the Transit Center was or where Old Town San Diego was - which is kind of like a NYC taxi driver not knowing what Madison Square Garden was or where Times Square was!! The second driver ""missed the exit"" off the freeway, circled around, then ""missed the turn"" - again and again and again. After watching this idiots time to pickup drop down from 4 minutes to 1, then go up to 7, back to 2, then up to 5, then back to 1 that up to 11, I just canceled his ride also and took a taxi.

938,"I was recently in a car accident and am without transportation. I just started a new job and the company has a very strict late policy. I was told about Lyft and Uber and decided to give it a whirl. After looking at reviews online, I saw a lot of people favored Lyft over Uber, so I went with it. The first downside, you cannot schedule in advance, so you are expected to call for your ride a little before you need the ride. I tried two days in a row to contact a driver and had no success ( they were all busy). Well that sucks, considering I still need to get to work. A few days later I request a driver, about 45 min before I needed to be to work, ( which is only 7 min from where I live.). I requested the driver, because the system said it was only 12 min away. Once I clicked the confirm button, I find out it's 17 min away. Then a few min later, the driver Jerome called and introduced himself, to my relief he said he was only 5 miles away and would be there. I waited, and waited and waited... over 50 min later, he still wasn't there and his phone would go right to voicemail when I would try to call. Needless to say, I wasn't going to make it to work on time! I ended up cancelling the ride, I sure hope they don't charge me for it. Of course, I tried to call customer service while all of this was going on , and what do you know, they're aren't any live representative options. They refer you to go back to the website! This company sucks, I would never ever even think about ever using it again!!! I only gave it a 1, because I had to! Wallingford, Pa.",1,lyft.com

940,A ride I take everyday to and from work that cost me 7 and some change with uber cost me 10 40 with lyft going the same route I will just stick with uber,1,lyft.com
941,"I am in disbelief on how terribly this company is run. I was given a card that said I could get a free $20 ride for my first ride so I used that promo code. Later on I was texted that I had 3 free $15 rides, so I got another ride that night. I was charged for both of those rides and when I filed a complaint I didn't get a response for days (I've dealt with uber a lot and they've never taken more than 12 hours to respond no matter day or time). When they finally did respond, the were 100% unhelpful by claiming that my free $20 ride offer was expired (despite no expiration date on the card) and that those 3 $15 rides were actually $5 per ride which was completely deceptive because what the text literally said was ""we've added 3 free ($15) rides to your account"". I know I deserve my money back but this company refuses to even communicate with me. Both my friend and I had to blow up their facebook page to get their attention at all and still all I've gotten is a vague ""we'll look into it and get back to you"" and of course no one has gotten back to me. It has now been a week. This company is a joke and deserves to go out of business, please don't do yourself the disservice of using them.",1,lyft.com
942,"I signed up to be a driver in hoped of getting a $1,000 bonus. I applied minutes after receiving the invitation, and I was able to log into the system as a driver and was approved hours to drive on the afternoon of March 5th. Mysteriously I was not ""approved"" to drive until the 7th, got a welcome email, picked up my first ride. Minutes later the email came through that I didn't qualify for the promo. Of course, they never intended to pay. It was all a sham. I will not deal with such a company that would stoop to this level. They know background checks take time and organized this whole thing so they would pay very few drivers. I will stick to Uber, who can keep a promise!!!",1,lyft.com

First, the credits expired within a few weeks which is fine but who would ever take that many rides in 2.5 weeks. False advertising if you ask me. But anyway, I used the service and they charge your account $25 dollars in a pre-activation fee to make sure my card is legitimate. They did it for every ""free"" ride I took. In one night I had $75 worth of pending charges on my account to cover three $5 rides. It's been several days now and the charges have not been cleared off. Now I have to worry if my payments will go through on that card and not knowing when the money will be free to use. I'm a student, $75 is a lot to hold in my account. Ill never use lyft again.",1,lyft.com

I worked for that company one WEEK only and they fired me for 0.1 point of rating below their standard rating. In the meantime, I received an email from them confirming that I was deactivated for the age of my car. Based on this email, I got a car loan and bought a $10,000 car. However, they refused to reactivate me and acted as if they never sent me anything. Screw their app! They are nothing but an opportunistic and exploitative company!",1,lyft.com

948,"I would love it if Lyft were successful, because I think competition is good. Problem is, I think they will fail as Uber provides a much higher level of customer service and is far more professional. Lyft has many issues, but one of them is their 'Primetime' pricing which is calculated in a much more customer unfriendly way than Uber. As an example, if Uber says 'Surge pricing' is 150% it means that if the normal rate is $10, you will pay $15. That makes sense to me. With Lyft, when they say 'Primetime pricing' is 150%, it means that if the normal rate is $10, you will pay $25, that is, nearly double what you would pay on Uber. And in my market, UberX is 20% cheaper than Lyft to begin with. Add in all the attitude with Lyft (fist bumps, I am supposed to be friends with my driver) -- higher prices for an inferior product. Finally, customer service at Lyft is surly and basically non-existent.",1,lyft.com
949,"Firstly there is the service. One day you might get a ride with someone who speaks the same language as you and is driving a clean vehicle that isn't dented, rusting or doesn't stink like the 9th circle of hell inside but that will be a RARE day if you ever do. Secondly, If you find yourself outside of their preferred pick up areas, you are not going to get a ride or you will wait longer than you wold have for a taxi or legal rideshare. Third, THERE IS NO INSURANCE. Lyft is falsely advertising that they actually have insurance, their TOS page invalidates any and all coverage for you once you get in the vehicle. Fourth, their surge pricing scam is obviously NOT about a lack of supply or demand or they wouldn't be dropping the surge price once a few of their drivers have picked up people at THREE times the normal rate in the same area. It is a method of keeping their vehicles in one area so Uber can collect more fees from their drivers. It has nothing to do with customer service or actual demand and it destroys the green factor of the service as it puts twice as many vehicles on the road than would be needed. This isn't even a real rideshare company. It is just a crappy point to point service. If you do not care about your own safety or the safety of those you travel with or the planet, this is the service for you.",1,lyft.com

My normal fare for this particular route is normally $40-45 LYFT charged me $71 almost double. UBER has great customer service whenever you contact them the respond within 24 hours. I cannot say the same for LYFT they have yet to address the issue of them overcharging me for the ride. I spoke to some other people i know and they've had similar issue with LYFT. LYFT is a SCAM & they need to be addressed about their bad business practices.,1,lyft.com

They tell you: ""they have enough qualified drivers"", but yet they harass you, by texting and emailing you; asking you to join their team (because they don't know what the hell they are doing!). Total contradiction.  They are a very very stupid ride sharing company. I hate that their stupid pink mustache.

I had a job interview and no other way to get to it so I had to pay. On the way back, luckily I wasn't forced to pay extra, but my bill for two 20 min rides was over $40. The third trip I planned on taking told me I had to pay 100% more to ""encourage people to drive"". That is absolutely insane! I am a college student! This trip was 30 min drive both ways meaning, plus the 100% extra, the trip would be over $80! I would rather walk both ways! I understand it can be busy, but not even telling me how much the trip should about cost and then forcing me to pay so much extra is horrific!",1,lyft.com
954,"Tonight my daughter was abandoned by Lyft. Three times her ride was cancelled. The fourth message she received stated that her ride cost would increase by 200%!!! She was in a completely unfamiliar town. She took Lyft there, so it was completely appropriate to think she wouldn't have a problem to return home. She went back into the venue and was informed of a train departing in 22 minutes, the last one of the night, but she was 20 minutes away. She ran there only to find that was bad information...the last train had already left. My now hysterical daughter called me...frantic, not knowing how she'd get home. Thankfully she found a cab who charged her $100 for a 25 minute drive to the train station. I'm hundreds of miles away, waiting to hear she has safely returned home. What a disgrace.

I was wondering why and called them and talked to a person finally because its is hard to get hold of any person if you have any questions, which is bad service I would say and I told them I am a driver and have a Airport badge to work at Airport but who cares no proper answer, Still waiting for their answer. Then I applied in Uber X my background was fine, I was wondering what's wrong with these people. I wasted my time I would suggest you please don't waste you time lyft.

The driver took the next exit so that he could turnaround to go back to where he picked me up so that he could pick up the added rider. Here's what I don't get about Lyft, why would you add a rider that will require the driver to change his direction, like in my case, required the driver to turn-around and head back in the direction opposite from where we were heading? We were already 15 minutes in route and the driver had to turn-around and go back to where he picked me up just to add another rider. Is it not possible to only add riders who are heading in the same direction that the driver is in route to?

I lifted the bags and packed the car and did not talk the entire way which is not like me. We arrived at the destination and I then proceeded to get the kids out of the car. The driver dumped the bags at the bottom of my drive and drove away promptly without saying a word. I could certainly tell yet again that this journey had been time consuming for him!  A day later I then received an email advising me that I had shut the seatbelt in the car which I know for a fact I did not do. Lyft then without calling or asking my side of the story proceeded to quote the terms and condition and removed $50 from my credit card on file which I told them not to without further enquiry.

It seems that every time I request a car, my bank account associated with the debit card I registered with Lyft, gets a $25 ""Authorization Hold"" put on. I was told it was a one time thing. Now EVERY TIME I request a car, there's a new hold. I email them an get a computer generated apology stating it for all new accounts. But over been using them for months. There is no number to call them unless there is an emergency to report. #Lyft sucks!!!  They don't have to worry about me requesting a car any more.

973,"The actual Lyft service is convenient and somewhat reliable (I'd give the actual service a 4). However, I was erroneously charged 3 times for a single ride and then I realized how terrible Lyft's customer service is. They are the only company I have encountered that doesn't have a phone number for basic customer service issues. They instead force you to go through emails, which they essentially completely ignore. EVEN COMCAST HAS A PHONE NUMBER (granted that phone number is one of the more useless phone numbers in existence). Simply put, a business can't operate in this fashion and, unless they change things, they are going to always lose to Uber. I had been using Lyft very consistently for months before the charges happened. I will now never use it again. I hope some other people see these reviews and figure this out before something shady happens to them (for some reason I assumed Lyft had great customer service before I actually had to deal with it). Lastly, their website tells you, if you see charges you don't think are correct, NOT to dispute the charge with your bank before they get a chance to figure it out. This request is both strange and ridiculous; its strange because Ive never encountered this stance from a company before (they go as far as to tell you to withdraw your dispute if you already filed one) and its ridiculous because they ask you to not dispute it while simultaneously having absolutely nonexistent customer service.

The ones that piss me off are the driver that cancels your ride. Ive had a few drivers cancel me stating, that I never came out for the pick up. This was totally false. I suggest that you screenshot every move especially when they are close to your pick up location. Remember theres a blue circle that shows your exact location on the Lyft tracking map. I have been taking pics of all of this for anyone that want to play games. I also send text and call the driver to make sure that theres no discrepancies about my location. I do understand that they are not suppose to text and drive; however, the directions for my pick me up is ALWAYS very detailed. Im ready to send pics to plead my case for anyone that would like to try me. My other gripe with Lyft is not having a direct line to speak with a representative about issues like this! This is the biggest problem that I have with this company. Overall, I have had more good experiences than bad ones. Ive never had to wait too long for a ride.

981,I drive for Lyft and now they keep telling people that you can make up to 1500 that a joke with the 3.50 fares that they chrage and so many people who think that I can drive to but don't know how to get around town without GPS and the people you pick up out here anymore in phoenix area are cheap and don't tip and don't want to go any further than 1-3 miles away and waste your time and gas to pick them up about 40% tip and 60% don't tip and expect alot from the driver and have no respect for the driver think because they are a big spender and pay 4-5 dallors they can run the mouth to you or after the transaction is done by talking $#*! about the driver to try to get free rides from the company and its been slow down since the think that college kids are doing it it's a totally joke to they are cheap and broke and lazy to call for a ride for a short walk away and lots of the ride are getting longer to pick up then drop off the person Lyft has mess up the app sending the driver call 20 30 minutes away and you can't see were the person want to go until you get there now and wonder why the person don't get picked up last year shows that were the person want to go and chrage more money for the fare and wonder why the driver are not going out any more or will not pick up the person it used to be fast and easy to pick up the person but it not getting to the point where it's become a real problem in the Phoenix area cheap rides bad passenger in some cases and no tips and people tell you I'll put it in the fare and don't people want to go to the store and get picked up from the store waste your time and gas for 2.80 you get and are rude and cheap people who don't tip the driver only time you can make any money is in prime time now since most of the big spender don't tip and wait time is a joke 5 minutes and if they are not going any were you don't get paid for the wait time to used to but not any more and they are trying to scam the driver on the taxes send people taxes form who don't get them and if you do get one they are added the 20% on the tax forms so they don't have to pay the tax to the irs to so it's only a seasonal job to not going to make money in the summer mouth here it's become less and less money to make in Arizona to since the people with money are not coming out here anymore to Arizona about 10% from years past college kids are not going to work they are cheap and don't tip out here so I just want you to know that it's a good thing to do if you know the areas and don't need GPS to do the job the picture of the person smile on the ad if you're making great money you will be but remember that it's still a job your use your own vehicle and insurance and repair and maintenance and gas to do thris they only pay you 80% of the fare and if you're not getting good fares and make good money it's not worth it so I think really hard about doing this if you not serious about making money and because you have a car does not mean you can do this must be very good at the street and town to get around fast enough to find the person and drop them off don't have to speed around just know what your doing to the rideshare in Arizona are getting to be a joke now just remember that you will be paying for everything before to and they don't care about you ever you don't work for Lyft they work for you since they tell you that your not an employee of the company in anyway but remember that the star system is a scam to get money from people to only good thing from the star system is to get rid of bad passenger so good luck if you don't have experience doing cab work courier work and know that only pick up people who are with in 5-10 minutes max lost of cancel the ride and waste your time and gas to try to pick them up it better than most places to work but if you think the Phoenix area is paying 1500 a week that a joke to the price should go up to but they only cares about the money they make so if you don't know how to play the game with the cab business don't waste your time your not going to make any money,3,lyft.com
982,"Besides the occasional extensive wait times(last week it occured to me for the first time to wait almost 2 hours at LAX for a ping) and then i got a ride going to Brentwood.. Driving for lyft, passangers and overall experience is great. However, when you have an issue the customer service is the worst thing ever!! It makes me so mad that their customer service is o bad. The other day i drove until I reached $100(gross amount) and out of those $100 i only had $39 available to cash out and when i saw that i got pissed! I didnt know(btw still dont know) what was going on. I may have cashed part of the money maybe but i really couldnt remember and had(have) the feeling that i was being stolen from.. i contacted lyft SO MANY TIMES explaining with most detail as possible, i took screen shots and wrote on the pics, and the answers i got kept on being generic answers that were seriously annoying! I spent time trying to make it as clear as possible and the representatives didn't give a $#*!, they barely read my email.... Here is one of the responses: ""With Express Pay, you can collect earnings on a debit card whenever youve earned at least $50, after the Lyft fee. Ride earnings, referral bonuses and mentor payments are included in Express Pay."" Basically all their responses say the same thing, no one bothered to look into my account to explain to me where the money went and why I had only $39 available out of $100 when it should be around $75.  After i got my sign up driver bonus and ran into this simple issue that LYFT clearly doesnt give a $#*! about, I'm considering Uber again (Politics aside). It's really frustrating... Well thanks for reading",3,lyft.com
983,I have trying to sign up as a driver for over one month. They tell me what I need to do to fix the problem but their instructions do not work. I have restarted my pc several times and also tried from other pc's to no avail. I have asked numerous times for a phone call but they will not call. I have already paid for my vehicle inspection. I am seriously disappointed with this company!!,4,lyft.com
984,I have been charged twice for rides that I haven't taken and I can't even speak to someone regarding this matter. Who is going to refund me back my money before i end up pressing charges,4,lyft.com
985,Prefer Lyft to Uber. The prices are usually near the same.I like that I can tip the drivers for Lyft on the card.I've had some fun Lyft rides.,4,lyft.com
986,I signed up today and I didn't have to submit any credit card information at all so I don't know what everyone is saying about a charge.,4,lyft.com
987,"I recently tried Lyft and found that it was quite a bit more affordable than taking a cab. Usually I take the subway, but for those late nights it's a nice alternative to the subterranean schlep. The drivers are always friendly, and you don't have to deal with any of the usual disruptions of a pleasant ride such as chemical smells covering up the stench of last night's frat boy puke, no over-bearing cheap cologne, and no annoying forced commercials. If you have time to wait for a ride it's a far better experience and for a fraction of the price.",4,lyft.com
988,Lyft app requests drivers when I am NOT requesting one. I was just dropped off at the airport and unbeknownst to me another driver was requested. When he called I clarified that I did not request the ride. He cancelled. Then your app automatically requested another driver which I did not need again. Lot of confusion. On the brighter side most of the drivers are exceptionally nice.,4,lyft.com
989,"I drive for lyft and the reason I came to lyft is because of the tip option available for riders to click on at the end of the ride to be included on the driver's paycheck. I always drive safely and provide the options of going a bit slower or a bit faster depending on my rider's schedule, I always give the option to stop me at anytime if you need to get something from the store or anything else. I have a 4.96 star overall rating to this date and sometimes my week ends near a 4.98 rating, I have nothing against anyone but it is dissappointing when you realize that the majority of riders don't tip, living in a city where rent is at an all time high and only keeps getting more expensive to live in. Your favorite restaurants/bar service people live based on their tips, isn't it time to stop and think for a moment and think how would you make a living out of the same thing I do, day in and day out and dealing with many intoxicated people that bring my rating down from times even though I babysit them and make sure they make it all the way in their home/apt. Please tip your driver's if he takes good care of you. Plus in the washington dc area per an email I just got it better for riders, since you will be saving 50% off rides during the week not weekends, can you find it somewhere in your heart to tip since you'll be saving more compared to uber, please. :-) I tip all my service people when I am out and about. I used to be a barback, clerk at a lawfirm, and it is just the right thing to do. Uber drivers now rate their customers 4 stars when they dont tip",4,lyft.com
990,"Worked well for me when I was in San Francisco about a year ago, I'd definitely recommend it in the city. Drivers were interesting and rides were cheap!",4,lyft.com
991,"pretty good but they are like the downgraded version of uber, cars are a little bit more old and you can tell that they are still figuring it out. I would travel in pairs as it the drivers can be somewhat weird. not bad on pricing, good if you can't get a taxi.",4,lyft.com
992,"Lytf is a new kind of taxi service where a regular person in their car (usually adorned with a giant pink mustache on the grill) picks you up and gives you a ride somewhere and then you give a ""donation"". It works through an app on your phone. The app is only so-so designed; as of the writing of this review it requires Facebook to sign in. And the map thing is a bit finicky. In my experience it is a little bit cheaper than a regular taxi, but there aren't always drivers available. But the idea is good and hopefully will bring down taxi fares. It also seems like a reasonable way to make some extra money driving people around if you have some free time and don't mind driving around strangers. I should also mention there is a review system for drivers AND passengers so it puts some pressure on people to be nice.",4,lyft.com
993,There are few times in life where a complete stranger can touch your heart and win you over in just one sitting. Today I was lucky to have such an experience...AND A LYFT DRIVER AT MY SURPRISE! I ask myself how is it possible to undergo a Qualifying Life Event (QLE) in a matter of minutes? Maybe it was her comforting smile upon arrival that seemed to calm my anxiousness from running late. Maybe it was her radiating spirit that magically kept my two five year olds in a trance. Or just maybe it was her compassion exhibited when I reported my sudden emergency that prevented me from proceeding to my final destination. These things could very well be variables at question but it is factual that in unfavorable moments life throws us curve balls and even passing figures have the ability to leave their mark. Deirdre S. (RKW7650) this review could never be good enough. You are truly a prize.,5,lyft.com
994,I've been using Lyft for years. I can say that 90% of my experiencr with them has been positive. Nice drivers and pretty good company. Will continue using the service.,5,lyft.com
995,"they made it right though and I am happy and that is the only momentary issue we have ever had, better prices than Uber too. Can be quite a bit cheaper than Uber actually.",5,lyft.com
996,"Has lyft received complaints from their driver that their app was not working properly.Rides being canceled while they were driving the person who's ride was canceled on the app. App saying no service in area? App freezing and so on,meaning losing rides and money because their app not working?",5,lyft.com
997,"Lyft is a great. The drivers are friendly, the rates are great and the support team is awesome. Although it's my responsible for making sure I have all of my things when I exit the vehicle, on several occasions I have left things in the car and my Lyft driver always returns them to me. As we know, technology can be flakey, but when there are occasional gps or app issues, the drivers confidently work around those. Yea, there is an authorization hols on your cc, but Lyft let's you know that upfront. Promo codes usually work well as long as they aren't expired. I love Lyfts love of community. Great job guys.",5,lyft.com
998,"I absolutely love Lyft. They do a great job. They let you know about the cc holds. If I leave my valuables in a Lyft ride, I don't expect the driver to check behind m, because I'm adult and should be responsible for my own things, but I've had several drivers contact me and also return things that I have left in their vehicles at no extra charge. I have also entered wrong info into the gps, and they still get me where I'm going. As with any company, things can go wrong, but Lyft definitely does a great job trying to make sure everything runs smoothly.",5,lyft.com

1000,"This is my favorite service! I prefer finding a trip on Lyft instead of going on a bus or a plane. First of all it's usually cheaper, second of all you can meet tons of nice people and have a nice chat during a trip.",5,lyft.com
1001,I have had Zero Problems with Lyft..... Drivers are nice and they show up on time....I have discovered that Uber sends alot of Folks to post bad reviews just because ...... UBER BLOWS HARD !! I AM 1000% SAFER IN A LYFT DRIVER....THAN I AM WITH ANY UBER DRIVER. Seems to me that alot of this complaints are coming from the Cincinnati and East Coast Areas...... You won't find those issues around here never heard of such holds of 25.00 and credit card info being stolen in L.A. Lyft is HANDS DOWN THE BEST OF ANY OF THESE COMPANIES..... THAT'S WHY THE REVIEWS ON THIS SITE CANNOT BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY SINCE IT'S PROVEN THAT HALF OF THESE COMMENTS ARE MADE BY ACTUAL UBER DRIVERS...... COMPARE THE BAD PRESS BETWEEN COMPANIES AND YOU WILL FIND UBER HAS ALOT OF RUDE DRIVERS AND NOT EXACTLY STABLE MINDED AT ALL .,5,lyft.com
1002,Driver no show. Only thing you do - huge fail.,5,lyft.com
1003,"Driving for Lyft is fun, meet new people and the pay is good. If you have a car why not join the team. If you want to earn 1000 dollars use my referral LAKEITHA424371 and complete 100 trips in 30 days and u will get 1000",5,lyft.com
1004,"I enjoyed the drivers and other passengers much more than Uber. Using the ""Line"" function it's very cheap too.",5,lyft.com
1005,I don't like Uber so I try to use Lyft whenever I can. Lyft's $5 hot spots make it easier because they are usually cheaper than anything else Uber can offer.,5,lyft.com

1007,Lyft has always been good to me. Their drivers are friendlier on average than Uber and the service doesn't seem quite so much out to take money from their customers.,5,lyft.com

1009,I mostly enjoy taking Lyfts. They don't gauge you like Uber does when demand goes up. The bad part is that it can be really hard to get a driver sometimes. I like Lyft drivers better than Uber drivers and taxi drivers by a mile.,5,lyft.com
1010,Lyft is a neat new ride sharing service that works like a taxi but an ordinary person drives you around. I tried it for the first time last week and it was a lot of fun and a good deal. It's a little bit cheaper than a taxi. The slightly odd part is that you're not supposed to sit in the back seat instead you sit in the front seat and talk to the driver just like it were your friend. My driver was cool so I didn't mind but I could imagine it could be weird with a bad driver. Anyhow it's a nice service and worth trying!,5,lyft.com
