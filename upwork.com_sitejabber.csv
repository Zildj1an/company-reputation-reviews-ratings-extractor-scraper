0,I'm going through an arbitration case with Upwork right now. It's horrible.  The best Upwork does is email between both parties before requesting $291 more so that the case can go to arbitration. It's the worst. I do not recommend using Upwork at all.,1,“Awful” 
1,"I am a working professional designer and thought I could earn some extra money from Upwork. The clients are generally terrible at communication. Countless people have accepted my proposals, wasted my time with back-and-forth emails, etc. Only to disappear and never be heard from again. In addition to the low quality clientele, the site is over saturated with mediocre, untrained awful freelancers. Upwork is garbage and I will never waste my time with them again.",1,“This company is a joke.” 
2,"I joined Upwork two years ago because a friend told me about this place for freelancers and I was looking for a good site to gain experience and earn some money. 

I immediatly encountered issues where despite my applications, no client was interested because of my lack of experience on the site, thus no profile reviews on my part which didn't make me appear like a trustful user. I gave up for a long time until I started receiving invites to interviews not long ago and I decided to give it another try, so I replied, sent applications... nothing. 

The most disheartening thing is the very little amount of money clients are willing to offer a freelancer. They want you to deliver a detailed work without paying as much as it's worth and they even ""mock"" you saying you shouldn't expect that much especially if you are new on the platform and with no feedback at hand. This is very disrespectful and not professional at all. 

Other clients are also very vague about what they want the moment you finally find someone interested, sending you references and telling what they need without actually showing you in detail. This will result in a terrible waste of time and again, for a very little amount of money. As if that weren't enough, Upwork apparently likes hiding your profile if you haven't earned money for a while, or used the platform at all even when you're actually in the middle of a contract. You use the site because you want to create a better portfolio and get the needed feedbacks to work more, but how are you supposed to do so if they hide your account from the clients? They don't really offer you the chance to grow unless you're lucky and the small ones are basically treated like slaves most of the time. You want a job well done, you pay as much as the freelancer deserves, simple as that. If you want a cheap job go looking for royalty free stocks and be happy with it. One thing many people fail to consider is that some of us are from Europe and the currency changes depending on your Country. Living in Italy I already face a considerable loss whenever I convert from USD to Euro and if we count the fees Upwork itself takes from the final price offered by the client, you may end up earning HALF if not less of what they are offering you. 

If you're considering the platform to begin your freelance career, don't even bother with Upwork, it's a no-go.",1,“Waste of time”

We are contacting you to let you know we have suspended your access to Upwork indefinitely.

Our decision is based on a careful review and the fact that you have submitted a high number of proposals for jobs on our site without many contracts or earnings. Unfortunately, this means the jobs posted by clients are not a good match for your skills.

I know this news is likely disappointing to you. But our goal at Upwork is to enable freelancers to successfully connect and collaborate with clients who need their skills and expertise. Unfortunately, this means we must part ways with freelancers whose skills are not in demand in our marketplace.

If you want to appeal this decision, you can email us at marketplace-appeals@upwork.com. Please note each case will be manually reviewed by our Trust & Safety team to decide if your account can be reinstated.

My expertise is in SEO and as you can imagine competition is high and there are a lot of so called ""experts"" that charge low rates and most of them land the jobs.

Backlinks will be on highly relevant and authority sites and will be permanent and contextual links. Recently, I've had a very good success rate building in-content links on already published articles on authority sites.""

He ended up placing 4 links on sites that had the lowest quality writing. 1 was de-indexed in google indicating it had already been penalized for spamming; 1 used to be a French e-commerce site that went out of business, and the domain was bought for history/DA and turned into a blog to sell links (domain name was complete irrelevant to the niche); 3 had all traffic coming from referral and direct traffic, indicating a PBN.

I asked him to remove the links. He never did. I ended up having to disavow the links.

What made matters worse, is when I contact Upwork and asked if I could leave feedback so other businesses would have a warning, they told me feedback was only allowed when payment was made on a project, but that it would count towards the freelancers job completion rate. I checked the freelancers job completion rate, at it was at 53%. Obviously, if someone misrepresents their skills, there will be a dispute.

Similar to social media, with its incessant 'you have a message' format, Upwork updates continuously, so it SEEMS to be in a freelancer's best interest to constantly monitor the site.

Well, bottom line, two almost wasted weeks.  

The one client is proving to be very difficult (does not get back to me, rarely answers messages) and NO other responses from anyone.

The point about the client is that even though she is a legitimate person who does need something produced, even if you do manage to get hooked up through this website, it is not just 'do your job and you will be fine.'

To Survive at Upwork, you need to be a Salesman, which is a Requirement by Upwork, not by the Client. As Once if you get hired, Client has Nothing to Do with you Selling Skill.

If you are not a Good Salesman, doesn't matter how experienced you are, you will get SUSPENDED! Simply!

I have Seen Hundred's of Suspended Experienced (Field Expert) people from upwork,in fact its an Hot Topic on Google. (just query something like ""upwork account suspended"")

Client Requires Field Experts, Upwork Delivers them Salesman. This is how Upwork is NOT CONNECTING the Right Candidate!

SUGGESTION FOR UPWORK:
 If someone is Not getting Hired, it doesn't mean he/she is not field Expert, it depicts he/she is Good At Selling!

Upwork can easily Improve its Algorithm by Including the ""Test Results"" (Conducted by Upwork) to Determine the Experienced Professional. Define a Threshold, below that Threshold may get suspended (if there are not earning enough)!",1,“Upwork is Connecting SALESMAN instead of Experienced Professionals”

Since most jobs are one-off and under $100, they are killing their freelancers profit margins.  Greed like I've never seen. 

They also are having problems with hackers.  They get into the site easily posing as clients and employers.  NO FILTER system to keep them out.  UpWork relies on the freelancers to spot the scammers.  Disgusting.

This assumption is pretty infuriating by itself, given that there's so much competition and many of the clients end up not picking anyone. Plus, why would you offer so many connects + the option to buy more if you don't want us to use them?

When I lodged a complaint about it, I kept getting poor responses focused on giving me excuses on why and how they cannot get a hold of the freelancer and long cumbersome details on what an 'escrow' means etc. My point was that I essentially paid for a a product that I did not receive and the entire point of going through a company such as Upwork is that in such cases they can be the mediator. After a few weeks of writing long emails, I gave up. I kept being passed from one person to another and eventually was spending more in time dealing with the inefficient customer service at upwork rather than my business. It may be a good portal to find cheap skills but it is a high risk model due to its poor management.

65,"Upwork allows freelancers to bill you without delivering work and OBLIGATES you to pay them.  It is not fair that there is no protection. I hired an app developer for my startup, and he took my money and delivered nothing. So I have no app and loss of funds. On top of that when fraud occurs all they do is cancel the job and do not offer you a refund for service that was paid with no delivery because they continuously state that their platform ONLY serves as a place for you to hire and process payment. 

Once funds are released, they have NO MEANS TO GO AFTER YOUR LOSS. As a client, they will only refund you the 10% in fees that you paid but what about the charges that the platform incurred from the fraudulent freelancer which is 30%. They do not even bother to refund you that 30% fee because by not addressing the Fraud they are monetizing from it. 

They advertise payment protection and top quality freelancers by showing their high job success, and the income earned based on the completed work, so you trust that this person is legit and knowledgeable. I would never think that they would take my money due the qualities that they portray on the platform. For a long-term project, I did not suspect anything until I realized that more than 50% of the payment was coming out and the delivery of the work kept delaying. Upwork sent me a message stating that this freelancer was committing fraud and ended our contract. Upwork accidentally cc'd me on another clients email that encountered the same problem as I, and they too were creating an app. 

Coincidence? I think not. I started noticing that the trends of the scammed clients were working on big long-term projects. Upwork needs to be investigated! 

I am looking for a lawyer that is willing to take on a case like this.",1,“No protection from FRAUD” 
66,"Actually i don't like share my issue to others, but this exception since it can ruin someone life and i hope i can protect other clients from Upwrok.

I used Upwork and lost $1150 + arbitrary cost $300 so total i lost by abuse and fraud of Upwork is $1450 and waste 3 months time.
It started when I post a job with detail description by Fixed Price
you can see the job desc on this link https://fileholic.com/share/Upwork-job-desc.png

As you see it show $1000 at the beginning but after Frelancer ask more, we agreed on $1150, with bold point it need work on Framework React/Angular for frontend.

Upwork has a great support during the progress and i don't have any bad impression about them.
Upwork also recommend a Freelancer to me (he is High Rate Freelancer with Good Reputation) and after Freelancer agreed, he start work on it and i already paid to Upwork $1150.

2 weeks later, He show me the sample via link to see the admin page and front page style, but he not work on it via Framework for frontend like we agreed before, so i ask he to not waste time anymore and do like we agreed with framework Frontend via React.

After 3 months later, he promised that he will deliver the same design frontend and admin like file that i already send to him 2 months before, but after i wait 2 months he show link the same page and same admin page like when he show on the first time without React.

So i felt i just fraud by this Freelancer, he not do any progress since 2 months ago, he just smart to explain but no work at all, also the fact that he never send any files to me that make me decide to stop waste my time with this Freelancer and plan to try find other freelancer that far better rather this one.

So i ask to Upwork how can i end of this with this Freelancer, and i already explain my issue to Upwork, and they said ""according to TOS etc"" i must click cancel from job page, and it can't done without confirm from Freelancer side, i really surprise with this funny rule, if Freelancer already send the files or do the work close with the requirement that will make more sense that Freelancer has rights to confirm my dispute, but this one, he never send me any files and never do the work closely with my requirements.

So Upwork not give me any choice to waiting confirmation from Freelancer, and like i thought 100% is correct that freelancer refuse to it and demand payment 50% from agreement, and it shocked me that this Freelancer use his chance to against my dispute and demand payment for nothing.

I reject it and explain i offer this job as Fixed Price mean i only able to pay that i want based on my description.
Do you want pay something that you already describe but you get nothing or see the item is not closely with you want ?
So i ask Upwork as middle man / protection as side who held my money from fraud Freelancer like him, and again i shocked that Upwork state they not able to as middle man and there is other party that able to make decision on each issue on Upwork platform, and that party is not even you aware, that party is Arbitrary.

When you have issue with bad Freelancer and want to help to solve your issue, you must pay $300 more for fee Arbitrary, again, i felt Upwork abuse and fraud me since they only want my money but dont want take any responsibility if there is bad Freelancer or bad Client on they Platform.

So I pay Arbitrary and finally Arbitrary decide to pay Freelancer 100% , shocked by this Arbitrary decison, and i want to ask to Arbitrary what is the reason i must pay 100% to Freelancer and they have rule to not have to explain everything to anyone.

So here i am, Fraud and Abuse on the first time with famous platform Freelancer like Upwork, before this i never get this experience with other Freelancer marketplace because other is responsible and they will do action directly for Bad Freelancer and Bad Client so as long you stay good and clear, you will be safe, but not on Upwork.

I want make a point or advice from my experienced and you must knew this before you use Upwork:

1) Upwork not responsible with your money as client, from any issue you experience from job or from any Freelancer.
They only want your money, once you pay to Upwork, you no longer has rights and Upwork doesn't care if you get fraud by Freelancer.

2) Upwork will not give you any support/help and he will throw your issue to other party that completely outside of between you and Upwork, and remember, Arbitrary fee is $300 upfront.
This Arbitrary also doesn't care with your money and you must explain all things from beginning to them, and they can make any decision they like, and they don't have responsibility with their decisions (It's like dreaming job when you can do anything and you don't need do responsible with your action ).

3) Upwork Community and Support is not a support, it build from them to build image they have great platform and support (which they are not), you will not get any help or proper support like on other Platform Freelancer Marketplace.

4) Rather you risk your precious money to Upwork, you better use on other Platform that want to take responsibility as middle man between Client and Freelancer and will not lap their hands to other party plus you not need to pay more for other party like Upwork.

While this is the rights of Upwork to lap their hands from any issue inside their platform, we as client especially need careful with their TOS, better you use other like F*verr or other like Freelancer.com

This Upwork or former is Elance (probably one of the reason they change brand is to avoid bad testimonial and try to rebrand new to give customers better company but, they really worse)

No files, no work you get and you lost $1450, that happen on Upwork for real.
After Freelancer win, he contact me by skype for laugh and mock me and it just give my day more worse.

Be Careful Guys.

Last One:
For Proof that i'm not boast, here is the more proof that you might interest to check
https://fileholic.com/share/Decision-Arbitrary.png (this the proof Arbitrary that win the Freelancer)
https://fileholic.com/share/Upwork-denied-responsible.png (this the One of the proof Upwork don't want responsible with your case even it happen on their platform)

Probably after this some Upwork team will try to defend their rights by TOS and blame that Arbitrary decision is final decision that everyone should accept, even the fact freelancer do fraud is the winner.
Also If you a Freelancer you can get free money like this Freelancer by abuse TOS Upwork, like you just need show link to your client that which seems to show you are already working, no need send any files, you can also can use any link you found from google, and make your client upset, and once your client dispute, challenge him, and prepare win on Arbitrary level for free money (some good Freelancer will not do this, but this method will use by bad freelancer person, and on the end, Client must pay that when they got trap)

I hope i already give you a point and warn you before you got ""trap"" on Upwork.

Since the merger, in 2015, I believe, they now take a larger percent of the freelancer's pay, which I feel is unfair and a lot more than it should be. But, fine. The site needs to make money. 

However, today, out of the blue, I receive this below message that my account has been suspended: 

""Im writing to let you know that your profile appeared to contain misleading information about your skills and/or experience, so it was flagged for review. I have carefully reviewed all aspects of your account and concluded you are in violation of the Upwork Terms of Service (for more details, please see the Upwork User Agreement, Section 3.2).

Based on this review, your account will be closed. Unfortunately, given the violation in question, our decision is final and cannot be reversed.

Please note that it is unlikely that we will respond to any future correspondence regarding this matter""

Now, reading other reviews, I realize that they have actually improved their pathetic and frankly, offensive Customer Care Service message. At least they are stating the policy, of which, I have listed here:

3.2 Account Registration; Profile

By registering for an account, you must complete a User profile (Profile), which you consent to be shown to other Users and, unless you change your privacy settings, the public.  If you are a Freelancer, unless you use the Site solely as an employee and Agency Member of a registered Agency Account, you represent and warrant that you use your Profile to market your business to others for the purpose of entering into independent contractor relationships with other Users.  You agree to provide true, accurate, and complete information on your Profile and all registration and other forms you access on the Site or provide to us and to update your information to maintain its truthfulness, accuracy, and completeness.  You agree not to provide and to correct any information about your location, your business, your skills, or the services your business provides that is or becomes false or misleading.  You agree not to register for more than one Client Account and one Freelancer Account without express written permission from us (except that you may register as an Agency Member of other Accounts as provided below).  You agree not to ask or allow another person to create an Account on your behalf, for your use, or for your benefit.

However, it my case, this ""violation"" is completely unfounded. There is nothing inaccurate about my profile. 

In a response that I suspect will also go unanswered, I suggested that UpWork revise their email response and consider providing an option for appeal. Stating that their random and completely unfounded decision is final, cannot be reversed and that they are unlikely to respond to any correspondence leads me to believe that UpWork does not value the basic foundation in which this nation was founded (think 14th amendment).

To not even engage in proper correspondence to try and resolve the conflict to re-instate the suspension is a first class act of bad business.  

I will not be requiring their services in the future.",1,"“Upwork randomly, unfairly and without cause, suspends accounts” "

So I sign up another account from my business profile. And after completion of 10-15 hires, which I paid out in full, they still suspend me. What irks is not that they feel something is amiss. That's fine. Gather info and rectify. But what irks is the way they pull the plug. Here is an example:

-Without any communication whatsoever, this is a final termination (not to be restored)
-Informs the client that they will not respond to  any request on this issue
-And if that wasnt sufficient birdie in the face, it says thank you for understanding.

Example: Hiring clients looking for the most experienced freelancers from US and paying them an average of $6.72 an hour. 
Most people would conclude that Upwork is the worst freelancing platform.  They are driving their reputation and brand down the drain.

Customer service? NOT! 
Transparent? NOT!
OK, the good stuff.  I have never had a client who did not pay. Gotta know this, almost all my freelance clients came from Elance. My five ThrowUpWork clients have been very good to pay.
The major problem-the so-called Job Success Score.  This is life's greatest mystery. For some reason my score dropped below 77. Invites are pretty much non-existent now.
ThrowUpWork reassures us that scores above 75 are good. 
Oh? Every job proposal has the little button activated, the one for a score of 90 or better.
They obviously have a lack of mathematics knowledge because 90 is NOT 75. 
I raised the issue on the message board. The response from ThrowUpWork?
'Life's not fair!'  Seriously.

I didn't want to take the time to figure it out and I figure for a pro it shouldn't be very difficult and fairly easy to do.  Now that I have taken the time to learn how to do it myself I see how badly they got burned me.  As well as how little they did.  

To start off the person who I originally spoke to was a male from India.  I Decided to hire him and he says you have to work with my other account.  This account has reached its maximum amount of customers.  I will message you from my other account and you can hire me through that account. 
       This should have been my first red flag...  I get a message from a female that he he is pretending to be.  However having  had some experiences on eBay and Amazon and how much they manipulate and control you ... I give him the benefit of the doubt and I continued on.  I had to give him some passwords and access to some accounts.  Since he's on the other side of the world the two step authentication kicked in.   He sends me a screen shot of the second question it was asking.   The screen shot also said which I caught ""someone from Afghanistan is trying to login to this account"".  I thought that's odd. He said he's from India.      Red flag #2.......   again I look past this red flag because I just wanted to become visible in google.   I didn't care where the person was from I just wanted to be visible yesterday.  

After I think it was 15 hours of paid ""work"" I still could not find my site in google.  So he said that I had needed to do link building which was very time consuming and that would run me $100 a week for 6-7 months.  I had said at that point if it's necessary I want to do it but give me a couple of weeks to make some money as well as iI want to research it and we can discuss it then.    I don't have any conversation with the guy and a week later I see $100 charge on my credit card.   This goes on for 3 weeks until I finally cancel  the card.   Not happy since we didn't discuss it like I had said I wanted to.  I just swept it under the rug and was just going to move on.   I didn't want go dwell on $300 when I had so much to do to launch this business that worrying about it would just bring me down potentially costing me more.  

I then started to learn google.  It turns out all he did was make an AdWords account with 15-20 irrelevant keywords and post the google analytics code in the section in on Shopify.  20 minutes worth of work tops.    l Again not pleased but I don't dwell on it.  It had been about 6 weeks at this point since I had been trolled out of money and I just wanted to continue to go forward  .......

I have sent them this email Greetings,  Trust & Safety Team,

While I understand that pruning the Upwork tree is the only sure-fire way to keep it leech-free, please consider reactivating my account, towards which goal I bring the following reasons:
 - I have indeed been very active in the previous month, that being because I plan to work through this website for a long time and I need to build experience on it, as lack of previous worked hours on the platform seriously hinders success with the applications. 
 - Apart from that, I was aware of the fact that there is a monthly limit, but not that you can use that up in any way that would endanger your account.
 - I am also aware that some of my Cover Letters were very similar if not identical, but that seemed normal seeing that the jobs had identical requirements. 
 - In this time, I have had replies from most of these employers; indeed most preferred to hire people with previously worked hours through Upwork, but at least three of these companies accepted my application, gave me tests already; one let me know they will notify me when there is a vacancy, from another one I am waiting for an answer and I just had an interview last night with the third, who will contact me very soon for starting training, as per their words, that is if I still have a working account with you, since I am not sure that they send payment through any other platform. 

 I include some screenshots here for verification. 
 You can also check my profile and verify that, while not being the most experienced yet, I nevertheless am not among the worst here and I should bring no losses to your table. Please reconsider reactivating my account if only with a stricter limit of monthly applications if you consider that fit, but at least help me not to have lost the time and hopes dedicated exclusively to this site lately.

Thank you very much for your time and hope to hear from you soon about it. 

Best Regards,

AbdElRahman

And this was their reply:Hello Abdelrahman ElBagoury,

I am writing to let you know that we have carefully reviewed your appeal and determined that your Upwork account will remain suspended.

We know this is not the news you wanted to receive, however at this point the appeal process is exhausted and our decision is final. If you have any open contracts you will be able to complete that work and receive payment through our site. You will not be able to submit proposals for new contracts, however.

We wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. Please note that it is unlikely that we will respond to any future correspondence regarding this matter.

I later found out paying for backlinks was discouraged by Google. Was the five star rated freelancer so stupid that he did not know? So even five star freelancers are not helpful enough to give ANY positive return on investment. I am sure all clients would agree, upwork promotes fraudulent behavior in freelancers, for example it helps a freelancer to do a ""course"" or buy a review (which upwork does not do enough to prevent) or listen to some ""expert"" freelancer who is so incapable that his business relies on upwork to succeed. On top of that, you lose 20% of what you pay as upwork's commission fee, so if you pay $1000,you are actually paying the freelancer $800. This is a waste of money as I found out the hard way, and many freelancers indulge in black hat practices that will lower your site's rankings. Even upwork tests have been asking the same questions for years..there are many sites which give the questions and answers of upwork tests and freelancers use these to pass tests.

Then they required me to upload my personal information (ID and bank statement) for further verification.

He repeatedly tried to blackmail me for more money throughout the job. I kept Upwork in the loop during the project and afterward, asked them to sandbox him for good so he could not attempt to extort anyone else.They PUNISHED ME! Upwork obviously approves of their vendors holding clients to ransom for more money. It now all makes sense. The more a vendor robs a client of additional monies, the more Upwork gets paid. If you value your wallet and your sanity, avoid Upwork like the plague. For me, this was like fending off a rapist, reporting him to the police and then being thrown in prison for assaulting the person who tried to rape me. Yes, it was just about this bad.",1,“They are happy to let freelancers blackmail clients and then punish the client for complaining about” 
138,"As long as one finds the professional(s) she was looking for, the system works. It's sloppy (as of the UI), but works: money put in escrow, the freelancer does the job, gets paid when finished and both parties are happy.

The issues come when any, literally any problem raises, especially for when the freelancer fails to deliver:

As of Upwork handling your money: It runs back from escrow to your bank account. There are no other options for this. Can't be held in escrow, no ""client account"" in the system or anything. Means, if the job must get done, so should be posted again, it should also be financed again while one waits for the escrow money to arrive back to the bank account...
Adding to this, if the freelancer doesn't approve this action (e.g. she was gone for good, so won't be around to do so, or simply doesn't care), it takes a good 12-14 business days (in my experience) to get the money back.

As of Upwork handling you, as the ""valued"" customer: If one asks for help, gets the standardized, copy-pasted answer. If one asks for a solution, gets the same thing, as well as an excuse (mostly ""our system works like that""...). If one complains stating this is not good. Gets a negative remark on her account....

I understand those who rate this site 3+ stars. I felt the same way for my 1st, minor project as I found the right candidate and the job was done.

BUT as soon as things go serious, investment goes high and actual professionals should be found for the large scale job, the system starts stuttering, the safety net is gone and one has to realize this site is useless, its processes are killing and very, very silly, as well as the support is impotent.

I definitely do not recommend using this site ever, for any business. Find someone better. It won't be difficult, go to any other provider...",1,“Horrible handling of both money and customer”

140,"I am a high profile freelancer, worked for some very reputable clients and with years of a successful freelancer career.
I've invested a lot of time and efforts to make my Upwork profile stand out and I did it. I carefully selected what work to show on my Portfolio, I've taken a lot of skill tests on the system in order to prove my expertise.
And it worked for some time. But guess what happened to me this year - they asked me for ID and other documents to prove my identity, this process was hard enough because they rejected my ID image and wanted me to take another shot at it especially for them and then resubmit it. I did it and finally after days spent I was able to verify my profile.
Now (a month later) they just permanently terminated my account without any real reason given. I received a blanket ""explanation"", that after a quick Google search I found out it was nothing more than a blanket message, sent to many Upwork freelancers, who also ended up with their accounts terminated.
I've tried to at least ask for the real reason, but they failed to provide one. They don't care for freelancers, they are only moved by their own interest on the back of the freelancer community. I believe anyone, who wants to start a freelancer career on Upwork deserves to know the truth how freelancers are treated. 
- you will spend a lot and a lot of time and efforts to build your profile,
- you'll be charged 20% (!!!) for the services, that you provide,
- and you may end up with a permanently terminated account at any time, with no explanation whatsoever and no possibility to appeal it.

All in all I think Upwork is a very wrong place to make a freelancer career online, really toxic for your career development. They will feed on you and your skills, but will dump you out whenever they want. You have no rights there. Like back in the days of slavery.
Don't get burned just like I did.",1,“Upwork is toxic for freelancer's career. Stay away from it!”

142,"I entered all my personal and financial info into upwork and then got rejected.  I sent this: 

You should have told me upfront that total rejection was a possibility.  I could have been working on getting real work.  There was just no indication of this.  I would never have gone forward.  I like businesses that are upfront and honest about what they are doing to collect your personal information.  My motto is honesty and integrity and that is inconsistent with who you are and what you offer. 

Then I got to thinking about it and said: You dont even have {my skill]  listed as a skill yet you have enough of those folks?  Lets see, you dont list the skill but you already have too much.  I am so sorry I gave you my information.  I want all of my personal info deleted from your system.

Then they sent mail that they didn't have any need for ANY of my skills.  So first they have too much of what I have but now they don't need those skills period because no clients are calling for them.  They can't even do simple logic or math.

Then I said: Your clients suffer because you limit the possibilities of who they can get.  I have unique skills and approaches.  You give your clients the first people who signed up with similar skills.  They should know this.  They should know they  might not be getting the best because you have rejected everyone who might be better.  

Then I said: Why did I have to provide a bank account before being accepted?  Are you going to try and steal my money?

Now I'm waiting for them to take out the verification deposits.  I will flag those as scam charges with the bank.

I also wondered if my picture helped them disqualify me since I do look older than 60 and maybe I really am.

143,"Contradictory to what they claim, Upwork does not offer any protection to writers against dishonest clients. I had a client who was paying me $10 for small content writing projects. The problem here was that for each project, I had to purchase some material which went up to $3 in some cases.

As a service provider, I believed I was within my rights to ask her how much profits I will make because of this -

Total paid - $10
(-)Cost of purchase - $2 to $3
(-)Upwork fee of 20% - $2 of $10
How much I actually make/project - $6 or lesser for more expensive material

And these were projects that took a consistent work of at least 6 hours at a stretch, plus all the actual publishing and other things.

Upwork promptly sends me an email saying I asked to be paid outside of the website when in fact the CONTRACT was STARTED ON THE SITE and work was submitted through it! 

The client said that they pay direct, which being an experienced writer, I assumed to mean that she had some understanding with Upwork for lesser paying projects. Now I don't know what happened of her but she may probably just start another profile or so. However, one of my sources of income is lost because such a big website cannot protects its writers from whom it takes a 20% commission EACH TIME when they have voiced a genuine concern and HAVE A WORKING CONTRACT. Plus, there's barely any well-paying projects there and most clients are not payment verified. Disgusted and thoroughly disappointed and would discourage anyone who asks from making a profile there.",1,“No protection for writers. Just tall claims.”

Secondly, the categories are so poorly designed that it's almost impossible to find the 'right' category because they are so inflexible and they pigeon-hole you into 'IT' or 'non-IT'.  For those who are adept in several fields, they almost get shut out of the right opportunities.

It asks you to basically fill out a new resume for some basic freelance work... ok. So I am in the middle of this and selecting jobs that I may interested in and Upwork is supposed to be verifying my bank account for payments etc. 

Then I receive an email from Upwork support, before I have even completed my profile mind you, stating they are not interested in me and I am not qualified. They know nothing about me yet!! I haven't finished filling out my current and previous work experience. What a joke!",1,“Waste of time!!”

171,"Clients looking for the best freelancers to hire are likely to be mislead by the Job Successful Score. This score doesn't reflect quality of the work, but rather how active the freelancer has been on the Upwork site. 
If you are an elite freelancer I think you should build your connections outside of Upwork.",1,“The JSS score is misleading” 
172,I used UpWork for the very first time and I lost over $500 from a scammer they admitted has been taking advantage of customers before.  They referred me to their legal small print when asked about getting funds back and getting a way to take action on the provider.  Highly recommend that you think twice.,1,“Scammers Allowed to Return” 
173,"Not sure how or where to start.  Working through UpWork has been a nightmare.  I'll try to summarize my experience.  All I wanted was a simple game for both iOS and Android.  Posted my job, received plenty of candidates and chose a freelancer based on her work portfolio.  Her name was Natasha Korecki.  I explained exactly what I wanted, gave her references, example of similar games and I even sent her a document with everything written of what I want.  We agreed on hours, which kept increasing due to her not being able to finish on time.  She started working ok design and graphics, which I did like, however, the final completed product was not even remotely close to what I wanted nor what she has been designing.  At this point, we're at the ending and we're going back and forth about re-designing.  Keep in mind, the whole time, I've been in contact with UpWork to makes sure they have my back.  We agree agreed on redesign but she needed more more, which she had plenty of to finish and what we Agee did upon.  Now, to save me the headache and stress, I agreed to just get it over with and keep the current design.  The game was submitted and approved by Android, however, it was rejected by Apple.  Once I went back to Natasha to fix the issue, she kept pushing me to start a new game with her.  I explained, we'll discuss once my current game is approved and good to go.  She has declined to fix it, unless I start a new game.  She also declined giving me the source code to have someone else fix, unless I start a new game.  I even received an email from UpWork stating that during their routine investigation, they found the freelancer being linked to a group that was kicked out for inappropriate conduct.  Now to UpWork.  I've been emailing them back and forth for over a month.  All I keep getting is ""unfortunately"" this ""unfortunately"" that.  I've been dealing mostly with Mark.  I explained my experience over and over but I don't seem to be getting anywhere.  Finally, he forwarded me to another team.  Keep in mind, this was all over email, there is no support/customer service phone number anywhere, so it's frustrating to get my point across.  I was excited to get a call from Michelle from the Talent specialist department.  Once talking to her, and spent few minutes explaining my situation, she tells me, I only assist in helping with hiring freelancers, but she can let her team know.  Now I'm even more frustrated.  But wait, there's more.  When I asked her to please have someone call me instead of email, she did not sound assuring as she stated, they may not be able to call, as we use emails for tracking.  As that might be understandable, we are at a different level now and customer satisfaction should be first priority.  Sorry for the long text, just wanted to share with everyone thinking about using them.  You're basically on your own.",1,“Horrible Customer Service” 
174,"I will skip the part about their huge fees which basically doubled last year, leaving a freelancer with about 70-75% of the money a client pays. I won't even complain about the stupid job completion getting ruined because a client left a contract open for possible work after completing the contract, and dropping my completion ratio for no reason and resulting in no more proposals.
What made me quit upwork was their overnight change in policy which requires a ton of information from me (a freelancer) that I refuse to provide - this is a completely unjustified invasion of privacy, I had no problem working happy with several clients without sharing my personal information.
And by refusing to comply with their overnight policies the money I earned fair and square are now blocked into their account - I have some doubts this is even legal.

- They keep your money for 10 days or more (I still haven't figured this part out) after you submit billing
- Elance allowed freelancers to send up to 16 samples of their work when bidding on a job; Upwork allows you 1 (!!!)
- Clients are much cheaper, but that's probably not Upwork's fault
- The very worst move Upwork made was increasing their commission to a whopping 20% (you get 80 bucks for a $100 job). Utterly ridiculous and greedy. I've even stopped responding to invitations.

Furthermore, they reject the profile submit when first income to the upwork by saying they dont have enough place to work because already sufficient developers in those skill category. This will be very frustrating for newbies who wants to start business by relying on them. If someone cannot believe, just try it. Its very simple.

For succeeded one who had hardly get at least $10 job, they immediately require video call verification which is all ok for me but something like I did criminal thing. Actually, there are no other sites are doing like this at least for freelancing area. When you success all this thing and continue work on website, when problem happens like client complaints you or disputed, they will suspend your financial account and sometimes revers all transaction you get earned by working even though you have significant work evidence and earned with your all burning effort. When you request to their support why this is happens, they says, because of your suspicious activity or because of terms of condition or privacy policy and not stating the exact reason. When you are complaint about this when you are 100% right, then they are answering as they have some bugs on their system.(Rare case of course but if you cant believe, just try it). Sometimes buyers are managing freelancers by threatening to giving 1 star rating even did good works which is definitely your effort is higher than 1 star rating but they are saying its freedom for buyers to left feedback according to their experience which is completely true. But in freelancer points of view, 1 star rating is definitely not good for future work award and even more, it doesnt affect anything if freelancer gives 1 star rating to client. So many of freelancers do some more free work to get account reinstated or 5 star rating for future work and it will make you like slavery to clients.

3. They have a things called JSS (Job Success Score) which is beyond idiotic, doesn't work and basically allocates you a random number/ percentage to indicate quality of work.

226,"This site:
-claims that it's there to help freelancers and clients hook up with each other, and offers escrow protection to make sure payments are fair.

However:
- if a client gives you a bad review, it doesn't matter who's in the right or the wrong; your account will be damaged, and your business will look bad, for months. Again, all it takes is one upset client. Do you really want to pay 20% of all you earn in order to work on a website that has rated you terribly in the public eye? I mean, who hasn't gotten one or two grumpy, impossible-to-work-with clients at one time or another?

- scammers galore use this site, and Upwork does little to nothing to filter them out from the real clients. Moreover, if you accidently get scammed, it's you that Upwork threatens to sue, not the scammer. You could get ruined by this site.

- their site is CONSTANTLY being ""fixed"". The technical difficulties they experience as a matter of course are huge and never-ending. My computer is sometimes unusable due to messages from Upwork that won't disappear from the screen and cover one third of the screen, no matter how often I shut down and restart my computer. 

- payments are grossly, unfairly, low. You're competing with people who can, and do, work for $5 a day. That's not Upwork's fault, but it is what happens when a site is global, and unfortunately, finding fair work on Upwork is just about impossible from a freelancer's point of view.

- Clients have you over a fire, and Upwork won't protect you from it. Say a client wants you to write 5 articles for them, but only wants to pay you for 1. The client simply ""changes his mind"" about the template and the topic each time you submit the article, saying that what you wrote wasn't good enough, but that he'll give you another chance if you actually write about this totally different topic instead. What do you do? To refuse means to get a 1 star rating and a bad review that you can do nothing about, but which will harm your business for the next 6 months. You HAVE to comply with this dishonest client, working for 5 days for him for the price of 1 day. Otherwise down goes your Upwork rating and your future potential business vanishes!

- Unfortunately, I found the other freelancers are sometimes dishonest too. This means that clients can be extremely jumpy, ready to give you 1 star ratings that actually the freelancer who worked before you deserves.

227,"I thought of trying it since I would love to work from home and manage my time, I did send some proposals, lowering my hourly fee, but it seems that people here are cheepos trying to hire at  3-5$/hr for professional jobs, seriously, (like: send me your portfolio of Villas and Luxury Condos so I can pay you 5$/hr!) definitely think the site should set the minimum at least by law of hourly  employment: to TOP it all I did receive one proposal  (from which I think is a real Company) and I am pretty sure it was a SCAM, it invited me to Interview on Chat on Googlehangout, I was supposed to be trained by them (Paid for it too) and then start, they wanted to send me a check so I could buy software for training (weird, not giving you my address) But could not give or send me more info by email on the job and it was very very vague. Anyways, PROS OF THE WORLD if you keep accepting 3/5 $/hour you are enabling these cheepos, I get it that in some parts of the world you can feed a family with that pay but these employers often are not from those parts of the World!

Clients: find your freelancers by posting jobs on craigslist/indeed/design sites. Not Upwork.
Freelancers: find your clients somewhere else. Upwork is BAD.",1,“Stay away is right” 
267,"I, THE HIRING CLIENT, TRANSFERRED MONEY TO UPWORK'S SO-CALLED ""ESCROW"" IN ORDER TO PAY MY FREELANCER FOR THE JOB DONE, BUT.... UPWORK NEITHER PAID THE FREELANCER, NOR INTENDS TO RETURN MY MONEY BACK TO ME.

I needed a freelancer to translate some documents for me, and tried to find one on Upwork.com 
After uploading the money for the job to Upwork's escrow, my account got ""disabled"", while I started to receive numerous and insistent requests from Upwork to send copies of my personal IDs.

I knew from before, that almost all employees at Upwork are hired from India, Pakistan and other South Asian countries (most of the programming work and customer support takes place in those countries; this corresponds well to the fact that at least 95% of all the freelancers in Upwork are also from South Asia). 

Therefore, for me it was out of the question to send copies of my ID to a private company, where it could be accessed and misused by the frequently rotating staff, consisting of hundreds Indian, Pakistani and other nationals. Nobody would want to have their IDs copied, forged, and then used in human trafficking, illegal immigration, financial frauds or scams, other types of crimes or even in terrorism.

After I refused to send copies of my IDs, and asked them to either release the money to my freelancer for the job done, or to refund the money back to the credit card, Upwork's so-called ""Customer Support"" did not do that. Each of my emails with a request either to pay the freelancer, or to return the money, they replied to by pasting in the same canned request to send copies of my ID, together with false statements that ""I must"" send my ID when requested.

I don't know much about laws in US, but the legislation of my country Sweden, as well as of EU (which Sweden is a part of), says that no private company can demand private persons to send copies of their private, sensitive IDs. Private companies can ask, but they have no legal right to demand. The only thing private companies can do, is to refuse to sell services or products. 

However, for me, living in Sweden/EU, and being subject of Sweden's and EU jurisdictions, Upwork's third-world employees (all disguised by western names, but still writing in the typical ""Indian/Pakistani English""), stated that ""I must"" send my ID to them. Such falsely statements are a subject for legal suit against this company. 

As per today, my money (a few hundred dollars) have not been refunded, despite my numerous requests and demands. People behind Upwork clearly have a policy of keeping the money to themselves on the excuse of ""routinely control"" and ""freezing"" users' accounts, hoping that the users will get tired and leave their money to Upwork.

By now I am quite sure that I will never see the money again. However, I do intend to draw these scammers into the daylight. The next Monday a police report will be filed on the grounds of money scam, and a legal suit will follow.

Furthermore - one could be a little confused, seeing this many positive ratings of Upwork on Trustpilot. However, there is a simple explanation of it. Since I work with IT, I have had experience with many other freelancing and other businesses, many of which, just like Upwork, too have outsourced their operations to India, Pakistan and other poor South Asian countries. Such companies, in order to battle with the high number negative reviews, engage their own employees to put in positive reviews. In this case, Upwork has done a remarkable job. 
But this only can fool someone, who doesn't know how these scam-based ""companies"" operate. What is the real ratio of positive/negative reviews of Upwork, one can see on Yelp dot com, and here on Sitejabber (I do understand it's difficult for Upwork to hold track of, and try to fake the positive reviews on all the websites full of their victims' complaints).

272,A complete scam site. Freelancers claim to be able to complete work they can't do and they get paid even when they don't deliver! It's impossible to remove sensitive data like credit card details when you try to close the account! Don't use ever!!!!!!,1,“Stay away from upwork” 
273,"First off let me say this. I was a long time freelancer on Elance and then was moved to Upwork when they merged. I held a 98% Success score for years, I was on their Enterprise Bench - which you don't know what that is you have to be invited by Upwork to be on. I was an elite freelancer and only had 1 bad review in 6 years, and even that one was edited by Upwork because they felt it wasn't fair. That being said, as an elite user, I had a direct line (phone) to their customer service.

Over the course of this year (2017) I discovered, from the inside as an elite user, that two main features of Upwork are NOT what Upwork says they are. 

The first feature is the Time Tracker they claim protects freelancers and clients alike. It does not work. It will cut itself off at random. When it does, all a freelancer can do is enter the missing time manually. As soon as you do that, you are no longer protected. All guarantees are null and void. I had tickets open to address the problem for months, Upwork never fixed the problem. They know the problem exists, but has never corrected it.

The second is the JSS (or Job Success Score). This ""secret"" algorithm is supposed to show a freelancers or clients success rate. It doesn't work at all. It's complete crap and a lie Upwork uses to draw in new freelancers and clients alike. For example, if a client leaves a contract open assuming they will have work later on, Upwork claims that is ""Neutral"" and does not affect your score. That is a lie, it does drop your JSS score. Any feedback given by a client to a freelancer that criticizes Upwork in anyway will be edited by Upwork. And vice versus. My score in particular dropped from 98% to 88% because of contracts that were open, but had not been active for a few weeks. That doesn't mean the clients or myself did anything wrong or negative and we should not have been penalized. We were. 

For a company that takes 20% of any job and monthly subscriptions, these two features should have worked properly. They do not. In my case, Upwork was making easily $600 to $800 a month off of me. For that much money a month, EVERYTHING should work. Yet Upwork knows and has not corrected either of these problems.

In addition, the customer service completely sucks. They do not abide by their own Terms of Service. They routinely ban both clients and freelancers for raising these issues. They edit feedback, forums, anything that criticizes Upwork as a company.

So at the end of the day, you are paying for nothing. The reviews are edited, the scores are not accurate at all, the guarantees are worthless, nothing on that site is true. If you are a freelancer, you will be exploited. If you are a client, you will be lied to. Period.

288,"I've freelanced a long time.  In recent years I've made 50% to 75% of my income through elance.  During its transition to Upwork, I was working on a long-term on-site job with an ad agency, so I only started attempting to use Upwork in May 2016. 

What a shock.  My history at elance was improperly transferred. It includes only a tiny fraction of my elance history - and it publicly displays earnings, against my will. I can't find a way to fix these problems.  Upwork is balky and crashes my browser.  It produces script errors.  Sometimes it just hangs - requiring me to fill out a form again.  And the job quality is horrendous!

Where have the elance clients gone?  The type of jobs and budgets I routinely encountered at elance are nowhere to be seen.  Upwork job postings are often incoherent.  Budgets are insulting, most of them impossibly low and completely unacceptable.  $50 for a five minute animated video (with a link to a Pixar clip and a note that it must 'look like this quality')?  $5 for an illustrated children's book?  These job postings are insane and I find it hard to believe these projects are ever eventually produced at the stated budgets.

How am I supposed to become a 'rising star' with a 'job completion rating' if every bid I post is ignored?  The same type of bids created active engagement and resulted in frequent jobs at elance.  What is it with Upwork's bogus ""tests"" and ""certifications""?  None of its tests even have anything to do with the services I provide.

The 20% fee per job is beyond the pale. It could be the final nail in Upwork's coffin.

I searched for Upwork in the business press.  I see it's failing.  One fund which invested $15 million in Upwork last year now values its holdings at $7 million - and it says the current projection is for holdings of Upwork to be ""worth nothing"" by the end of 2016.

If any company deserves to fail and die, it's Upwork.  It's a contemptible, sloppy disgrace and its abominable level of service gives the impression that something shady & odd has happened behind the scenes.

- it has a lot of trash projects: it was hard to search through low-budget projects and compete with low-budget low-quality providers even on Elance, and now things got about 5x times worse.

Upwork is a low quality marketplace, and I with that:

Suppose you managed to get one of these jobs every week, and multiply the income by 52 (weeks in a year). Your annual salary will never be satisfying.

Elance, and upwork are just a marketing company that gives you marketing talk but not results. I was ripped off ($800) by a freelancer. Because I'm not a programmer and I wasn't able to find out that the code wasn't right, I spent months to fill the database... The result is there, the job requirement is there. I'm the one who is right, elance Nor it's upwork didn't do anything about it. And they kept this freelancer there. They didn't allow me to update my 5 star review that I posted for the freelancer. 

The quality of freelancers is horrible. If you're running a business, and you need things that get results in business then you won't find so many options on those websites. 

There will always be a hassle. Most of the freelancers are not qualified for a real world job. And most of them are there because they can't get a job for the reason that I mentioned. 

Plus most of them has attitude. Plus DO NOT BELIEVE the samples. I've caught too many samples were fake. Copies are not written by them, they just claim it. If you hire them, what they will deliver is not even close to the quality level of their samples. 

Web developers, SEO geniuses are mostly not qualified. They can not deliver results but they will keep you busy and hopeful for awhile. So basically, in most cases, you're paying for keeping yourself busy and hoping for a good results will come. In the end, no results that bring results will come. Examples about results:

- Let's say you hired a copywriter for your direct mail project. After you send out the mails you won't get sales. Despite that you liked the copy. Liking a copy doesn't sell in real world. Copywriters there don't have a clue with BRANDING and IDEA..

- SEO will make you hopeful. In the end your ranking, most likely will improve on crap keywords only, that no one search for. There's a great chance that you pages will be blocked by google for using cheating techniques.

- Web development. They will make it half way. What I mean by saying that, either the code will need fixings, or they will put you in a wrong direction and couple years later you will end up starting over. The website will be slow. They will keep charging you for ""extra work"" that was actually what they were supposed to do at first place. Let's say you have a car that need body work and paint work. For a car it's easy to know. Since you're not a programmer, you won't know this. With the website developers on those website, they will do paint job first. They they will tell you you need a body work so it will be great. After body work they will say paint job again. By the time you're done, you will know that your car is not allowed to drive  or it's not efficient to drive at all. You'll buy a new car... That's what the hell is goping on with web ""development crap"" on those website. Part of they don't really know what they're doing and they do guess work. And some of the freelancers are just evil they deceive you.

The worse thing is, after all these are done to you you end up hearing marketing talks from the freelancing websites.... you can't take anyone to court, you can't have the freelancers to fix the obvious bad work.

Now they implemented new rates for freelancers, as you pay 20% for the first $500 made with a client, which is up from 10%! Then they charge the client an extra 2.75% now, so they are making an additional 12.75% on each job accepted on the site!

When it was oDesk, I was a top rated freelancers with a 4.99 rating and I had constant work.  After it became UpWork, the rating system changed.  At some point I lost my Top Rated status but was never notified about it, then after a while I became Top Rated again, but with absolutely no changes in my status.  I wasn't working at all during that period.  With oDesk, I always knew how my status was calculated.  Under UpWork, it's a mystery.

When there were technical problems with oDesk, they responded immediately; UpWork just makes excuses and tries to shift the blame.  Their site frequently goes down, but when I've reported it, they've claimed it was a problem with my computer (it's not - I've been a a computer professional for decades and know when the problem is my computer and when it's the site).

370,Upworks is slandering and libeling the freelancers with the jss. They need to be sued!!!!,1,“Upworks is slandering and libeling the freelancers with the jss” 
371,"As with the other reviews, I have to say UpWork has to replace its name with either CheapWork or BugWork. What the others say about the hiring is true. I started freelancing on oDesk Feb of this year and everything was great. I got hired for my rates (which was WAAAY above $5 lol) and I was at peace. UpWork had potential specially since the connects introduction. I had a few good clients because of connects but it's the rating and feedback system that's killing the freelancers.

The JSS isn't transparent or reliable enough, DownWork thinks clients know what JSS means, the private feedback system is causing freelancers to get penalized without them knowing WHY they were suspended or banned. Just go to the forums and you'll know just how FLAWED the JSS is. It's even known to cause your proposals to be hidden. HIDDEN. 

No matter how good you are in writing cover letters or even if your profile is outstanding, if UpWork's biased algorithm goes for the newbie who charges $5/hr then you're dead in the water. DEAD.

The most logical way to escape the wrath of an immature client? 100% refund. That's right, all your hard work is at the mercy of a client's dumb remarks on the freelancer. Heck, if I wanted free quality work I'd sign up as a client, hire the best and expensive freelancer, get the work, then threaten them to refund or they get poor feedback. Some freelancers win disputes, others spend money on arbitration to win (around $250), others they'd rather refund than go to all the trouble and stress of losing their account for no legal reason whatsoever.

The best part of UpWork USED to be the community but Garnor Morantes and Valeria Kochubei (community mods/bots) prefer fascism instead of democracy so that means no one, I repeat, no one can say or mention anything wrong with the website in the forums. Otherwise you get banned. The others are also NOT allowed to speak of the banned members, as if they didn't exist. Do you know how scary that is? Think 1984 except Big Brother is divided into 5 moderators. 

The most sensible of the moderators is Lena so if you have anything to ask, go for Lena and NO ONE else. Lena is generous enough to provide human feedback at the very least. She also drops hints on secret stuff sometimes. Hi Lena ;)

I used to think UpWork is the end-all but after the JSS mishaps, the bugs, and the sudden influx of cheap/scam clients (some of which are freelancers wanting to reduce other freelancer's connects), I was forced to go for private clients. I'm lucky to have scored two a few weeks back and they're definitely a cut above the rest. One client is paying me $30/hr to write articles and another for $50 per 500 words. On UpWork you're lucky if you get hired for $18/hour. Heck, with the current state, you're lucky if you go past $11!

About the bugs, the site has a tendency to change or reprogram things while it's ONLINE. The engineers don't care about the ramifications of changing the wings of a plane mid-flight but the passengers sure do. They also change things WITHOUT our consent. Like one day everything's fine then the next our message system is changed, our UI is different, our applications interface was overhauled, it's like you go away for two weeks and when you come back you won't recognize the site at all. No announcements, no explanations, 0 transparency with EVERYTHING.

Odesk was great. Really great. I miss it like an old friend and UpWork's like the bully in gradeschool who torments every other kid simply because he's bigger and stronger. The worst part is no one cares. I can't wait for the site to realize their mistakes.

In the meantime, I recommend you go with private clients or search for us on Freelance Portals.

I had one client where the platform worked well, merely because the guy was ethical; however, I ran into another seedy individual and in short, it has been a complete nightmare in getting payment.  We had clear terms, exchanged an agreement, I completed the work according to specification and time frames, had the work accepted, and then the guy decides he was not paying.  I contacted the Elance dispute department, only to find out that they could not offer me protection because of how the job was set up - it was an hourly job instead of a fixed price.  This absurdity now has put me out of receiving payment and was given a ""tough luck"" attitude from Elance.  

In addition, bear in mind, that the people that post jobs on Elance are looking for CHEAP labor.

380,"May 24, 2018 update:

I see nothing has gotten better at UpWork since I posted a year ago.  If it's any consolation, they are slowly going down in ranking, according to Alexa.  They've been in a downturn for well over a year now since they upped their commission to 20%.  

I sometimes jump into the ""Community"" discussion boards and read through the complaints, which are addressed by a small hand-picked group of individuals who lie and make excuses for UpWork.  Like how UpWork can't be responsible for phony job postings, it's too much for them to keep up with so they rely on freelancers to figure it out for themselves and then report them.  That's freaking incredible.  Worst site ever.

April 1, 2017 update:
I needed some Google compliance work done on one of my websites so I ran a job on UpWork and found a good guy who did a great job.  That was all fine.  But I was surprised that at the end of the billing week UpWork just chunked the guy's hours off my credit card without my being able to review and approve the work done.  

So I have to leave my review at one star as they do try to automate everything and are control freaks.  I wanted my web developer to review some advice from one of my SEO accounts and UW wouldn't allow me to message him the user name and password, as that would be considered paying him off site.  What?  Creepy site.  Very creepy. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you scroll down slightly you will see a review by J.M.  Everything he says is absolutely true.

UpWork has subsumed Elance and it's the WalMart for freelancers:  high volume + low prices + cheap labor = profits for Stephane Kasriel, the %&#@ CEO who sold us out.

And they are trying to automate the site and reduce staff, therefore boosting profits.  I have an avatar pic of Queen Elizabeth I on my profile, I listed my hourly rate at $285 to mock them and I've never even bid on a job there, and yet I get an email telling me I am a ""Top Rated"" freelancer now and I need to jump to the site and starting quoting jobs.

I'm not going to waste much time saying how many times their platform is down or the countless number of bugs we Upwork users have to endure.

I want to focus rather on the fact that they don't care about their community. They don't listen. I'm going to give an example for everybody to understand how they act:  they've introduced a new rating system (Job Success) that's completely opaque. You have some suggestions about how the system operates but most of the rating algorithm is unknown. All you have as a freelancer is a number. Really.

That metric's the first thing that clients get to see and you find suddenly that your >30 projects finished with 5-starts are replaced by a Job Success of 65%. No kidding. Your many 5-starts are removed from the forefront and remain in your profile where clients will not make to. 

Nobody will tell you why you have such a low Job Score no matter how many times you contact Customer Support and you end up out of business (no discerning client contracts anybody whose Job Success is that low)

To add insult to injury the rating system is retroactive and things that were perfectly acceptable before (e.g. closing a contract or having idle contracts) affect now your Job Success dramatically. You cannot do anything since it is already in your history. That's how they do things.

So, be careful with these guys. Do use their platform but look out: they cannot care less about their freelancers. You may be a quite successful freelancer using their platform and one week later they've moved the goalposts and you are out of business.",1,“Be careful with these guys”

I think the reason my account was shut down is ludicrous. Because my jobs haven't led to activity? I posted 10 private jobs of which only 2 people applied for after I invited over 100? I don't understand why my account was suspended? If my jobs are private, it's not like others are out there trying to apply for them. Of the two people I hired, one completely flaked out on me mid-job, and the other completed the job and was paid upon completion.  As far as I'm concerned they system failed me, which Is why I don't understand why my account was closed? What's the point of private listings, if you have to have them fulfilled? That's what I had understood one of the comforts of posting a private listing, as that I didn't have people applying for a job without me not issuing it.  I had a strict criteria of candidates, of which none applied. I wasn't low-balling either, I agreed to pay their market rate. Was I supposed to withdraw my jobs after nobody qualified for them? Or should I have loosened up my requirements and given the work to someone who was unqualified?

411,"Hi,
I'm a freelancer who is unfortunately registered on Elance website. I'm a British citizen, and I'm a native English and Turkish speaker, I'm also fluent in French and Spanish.
Please see my experience below to see how safe (!) Elance is and how much it protects the freelancers.
In December, I was invited by Simi Agarwal from Telematic Solutions from India to submit a proposal to a translation project for a Turkish TV Show. The job description on Elance website was the following:
""We have 50 hours [3000 minutes] of script of TV show which needs to be translated from Turkish to English. The entire script is already written down in word files. You just have to translate it. You dont have to do any time coding or transcription from Audios. We can pay USD 900 for this project. If you are available to start immediately and can write English without mistakes as native English speaker, contact us with your CV.""
On Christmas Eve I was contacted by Simi Agarwal who asked me to start working on the project immediately doing the translation of the script attached. However, after completing and sending the translated scripts for 3 episodes, Simi Agarwal asked me to watch all three episodes and arrange the scripts based on the video files, which was clearly not a part of the job description, and it was clearly not communicated to me. On that basis she refused to pay me by relying on Elance website's policy which says ""the client does not have to pay if they are not satisfied with the work provided"". I replied many times and told them that downloading and watching videos was not a part of the job description and that it was not communicated to me. This person is constantly making false statements and already chose the ""Cancel Project"" option which froze all the funds for those three episodes.
I would like you to know that this person did not fund Escrow(Elance's payment system for the freelancer's protection in cases similar to this) prior to the start of assignment, so that she can ask to the freelancer to do more work by threatening them with no payment, in my case double work, which was not initially included in the description. And when I refused to do so, she cancelled the payment and kept the scripts I provided.
A google search for ""simi agarwal scam"" gives a link to translatorscafe dot com website forum where freelancers explain how and when she was banned from posting any jobs on that website as she was on the Wall of Shame with ""1 as rating.
I already contacted the UK police about this person, and also her client in the USA who was very worried to hear about this, I will let everyone know about this process.
I simply would like to warn everyone against Simi Agarwal - Telematic Solutions, who takes advantage of Elance policy and steals others' work by providing an incomplete job description to convince people to accept the assignment and then threatening them with no payment if they refuse to do things that were intentionally hidden from the job description. If you have any doubts, questions or require proof to verify the validity of my email, I will be more than happy to provide you with the screenshots of my Skype and email conversation with Simi Agarwal.

Most of their contractors are scammers Indians
Aman Aggarwal Expert in Databases and Server Administration: is a good example

I worked with him and he just stole my money
All his reviews are fake 
Notice the number of overall reviews of users who submitted the reviews 1 or 2
He delayed the project over 30 days and then disappeared
I turned to elance to get refund
But their response was:
As there are no funds currently held in Escrow and the last payment released from Escrow was more than 30 days ago, the job does not qualify for a Dispute Assistance call or arbitration through Elance. We can not issue a refund without the freelancer's consent.
I told them that the work was not performed

415,"I've worked with several freelancers from Elance with about 60% success but recently I had a horrible experience with one of their freelancers and received very unsatisfactory support.  The freelancer is Scoped Design.  Here is what happened. 

I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO PROCEED WITH CAUTION. This freelancer completely swindled me out of $500 and did not deliver the work of customizing a wordpress theme based on Zeyn theme. S/he is the most dishonest person I've dealt with on this service. I had significant correspondence with freelancer prior to accepting job. Scoped_Design then contacted me stating that one of his jobs had cancelled for the week and offered a discount. Now, I of course know why the previous job backed out. They smelled something fishy. He asked for $500 up front stating that he needed to pay the outsourced SEO team, so since we'd had so much correspondence and he was very responsive I (stupidly) released funds. INSTALLED INCORRECT THEME: At that point, Scoped_Design installed a completely different theme on my wordpress site that I'd requested. This process took over a week. TOOK THE MONEY AND RAN: When asked to conform to original job request he did finally install requested theme and then I never heard from him again. ELANCE SUPPORT refused to assist in getting the monies back. They approved my claim agains Scoped Design but since the funds had been released, they seemed to have just dropped it. Good luck with them if you ever need assistance. I'm dismayed that they don't police their freelancers any better than that.",1,“I've worked with several freelancers from Elance with...”

From the perspective of the one providing the work, I have found that eLance playing field tilted WAY too far towards the freelancer.

On top of that, since I complained to eLance about the freelancer not doing the work and refused to pay, I seen to have a 500% increase in spam and viruses sent my way through email. How about that.

421,"I recently accepted my first job on Elance and I was completely ripped off. I was hired by someone calling himself ""Joe"" to write copy 8 hours a day, six days a week at $15/hr. I completed two days work for ""Joe"" and received a warning from Elance that I may not get paid because ""Joe's"" payment info wasn't set up. Now, being new to the site, I had no idea that people can post jobs and accept work without having any way to pay for the work they commission. I immediately stopped work and confronted ""Joe"" about the payment issue and he claimed that it was a glitch on Elance's systems. This seemed reasonable to me as Elance's Work View program, an app that Elance uses to track a worker's progress on a project repeatedly stopped working and I was told by an Elance rep that this was a temporary problem. Regardless, I told ""Joe"" I wouldn't resume work until his payment info was resolved. 

A few days later, ""Joe"" broke off all contact and his account appeared to have been shut down, by Elance or ""Joe"" himself I still don't know. I made a complaint through Elance's Dispute system and waited for a reply. Meanwhile, I googled sections of the copy I wrote and found it posted on a few different sites. I contacted a few of the site owners and heard back for one site admin that he purchased my content through a competing freelancing site called iWriter. ""Joe"" had stolen my content on Elance and resold it a different site. I added this new information to my Elance dispute. 

Today, I finally heard back from Elance. They dismissed all my complaints and rejected my claims. Now, I realize that I was partially at fault for not finding out that Elance hosts projects with no security for writers, but the fact that Elace essentially cultivates a situation where freelancers can be abused in this manner is shocking. I would highly recommend that any freelance writers who are considering pursuing employment through Elance do literally anything else.  Elance is a garbage company with nonexistent ethics.",1,“I recently accepted my first job on Elance and I was...” 
422,"Based upon the most recent reviews, I see that I am not the only Freelancer to have my Elance account closed with no warning and no response to my queries of support for their decision. I believe that Elance has other motives for closing accounts that are discriminatory in nature.  Out of a total of five jobs awarded to me, I had one review that wasn't five stars over 2 years ago, and yet my account was closed due to a high number of negative client experiences. I have asked for the evidence from Elance, but have been ignored.  With the experience I have in my profession, it is not unusual to command as much as $250 per hour.  My profile was set up with a rate of $55 per hour, but most invitations I receive rarely exceed offers for $10 per hour. I believe my refusing to bid on invitations for jobs that offer to pay $3-$10 per hour might be what Elance considers a high number of negative client experiences.  Based upon my belief, this is no excuse for closing an account because I should be afforded the opportunity to decline low budget jobs.  Does Elance close accounts for employers that offer rates well below minimum wage?  I haven't seen any negative reviews by employers having their accounts closed because on negative Freelancer experiences, so the answer must be NO.  Do they close accounts of employers that rarely or never award jobs? The answer is NO.  I've seen employers that have over 30 offers posted, and have only awarded 1 job.

Elance is a California based company that should not discriminate against Americans for not bidding or accepting well below market or minimum wage rate job offers.  THEIR ACCOUNT (Website) SHOULD BE CLOSED!  Maybe Freelancers should use Elance to hire an attorney to initiate a Class Action Lawsuit against Elance.",1,"“Based upon the most recent reviews, I see that I am...” "
423,"Okay so I had a user account for close to 3 years. One fine day one customer places a dispute against us saying we didn't work as she desired. We showed all proof. At the most Elance could have refunded the money.

No what they did was terrible and hard to believe.

They asked us to complete the pending stuff (which we said was extra and not in job scope). They said some bonus was paid to us (for different stuff and not this) and hence you have to complete the job now and they also suspended us from accepting any further jobs.

Fine working hard within 3 days we did complete what was pending. Client happy. She went away with her project. Now here comes the trouble. We now asked them to restore our account. They simply refused and said our behaviour had problems and this is not the way to treat a customer.

We simply don't understand having worked 3 years with more than 200,000 USD business and over 300 positive reviews and only 1-2 negative reviews how come we had behaviour problems all of a sudden. And also why not have the dispute process properly complete and why intervene in between and suspend our account.

I thought dispute process was real and Elance is only a third party. But now you sound more of a biased business.

Alright so our profile now closed our regular customers we shifted to a newly formed Elance account.

We initially just accepted only their work. But as work kept on flowing in and reviews and earnings increased we got more new clients and then again we started bidding. Our profile became again as awesome as the previous one in 2 years and we were starting to think we can rely on Elance now.

Sorry here comes the bummer!!! We did 1 job 3 months back for which the client chargeback and Elance sent us message that we have to refund back $1500.

But hey Elance.com has Escrow system and you are supposed to protect us from all this. But they simply put the charge on us and said this job doesn't qualify for Escrow protection. In normal circumstances any freelance is protected for upto $2500.

But what is normal? Working for 1 month, getting paid and reviewed and then Elance won't protect is it normal??

Again account gets closed!!!

Long story Short: Avoid them if you can and have other options. Never ever rely your business on Elance.com

Out of the blue my account was under review with no explanation as to why, other than form letters. ""Close out all your jobs"" and then we will review. I strongly feel it did not matter what I did ... something triggered my account to be shut down. I guess I will never know.

In the long run it is better off for me not having to deal with an unprofessional company that does not have the ""Balls"" to talk to me to give a reasonable explanation. I just have to apologize to all the people I have worked with who put the trust in me recommending Elance.

425,"Elance was great at first but I got notice that my account was closed due to ""too much negative feedback."" First off, I had a solid 5 stars on my reviews with clients saying that they would love to work with me again. Out of 10 projects that I worked on, I had two that I personally disputed. 

Client number one and I MUTUALLY decided (based on her lack of direction and my inability to pull more information out of her) that her going with another designer would be beneficial. That was MY idea. 

Client number two disappeared completely. We had our first meeting, discussed workflow and payment and then they stopped responding to me. I called, emailed through Elance... nothing. So I closed the project because I didn't want an open project that was going nowhere. 

These two reasons are why Elance closed my account WITHOUT talking with me about it first. I received the email this morning and when I emailed them back asking for evidence, they responded saying ""once it's closed it cannot be reopened."" I replied with ""I wasn't asking you to reopen my account, I was asking you for evidence.""

I had been working successfully on elance since more than 2 years as a full time web developer. I had successfully completed more than 120 projects over elance and I had 5 out of 5 rating.

One day my account was suddenly suspended by elance. I contacted to elance support team about this issue, one of the elance support team guy told me that, It is suspended due to having multiple accounts on elance and he send me a long list of usernames and told me that all these accounts are belonging to me. I shocked by seeing this long list, some of these accounts belong to my friends and relatives. 

 I requested him humbly with all the necessary information that, I have only one account on elance and I am using it since 2 years, I don't have any other account on elance. I also told him that if you found any account belongs to me please delete all these accounts. But, besides look into the issue he always send me the computer generated replies.

I requested him many times, but he always denied me to reinstate my account. I also requested him that, if you can't reinstate my account, please delete my current account and other such accounts, and allow me to create new account. But he never addressed my request.

I again requested him with few questions but he never addressed these questions and didn't reply back to me. The questions were;

Q) When this suspension will end, is it for specific time period or for lifetime?

Q) If you can't reinstate my account then when I will be able to create new account on elance or am I unable to create new account on elance for lifetime?

Q) If you can't reinstate my account for life time and can't allow me to create new account then please send me the login credential of other account, you believe it belongs to me? 

At last, I never heard any positive response from them, I again requested them to at least only enable my elance login. Because I have moved to Dubai from my home country for searching job, and I am unable to show my employer company to my last 2 years work history. My login details are not working it always showing me a message that my account has expired, and my profile is not showing publically. If at least my account login will work then I can show my employer company my previous 2 years work history.

I am not the only or single victim of this situation, you may find many of the peoples over internet facing same difficulties. You may earn money from elance, but you can't rely on them for career building and life longing work. This platform is best for the unemployed person who is not getting jobs for short period work but not for talented peoples. You may also use this platform for part time earning but not for full time.

I may start work on other platform like odesk, freelancer etc. But I will prefer now to get a good job in a good company. At least office admin staff hears you and look after your problems.

436,"SPAM / FRAUD warning about Elance user JohnVT a.k.a. vermontinternetdesign


 We posted a Job offer on Elance ""WP Ecommerce Customization"" 


This job has been carefully reviewed by specialists and very well documented before we posted it to the Job offers on Elance. 


Every bider received the complete documentations as well as all the source code and databases to have a look into it before agreeing on the job. JohnVT was one of the bider and stated he can do this (after reading the documentation and reviewing the source codes.) within time and for the offered amount, so i awarded him. http://www.vermontinternetdesign.com/


Shortly after awarding JohnVT from vermontinternetdesign he started to ask for more money, which i denied, as i had clearly stated the budget and he agreed upon that. During this 2 months JohnVT never informed me about the progress and just sent sloppy and grumpy 1 line answers back by email. 


I explained more than one times to him, that this project is very important to me and my business and i will loose money every day if it will be any longer postponed. Again, no reaction from him except ""Due date end of May"".

On the very last day / Deadline he updated the project with ""Need some more days"", without any explanation and nothing. I offered him to present a more or less working project by next Monday and another 4 days to eliminate errors and flaws. 


After that he comes up and suddenly states ""Job is not possible to complete. Client wants to do something that simply cannot be done"". 


He did not accept this offer and said he will need more time. The only thing we could offer him was to refund the $500 he got from us and we will cancel the job without taking any further actions. 


John Anderson ( vermontinternetdesign ) answered as follow : ""There are no refunds. Nor do I plan on sending you any thing. I applied the balance onto time spent on this project."" 


We guarantee that John Anderson ( vermontinternetdesign ) never ever delivered one single line of code or anything else for that project. There is no work that has been done as he by mistake stated in a earlier email. 


We have lost 2 full months of time to open up our business because of JohnVT ( vermontinternetdesign ) and therefore lost 2 full months of income from it. We have family and bills to pay and JohnVT did a lot of Damage to us with his ignorant and disrespectful behavior. 


All the details described earlier can be proved by email conversationand the jobs workroom comments and documents. If you need any further proof, please let me know. 


I would never write a fraud warning without beeing 100% sure this company knew from the first day on that they will never deliver any work and they feel beeing save as we are overseas. 

And he is right, Elance will NOT protect or support you in such cases ! Make sure you google for #Elance #Fraud #scam #warning #vermontinternetdesign #johnVT

I disputed and Elance claimed that I should pay him because he did the work in good faith. I even told him before we started the project that I did not want him to do anything for me and he still did it. He then called me a fraud. Wow, I guess I am naive to the real world for having faith in him. I have recently re-disputed the matter and is currently ongoing.

438,"I have now spent well over a week in the process of finding a good writer for a $5000+ project, and I found one through Elance.  I have absolutely no objection to compensating any intermediary that helped us find a way to work together.  But with my brief experience with them there is no way I would enter a business relationship with Elance.  After a series of baffling and maddening interactions with them over the past week, and twice waiting 15 to 20 minutes on hold, I now find:  In addition to their bizarre ""credit card authorization process"" (unlike anything anywhere else in the use of a credit card), it is their actual policy to charge an amount to my credit card in excess of what I authorized!  They actually think that's OK by condescendingly reassuring me after the fact that there will be a refund ""in 10 days or so""!   (The California BBB will be fascinated to learn about this, and there may even be a young Assistant DA in or around Mountain View looking for an interesting way to spend a month or two.)  I know incompetence, arrogance, and an ethical tin ear when encounter them.  When things start out rife with these ""little early signs"" it never gets better, only worse.  I finally did last what I should have done first, which is to look up on the internet whatever reviews from Elance users I could find.  Wow!    I had to tell of a perfectly good writer I could not proceed, and apologize profusely for wasting his time.  Back to Square One, and immensely grateful to be there.

I argued with them on how i have qualified for many exams and their criteria of closing an account is just unfair. They need to check various parameters and not just one parameter of how much job someone has gained. Check how they are bidding, how they are interacting with the clients. Do they act professional and do the freelancer give more thoughts on their bids. When i argued with them that they need to re-think on their parameters on which they decide whose accounts should be closed, they simple said they cannot help. I found like i am dealing with some Freelancer.com representative, which i found to be so irrational that it was hard to deal with them.

447,"elance.com | The Freelancer site full Schemes

I staying with the theme about having your Guatemala web site found on line I suggest any owner of a web site or business avoid using elance.com. The reasons are monumental to be brief, the company lacks any credibility and allows hacks and those without talent to offer services in the area of WP and SEO freelance services on elance.com.



If you happen to google elance.com complaints you will find hundreds of pages of complaints, customer complaints about elance.com. Complaints from customer being ripped off by freelancers offers SEO services who no nothing about SEO and Freelancers being ripped off by elance.com for payments. The complaints are real and cover sites such as www.complaintsboard.com/ and http://www.ripoffreport.com as examples. The company if one is behind elance.com never respond to complaints. I also came across this article http://freelancewrite.about.com/b/2009/03/01/is-it-time-to-revisit-the-elancecom-debate.htm which spells out elance.

We joined elance.com only to find that most of the jobs for WordPress and SEO were posted by companies claiming to have this area of expertise when in fact these job posts were to fix problems these Freelancers had created for there own clients. Needing some one who new about technology to solve the problem they created for clients from elance.com. Most job posts are for SEO after Google updates and those claiming to be knowledgeable about SEO are offering SEO Schemes to solve client issues.

Spammers and Scammers on elance.com can be found with almost every claimed job posting. Individuals claiming to need WordPress and SEO help. What these folks that are doing is posting false jobs, and are looking for free advise to solve there own problems.

Elance.com  allows jobs to be posted for violations of all kinds of work ethics. Back linking services about on e-lance, find me a 1000 facebook friends are a small example of the fact the elance.com does not care about what is posted on its site just about money.

Lets talk about money, elance.com takes it from all sides, a % from the person posting the job, a commission from the freelancer a whopping 8% . I figure on every job awarded elance.com is skimming at least 12% off the top. Almost as bad as Paypal. In order to bid on jobs you have to buy connections and must pay to be in categories or the services you want to supply. What starts as a FREE deal on elance can quickly have you shelling out over 70 a month in membership fee to be able to bid on 60 projects. Projects largely posted by spammers and scammers.

So what you may say, well for example elance.com lets unproven SEO talent use SEO Schemes to have a client land on the first page of Google and I mean elance.com has thousands of these back link Schemes offer by this claimed Freelance talent base. So I have an SEO freelance company do this to my site. It destroys your web sites on line ranking and credibility and the cost to repair will be far greater then the cost you paid to be hooked into this Scheme.

I was writing for one online paper and earning only $1.50 per 400 word article. I took the job only for the by-line. I kept my work, and that was very important to me. The major drawback was the amount of time I spent researching the articles I was writing. I would spend 3/4 of my day doing research for between 2 and 4 articles each day. 
I have since been asked to do many, MANY jobs that pay less than $1 per 100 words. I am not going to spend my precious time researching an article to make that amount of money. Being a writer is something that is part of who we are. It is an art and we should be paid accordingly.

Their site is infested with bugs. Messages go missing all the time, it's no big deal. Notifications are not sent for new messages, payments, etc, it's kind of routine. Their site fails to load all too often.Worst of all, they have the lousiest IT and customer services people, who would just keep giving you lolly-pops without actually solving the problems. My last complaint has been pending with them for more than 2 months, and they have failed to resolve the issues.

This was their technical side. Now, coming to the business. Ever since they merged with Elance, they have become the lousiest place to get work. I mean, I'm among their top 10% contractors. Yet, I hardly receive one invite in a couple of weeks. I need to send at least 50 applications before I get a single reply.

Basically, you won't get your money back even if a freelancer deceived you and it was fraud! Even requesting for a refund after a job is closed is pretty much 0%. It is up to the freelancer to refund my money and I'm 100% sure they will not refund my money.  Elance has no process for dealing with fraud after escrow is released and since I didn't know much about search engine optimization, I believed the freelancing company I hired.

I have received twice warning emails telling that my account is under review, supposedly because one (or maybe more, not clear enough) customers were not happy. In a freelance site, the proves for customer satisfaction is the rating: I have a great rating, 4.6 (the .4 left, were just because 1 customer wasn't 100% satisfied with the cost). But, in the warning email Elance states that they ""take in consideration many other factors"", but they don't tell you what are those factors, not even the exact reason of the supposed ""unhappiness"". At the end of the email, they ""threat"" you and put in focus they have the power to shutdown your account. But you will never know why, even to improve your attention level in case they're right.

They had us send documents verifying our identities and even had skype intervews to make sure that we were real people.

Their fees are:

Site takes 8.75% fee for every project you complete. Elance fees have been raised last year from 6.75%. Fee's on earning $4k/month = $350. Plus $10/month if you want to use Elance actively and appear higher in search results.

What I didnt enjoy most about Elance was that it isnot totally free  if you don't join paid membership, you will keep feeling like you are using limited version of Elance.

Great things about Elance of course is it's size, they take Escrow payments to ensure safety. And there are loads of helpful applications for accountability and communication.

I've been an exemplary freelancer. Recently, they suspended my account, too, out of nowhere and for no reason. I squawked vehemently and they caved, but I really don't trust them. Recently also, a client (from India I think) refused to pay me. They made me jump through a lot of hoops only to declare that I violated their policy, so ""no protection for you!"" They gave no explanation and I didn't violate any of their stupid, micro-printed policies. It was just easier to let the client have his money back (if they did, in fact, give it back). Upwork claims to protect its freelancers, through some bogus ""contract protection."" It's a lie. You have to fight for your money when necessary and they are NOT on your side. It's really bad business since they seem to make most of their money by collecting a ""vig"" from our sweat, not the clients.

510,"The platform is buggy and slow. Still, is is the largest freelancing site in terms of user base. With the acquisition of Elance, they are the only place to go. Enlace had way better interface, though Upwork still has some nice things, such as multiple categories for users.

As in most freelancing sites, the top 10% are getting 80% of gigs. The lower 10% gets another 10% of gigs, and the 80% down below gets 10% of gigs. It is very competitive, and many gigs are never awarded. Amateurs will not survive there, but pros can use it for certain amount of income. 

It varies, as some months you earn a lot, others you earn nothing. I would not recommend to depend on it for your single income source until you have a killer profile and reputation. If you are really  a pro and are willing to put up the time to create a killer profile, market it, study your competition, study market prices within Upwork, work and gather reviews for your profile, it can be a good income source.

522,"As a freelancer, I have had no problem with this website before. I see many people complaining about safety concerns, but I've never even thought of relying on Elance to protect me. Elance is simply to get me in touch with prospective clients. You have to make sure to take steps necessary to protect your money and work on your own. They do have some useful services (such as Escrow and WorkView), and while they have their faults, a bit of caution will keep them from being abused. I never send full copies of my work until the Escrow is funded, but I also don't ask for it to be funded until it's completed on my end and give frequent notice of my progress; if your freelancer doesn't do this, then ask for them to do so through the job. If a job is cancelled, I also keep a copy of it and make regular checks (usually once a month) to see if anything I sent has been posted elsewhere; if it is, I just issue a DMCA take-down notice and harass them (without the help of Elance) until they take it down and stop using it online.

Most of the bad experiences listed here spawn from people putting way too much faith in a single website with their money. YOU need to learn to take the initiative necessary to keep your work and money as a freelancer safe. Elance is there to help you meet people and take some simple jobs - not to be your mother.

A lot of people also seem bitter about disputes not being in their favor when they very well should not be. If the client specifies you are to do something or use something specific, if you don't do this and don't warn them beforehand, then of course they're not going to pay you. If a professor tells you to type something and you hand it in written, of course he's just going to put it in the trash can next to his desk. You need to follow the directions of the clients to ensure nothing is against you. 

You should also go through the ToS with a fine-tooth comb to avoid having your account closed. ""But it should be clearer!"" The ToS is fairly clear, but let me guess... you haven't read it?

I put it offers with maybe 30 places, only got a couple answers, because I want a good price for my work. The last person who hired me ended up having a lot of work for me. I write questions for him, they take 5-10 minutes a piece, and it pays $5 a question. So, I'm making 30- 60 dollars an hour with this client. He has been very professional, very available, and I haven't had a rejection or a problem with pay. I have a full time job, and this is still easy enough to make an extra ~500 or so a month. Sift through all the bullsh*t and you can find some great work on here.",5,“Worked out for me as a freelancer” 
550,"Great marker place to work with, no hassle in releasing the payments, once project is assigned, their policies ensure that we are paid timely even when most of clients dont respond when job is done.",5,“Excellent &  I Love working of elance” 
551,"I have been on Elance for just over a year now, this is one of the best sites for freelancers online, yet, there move to Upwork is a big negative step! 
I wish Elance would stay up and running!!!!",5,“Best Freelancer Site” 
552,"With the very challenging economic climate, the un-availability of suitable jobs and the challenges of commuting to work if you are employed, more and more persons are seeking work at home opportunities, this is a well known fact.  As a result of this there are many scammers out there who would stop at nothing to fleece on the innocent who are seeking legitimate work at home opportunities, jobs to do on the internet, at home. 

 I personally have known of individuals who are actually allowing others to pay them money just to give them one or two of these legitimate sites.  I am one such person.  I actually paid $JA10,000 just for someone to show me one of these sites and navigate me through it, this I could have done myself if only I knew of the website.

I spent many hours, days, months and money seeking legitimate Internet Income opportunities, at one point I almost gave up because it is not a very easy task.  It takes a lot of time, effort and energy to search websites to locate legitimate work at home income.  I only discontinued my search when I learnt about upwork.com.

It is a Website where you can find Freelancers to do any jobs you want done.  These jobs can be done at any time, anywhere.  Whereever you are in the world you can be registered on upwork to find available jobs that suits your profile, whether it's Data Entry, Typing, Executive  Assistant jobs, Website building, Transcribing, you name it, it's there on upwork.  If you want somone to do your job for you or you want to do a job for someone, the site is for all.

I have registered on the site, I am now employed full time so I do not get the chance yet to really actively seek a job, I will soon but I know of invividuals who are making a comfortable income on this site.  I will not tell anyone they will get rich if they register on this site but I can tell you if your profile is attractive and you spend quality time reviewing and working this site you will have success.

So all those who are asking you for money to register on a website or to  get an application from them that will help you to make thousands per day or week, I say thats an hoax, beware of those sites.  Legitimate websites are usually free to sign up and they do not promise anything that sounds too good to be true.  You have to work hard on upwork to accomplish your desired goal, that is of making a satisfactory income.IF IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE IT IS NOT TRUE.",5,“Legitimate Internet Income”

Thanks to Elance Team :)",5,“Best ever” 
554,"Brilliant, supportive, helpful. Got most of my work from here and they can't help you enough! Problem with recommendations is that it would be less work for me in the future lol
 But don't mind healthy competition, just can't stand it when you are bidding against people that work for $2 ph. But elance don't let that happen!!",5,“The creme of the crops” 
555,"I registered with Elance since July 2014 and I only started working on April 2015. I'm thankful that since then, I get lots of transcription jobs, paid well and on-time. I never had any issues with any of my clients. 

My tips are: 1) Never accept job without contracts or funded by escrow. 2) always keep an open communication with your client prior to accepting jobs.",5,“Highly recommended”

You can find any job in any price. It's difficult for first time, but when you go deep -- it became easier.

562,"I am a happy Elance.com user.
It's true: it's not that easy to find your first work.
This is due to the fact that you have to ""fight"" with many competitors all over the world.
Thus, just make sure to have a good profile, to distinguish your offers from other ""copy-and-paste"" ones, to Always be kind with buyers.
You can see this as a long-term investment: once you find the right buyers, and you are able to proove your skills, they will for sure get back to you with new projects, and you may even no more have to look for new projects on your own.

At least, give it a try!",5,“I am a happy Elance.com user” 
563,"I'm professional freelancer for 4 years and this is my favorite freelance site
It's very intuitive, very easy to find information for the client, take estimates just from the glance, and overall working process mostly intuitive and easy. 
I have one of the best clients come from this site.
Also I like that this site put no so much emphasis on numbers (like oDesk hours), tests, scores. I don't have time to make portfolio or perform tests but I have lot of to show or to say.
Also I like Elance that it clearly states where I am from thus it takes me advantage in competing with Indian developers - I have several times was chosen only by the fact that I'm not from India.

I can't point out some real downsize, there are lot of frustration about Elance because they rule out conflict into someone else favor, but it's natural - some one win an argue some one don't, who don't win - complains. At least there is some arbitration and you have a chance to win. For example at freelancer.com you don't have any possibility to initiate investigation if you wasn't paid. I don't think that this is real disadvantage of Elance. 

And also - no withdrawal waiting time, no hidden fees, fees are paid ONLY when you has been paid.

For all those reasons I highly recommend Elance to everyone.",5,“I'm professional freelancer for 4 years and this is...”
